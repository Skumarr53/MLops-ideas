REVENUE,"As I mentioned, 2021 sales were impacted by the intensified global supply volatility and issues, so let me now elaborate further on this topic."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"And providing we're continuing to drive profits upwards and onwards, the dividend will increase as a result of the increase in profitability."
PROFITABILITY,It will be the same with all the other high-margin secular growth end markets.
CASH_FLOW,"I think that as you look at the year, we're targeting roughly $25 million of free cash flow after all the CapEx."
OPERATING_INCOME,"In 2014, you guys were able to generate a healthy dose of EBITDA from your logistics supply chain."
GENERAL,And so it's – I would almost say it's impossible to win the category without QSR.
OPERATING_INCOME, for celebration our first positive EBITDA quarter and we'll look forward to talking to you after our next quarter.
CASH_FLOW,"Maybe talk about sustainability, one that – from a base, COVID perspective and when you think about these, the incremental cash flows that's come through for the company, right, to your point, Perkin was not a player in molecular like 12 months ago."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"Last year, we allocated a large amount to the payment of dividend and also to the renewal of the production."
CREDIT_INFO,"To be clear, Mark, I think it's $40 million gross loans of which we've impaired $15 million."
REVENUE,"And so far as incremental revenue, too early to say that."
GUIDANCE,Your guidance for this year assumes that you're going to get 400 basis points of an inflation contribution.
CASH_FLOW,"The pro forma revenue numbers are more stable, predictable, and more aligned to cash flow."
OPERATING_INCOME,"As you know, free cash flow is a bit more volatile than net income or operating income."
CASH_FLOW,"Or is that going to come out of the numbers next year, and then you'll just see better cash flow from the billing strategy and growth from net income?"
GUIDANCE,"So it's around 1 million tonnes, a little less than that in the guidance right now that is commissioning, that's not supporting EBITDA and will offset CapEx."
GENERAL,"Reflecting that debt pay down, the total principal face amount of our debt outstanding declined to $1.1 billion at September 30th."
PROFITABILITY,"Looking back on full year, we reported net income of $20.5 million or $0.29 a share compared with $43 million and $0.64 last year, generating an ROE of 7% for the year."
CREDIT_INFO,"So, it sounds like you're looking to actively pay down debt, not just reduce the ratios via earnings growth."
REVENUE,"The resulting operating working capital as a percent of sales was 24.6%, which is slight better than our prior year-end level."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"Now, there is a buyback taxation at a corporate level, so that is the major difference."
CASH_FLOW,But we also hope to do it in a way where we're covering that increase through improved cash flows.
REVENUE,"But of course, it will be a huge revenue trigger of course."
EARNINGS,"Over the past three years, which spans the pandemic, we have delivered exceptional earnings growth, top-line performance, and cash flow."
GUIDANCE,"We expect the effective tax rate to return to more normal levels of around 4 to 5 basis points above the statutory rate of So whilst our 2024 underlying operating margin guidance is lower than previously stated due to the specific factors I've set out, and we continue to expect the margin to increase to 30% or more from September 2026, being three years following the completion of the IW&I transaction as previously set out."
REVENUE,Second question on zircon production and sales outlook.
REVENUE,"But is it that the revenue generation is coming in under budget in Belgium or is it more underlying cost inflation is proving a bit more severe than you thought, hence, this kind of new restructuring?"
CREDIT_INFO,"At the same time, the cost of risk what we have recorded for full year of 2.7% was relatively low compared to devaluation and revenue growth what was recorded, and cost of risk was lower than anticipated because of number of factors, one is being in the retail loan book."
REVENUE,"For the full year 2024, we are increasing our total revenue guide to between $733 million and $735 million."
GUIDANCE,"Our effective tax rate, which was 25.95% for the quarter, included a cumulative adjustment to bring the rate to 25.4% for the year, an increase of 15 basis points from last quarter's guidance of 25.25%."
OPERATING_INCOME,Yet we are having the best balance or best EBITDA.
REVENUE,"And just to give you a number, 2021, the number of YouTube channels that had made at least $10,000 in revenue was up more than 40% year over year."
GUIDANCE,"So, if we now move on to the outlook for 2024, our guidance remains broadly unchanged."
OPERATING_INCOME,"It's very clear, our margin, perfectly EBITDA margin, which is fortunately extremely high."
CREDIT_INFO,"Finally, given our shorter-term loans turn over relatively quickly, we have the flexibility to respond to changing market conditions and invest opportunistically in a given region or asset type."
CASH_FLOW,But there are specific situations related to really cash flow which is why we took the charge-offs.
PROFITABILITY,"Just to come back on the Civil side, you seemed pretty confident the civil margins will be back in the high teens in the second half."
REVENUE,And what we are not seeing this year is boot sales.
REVENUE,"And if we extrapolate it, how to think about revenue growth for FY 2023 – or calendar 2023?"
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"We continue to support a progressive dividend policy, which has returned £56 million this year and increase the balance sheet value with fleet assets alone accounted for £1.3 billion."
REVENUE,"These initiatives are expected to increase output, drive revenue and reduce unit costs."
GENERAL,"While we had positive contribution from the good development in Services at the same time, from a growth perspective, our profits were impacted by the new equipment sales decrease in China."
OPERATING_INCOME,"We're going to see EBITDA margins in that, I'd say mid-16% to high 16% range."
GENERAL,"As mentioned last quarter, a portion of the loss experienced in Q4 2018 for these commodity contracts was reversed in Q1 2019."
PROFITABILITY,"In the near-term, we are reiterating our full-year 2019 guidance, which commits to the incremental improvement in revenue growth and margins throughout the year."
GUIDANCE,"While it is not typical for us to change our guidance this frequently, our objective is to provide our most up-to-date view with each earnings cycle."
REVENUE,"I'd like to now turn to our three key revenue levers, beginning with RevPAR."
GUIDANCE,"Accordingly, our guidance is AFFO focused, as we believe AFFO represents the best way of measuring the productivity of our equity investments in evaluating our financial performance and ability to pay dividends."
OPERATING_INCOME,"Commercial EBITDA was down a little year-over-year, as one would expect, driven mainly by softness in Western Canada, which impact primarily our non-fuel businesses like lubricants."
EARNINGS,And I mentioned this at the last quarter's earning .
GUIDANCE,"On a constant currency basis, the midpoint of our software revenue guidance would be up 7% year-over-year."
GUIDANCE,The view we've taken that's – or should I say the valuers have taken with guidance from us in terms of understanding the market is that a multiple sitting at about 12.5 times is a way of valuing content at a grassroots level.
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"Now, as you may recall, our Board of Directors at its January meeting, raised our quarterly cash dividend by 7.2%."
EARNINGS,"I mean, we have been speaking, I think about – of the support and earnings we have this year."
EARNINGS,Earnings benefited from a healthy balance of investment returns and income from mortgage banking operations.
REVENUE,And since most of my questions has been asked – and  for the explanation on the NPL sales.
REVENUE,"Revenue was 1% higher in constant currencies with 3% growth in volumes, partly offset by 1% adverse price mix due to a combination of positive price developments and adverse geographic mix impact."
REVENUE,"So if you look kind of across the portfolio, Puneet, Internet and tech clients today represent about 17% of company revenue."
GENERAL,The loss ratio was about a point higher in the quarter than for the entire year.
EARNINGS,"Following the change in the fee structure, we have stressed several times how we were moving into the direction of a P&L that would have been for the bulk and the vast majority of the earnings being built up for recurrent revenues and profit."
GENERAL,"So, this marketplace that we're in will overcome, I believe, in the mid-term anything that government inflicts on us."
EARNINGS,"As you saw in the press release, we expect 3% to 6% organic sales growth and 4% to 8% EPS growth."
CREDIT_INFO,"So, it sounds like you're looking to actively pay down debt, not just reduce the ratios via earnings growth."
CASH_FLOW,"Moving over to slide 22 – sorry slide 22, Dave mentioned at the start of the call the cash flow generation potential of our business."
GUIDANCE,Not obviously asking for guidance.
REVENUE,We were able to grow revenue by 10% in 2023 in constant currency terms.
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"As we noted when we announced a reduction in our management fee, management has recommended to the board that CMCT over time use substantially all of the cost savings achieved by the lower management fee to reward common stockholders through dividend increases."
CASH_FLOW,"And the additional free cash flow how we could generate, we will pay down or reduce our bank loan."
CASH_FLOW,"As we discussed our efforts to continue deleveraging will reduce interest expense, insulate the business from market volatility and improve cash flow."
OPERATING_INCOME,"What we have historically said, and I think we're going to stick to this, is we would like to increase our operating income or net income as a percent of sales."
REVENUE,"FanDuel attracted over 2 million new players in the half, which drove revenue growth of 63%."
GUIDANCE,"Q3 GeoMx revenue was $13 million, up 47% as compared to Q3 2020 and at the high end of guidance we provided in August."
EARNINGS,"Non-GAAP net income during the quarter was RMB 161 million, compared with RMB 239 million during the same period last year."
OPERATING_INCOME,"As we said, we want to be $400 million – close to $400 million EBITDA with industry average both on coverage and leverage."
CASH_FLOW,And how are you thinking about primary cash flow inflection if these levels are sustained?
REVENUE,Net sales in Japan in the 2024 third quarter decreased 7.6% in dollars and increased 0.2 of a percent on a currency-neutral basis.
CASH_FLOW,Recognizing free cash flow is super challenging to forecast in a growth environment like we're in right now.
GUIDANCE,"And I guess looking at how guidance was updated this quarter kind of post the strong membership gains, top line goes up about $100 million, but relatively minimal impact to kind of gross margin and not much drop through to EBITDA."
EARNINGS,"But maybe just given all the movement that you have, the supply chain investment acceleration, the increased promotional activity, the labor changes, maybe if you can just underline why you feel comfortable about the EPS guidance and – amidst this consumer change you're seeing?"
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,But then look at the core thing that really what drives your ability to grow the dividend and see how that's returning to growth.
EARNINGS,"So, just thinking about the increase in guidance, you listed EPS guidance for 2020 by 12%."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"So, at the moment, that is still the dividend policy and I think what we always told the market is, to the extent that the coal CapEx starts to drop off or reduce, then we will reduce the cover ratio to closer to 2.5 times."
GENERAL,"Is that elevated from where you had thought coming into the quarter and should we expect similar gross margin pressure as you're talking to in the first half, in the back half of the year given it's a several-quarter initiative to kind of get inventories right-sized?"
CREDIT_INFO,"Our debt restructuring and financing announced today will allow for continued progress, and we are targeting to begin clinical trials at year-end."
REVENUE,The first part of it is operating leverage and we're starting to see that due to revenue increase.
REVENUE,"So, it's probably – I mean, it's the same population that we're talking about, but it probably will increase the revenue opportunity by about 20%, give or take a bit."
EARNINGS,"I just wanted to clarify, does that include the distribution fees expected over FY 2025 as well as the earnings contribution for Vinva and also the comment on FY 2026?"
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"In January, our board of directors authorized a 6% increase to our dividend, which is consistent with the annual increase authorized last year."
CREDIT_INFO,"Utilizing our disposition proceeds, we repaid over $1 billion of debt in the second quarter."
GENERAL,"Costs remained pretty well controlled but devaluation of the lari last year and the seasonal viruses basically led to an increasing the loss ratio, which started to come back already."
GUIDANCE,"I don't have an ability to give you guidance in Europe, but that's all US patients."
CREDIT_INFO,"We are trying to see how we can deploy our liquidity in high quality assets domestically and internationally, predominantly through Sukuks or other investments."
GENERAL,"While we expect turbulent times ahead, management remains confident that the company will have the resources and the liquidity to survive the present crisis and to emerge as a stronger, dominant player in outpatient imaging."
GUIDANCE,"We were naturally cautious around, if you take the bottom end of that range on production guidance."
GENERAL,"But if you look at PVC and the Vinyl's picture, with the strong exports, are we likely to see some of that take place, meaning usually a very strong seasonal move downward in the fourth quarter in volumes."
CREDIT_INFO,"I mean, nobody just issues equity to delever."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"The HTLF board of directors has approved a quarterly cash dividend of $0.27 per share on the company's common stock, a 23% increase from a year ago."
REVENUE,"If we think about any change to the revenue trajectory, was it really limited to that weakness in the OEM piece of the business there?"
GUIDANCE,"No, I think the guidance that we gave was – it was pretty much – Samita, if you remember like what we had guided is what we've got right?"
GUIDANCE,"Then again, I hope at that time we can see a bit more about how we think our guidance is as the economy kind of shaping up for the year."
CASH_FLOW,We generated $1.4 billion of consolidated free cash flow.
EARNINGS,But we're still guiding EPS to grow more than 10%.
OPERATING_INCOME,"But I'll point back to, again, we were able to grow the revenue top line, the way we did it, and ultimately generate 19.6% EBITDA margin with all those things that are going on."
PROFITABILITY,"Over the next few years and with our current asset base, we believe this region can deliver margins approaching 30%."
PROFITABILITY,"There's inefficiencies when you launch with, say, upgrades or new strategies that will in long term improve the overall margin."
PROFITABILITY,"And some of our businesses, many of them have quite good ROEs."
CASH_FLOW,Recognizing free cash flow is super challenging to forecast in a growth environment like we're in right now.
REVENUE,So to that extent we don't see any significant impact on the top line or bottom line.
GENERAL,"At the same time, it drove our selling prices up, impacted the volume of the industry and us."
CREDIT_INFO,Because that would increase credit risk or operational risk.
GUIDANCE,"And so, the guidance effectively takes into account the supply constraints that we have and how much we can build ourselves and how much we can receive from our channel partners, our CEMs."
REVENUE,"And as those continue to free up, then we'll see the top line grow commensurately with that."
GUIDANCE,"Both of those are our – we call it, our three-year guidance, if you will, and our objective internally is to strive to exceed that."
REVENUE,Cost of product revenues for the quarter was $8.4 million and gross margin was approximately 77%.
REVENUE,"I'm trying to understand, what's the revenue scale of this transportation department?"
PROFITABILITY,"So that pressured margin, and again, that is seasonal in nature, so we don't see that occurring going forward as well."
OPERATING_INCOME,"Excluding non-recurring items, EBITDA would have been positive in the quarter."
PROFITABILITY,"So, our margins in the second half should be better than first half."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"And then lastly, for us, on the buyback front, I think you talked about $51 million over 18 months."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,Just wanted to follow-up on Jared's question on the buyback.
GUIDANCE,"Assuming interest rates and basis spreads remain at similar levels, and that credit performance remains consistent with the early results we are seeing, we feel confident that we can achieve both the guidance provided today for the remainder of the year, including the cash flow generated by our high-quality and well-seasoned education loan portfolio."
OPERATING_INCOME,"The operating profit is mainly driven by very strong cost control, as Danko just mentioned."
GUIDANCE,"Notwithstanding seasonality, given our strong performance and continued confidence in the huge market opportunity, our industry leadership and our ability to execute, we are increasing our 2021 revenue guidance provided in April on the Q1 2021  to a range of $3.85 billion to $3.95 billion."
GUIDANCE,"To conclude, slide 11 shows our guidance for the full year 2024."
REVENUE,We'll also build on the normalization of A&P sales ratio at a level much higher than 2019-2020.
PROFITABILITY,"So, firstly, we have seen some compression in the net interest margins during the quarter, like it fell down to Sure."
GUIDANCE,"Moving on to Centerra's performance, we delivered a strong finish to 2023, achieving both production and cost guidance for the year."
OPERATING_INCOME,"I think, in the back half of this year, we're already moving margins from EBITDA margin from 15% to 17.5% and then up to 19% in Q4."
EARNINGS,"Fourth quarter earnings came in lower than expectations, primarily due to timing and marketing results."
REVENUE,"With respect to Ingevity's consolidated earnings, both our adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin were down from third quarter 2020 due to margin compression caused by the impact of lower sales in our Performance Materials segment."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,I'll provide more detail on share repurchases in a moment.
OPERATING_INCOME,"Looking like the decrease in just EBITDA margin, EPS, but top line stays the same."
CASH_FLOW,We now expect free cash flow conversions to be approximately 80% of net income.
REVENUE,"For the Well, for Puregold, our current monthly sales is around PHP 100 million per month versus the PHP 27 billion in the first quarter."
OPERATING_INCOME,"We think we'll have more of inflationary growth rate of about 1% to 3% growth once we get past- or 1% to 2% maybe once we get past this year, as Mark said, and despite what you think might be a little bit heavier G&A above the line, we're still comfortable with the EBITDA guidance that we put out there."
EARNINGS,"We achieved net income per share of $0.12, up from $0.03 in the prior quarter, and up from $0.01 from the prior year."
OPERATING_INCOME,But the effects of leasing now really largely reside outside of the EBITDA calculation.
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,Or do you see in the medium-term that you'll be running an under-geared balance sheet given the dividend policy and your investment plans for the next two or three years?
EARNINGS,The EPS for the quarter is INR 17.24 for the quarter.
EARNINGS,Details of the special items for both the fourth quarter and full year 2020 and 2019 were included in the schedules that accompanied our earnings press release.
REVENUE,"However, what is the new CapEx level that we should consider once Dufry sales are back on normal levels?"
GUIDANCE,"In light of our lower revenue expectations, we are confident about driving further margin expansion through operational productivity and our simplification efforts, and are reiterating our EBITDA margin guidance of roughly 20.5%."
OPERATING_INCOME,"Excluding non-recurring items, EBITDA would have been positive in the quarter."
REVENUE,"Adjusted EBITDA margin for the first semester of 2021 excluding the gain in sale from the ready-mix assets sold reached a record of 20.2%, the highest since 2013."
EARNINGS,"And I think you mentioned in the past that even if you do convert to a net lease structure, you expect the contribution to earnings to be relatively the same?"
PROFITABILITY,The technology investments are related to enhancements in our digital channel and other initiatives to create operating leverage and efficiencies.
EARNINGS,"Finally, Ameren Parent and Other results also increased $0.01 per share, driven primarily by the timing of income tax expense, which is not expected to impact full year earnings, offset by reduced tax benefits associated with share-based compensation."
REVENUE,"No, other than the model that has been put in place by the sales team is working."
GENERAL,"Now, I can't tell you that we're seeing huge increases on our online revenues."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"We've done buybacks to buy back and to take 14%, 15% of the stock out of the market."
CREDIT_INFO,"At the end of first Q 2024, our net leverage ratio stood at 2.2 times, the lowest level in the last 10 years, thus reflecting our disciplined approach to financial management."
GUIDANCE,"Before opening the call to questions, I will briefly touch on two final items, ESG and our 2022 guidance."
OPERATING_INCOME,"And it sounds like you did a little bit in the quarter, but it sounds like you're also kind of in a – it's a little bit of a transition because that breakeven EBITDA in your mind is not that far off."
REVENUE,Its third party customer revenue is planned to be up significantly.
EARNINGS,"A handful of things, of course, and with the expectation that it's likely that the right constraints on the calculation of allowable dividend hang around for a while, even though they may not, but they certainly may, we found a level that we believe is something that gives us more of an upside ability as the COVID environment clears up, as the medium-term earnings power of the company becomes more known, both in terms of sources of revenue and what's happening with expense, et cetera, so that we wouldn't end up or have a low likelihood of ending up in an environment where you're making repeated changes to the dividend."
EARNINGS,"And finally, the last question is more a question of detail, but your midterm target on fee-related earning of more than €250 million, is it according to your definition of – the new definition of work core FRE or is it still the regular FRE, if I could say?"
GENERAL,"The five extra weeks of Tegrant added $4.1 million to EBIT and as you see, our All Other catchall category was negative year-over-year by $8 million and this was driven entirely by wage and other nonmaterial inflation."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"And as those earnings grow, we will also continue to grow the dividend."
PROFITABILITY,"So, firstly, we have seen some compression in the net interest margins during the quarter, like it fell down to Sure."
EARNINGS,"And as we look forward, let me address the question many of you will have in mind, what happens to Computershare earnings when rates fall."
GENERAL,"Yeah, I think demand is picking up and inventory is coming down."
GUIDANCE,"Additionally, we're going to be providing updates to our financial guidance, bearing in mind the impact that COVID-19 is having on our business globally."
REVENUE,"Collections have been steady for both the Trust office portfolio, which is approximately one quarter of its revenue coming from government tenants, as well as the strip portfolio, which are largely grocery anchored."
CREDIT_INFO,"Overall, this leads us with good liquidity and significant headroom on our facilities, thereby providing security, flexibility and options for the future."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,We're not looking to crank the dividend every quarter.
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"As we indicated last quarter, these higher levels of production will begin to translate into increased dividends to Sherritt."
OPERATING_INCOME,"It seems like some of these good ideas aren't equivalent, like the cabs were a good idea and some of these cylinder businesses are good idea, but the EBITDAs aren't as consistent as WAVE?"
CREDIT_INFO,The group will manage its liquidity prudently to ride through the current uncertainty and challenging business environment.
EARNINGS,"The cost savings that we laid out in our prepared remarks and are described in the earnings presentation take effect really from Q2 onwards, as we develop them."
GUIDANCE,"This expense was not anticipated at the time we provided financial guidance, but we still anticipate our operating expenses to be within the previous guided ranges."
CASH_FLOW,"As mentioned at our Analyst Day in New York, we are targeting to deliver roughly $140 million in free cash flow in 2016 as well."
CREDIT_INFO,"We were always in a special situation, given our huge liquidity supply."
EARNINGS,"Net income for the nine-month period was $903,000 or $0.05 per diluted share, compared with net loss of $5.1 million or $0.20 per share a year ago."
REVENUE,"Now, therefore, the H1 results in 2021 as compared to H1 2020 show revenues declined by 2.4% and EBITDA by 16%, which is a much lower decline than what we saw in Q1."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"So, Jeff, I was hoping we could start with capital allocation and the dividend."
GUIDANCE,Your gross margin came in roughly 100 basis points below your guidance for the quarter.
REVENUE,The sales reps change from being very focused on a particular product that they know well to a different kind of model.
GENERAL,"Under our two-year low rate scenario, we estimate the combination of spread compression, DAC unlocking and build in reserves would combine to impact annualized earnings by about $35 million in 2011 and $50 million in 2012."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,And we did direction of these dividends.
PROFITABILITY,"As an asset sensitive bank, we remain subject to factors expected to continue to affect industry-wide net interest margins in the near-term."
CASH_FLOW,"Well, so a couple of givens, one is that the company generates a lot of free cash flow."
REVENUE,"In Q4, we saw a total revenue growth of 33%, while the underlying EBITDA contribution grew with 72%."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"During the quarter, we amended our existing revolving credit facility to increase its capacity from $100 million to $150 million, and subsequently drew down approximately $73 million on that facility, including $50 million to fund our recent share repurchase."
GENERAL,"In the same period, our non-compensation expenses have increased by about $300 million and total expenses by approximately $1.3 billion in the same comparison."
GUIDANCE,"And secondly, as I look at the EBITDA component and your guidance, did you say that you have taken the inflationary or supply chain ."
EARNINGS,"And surely there has been some impacts in rising energy costs and maintenance, but they still cannot explain around €30 million of sequential earnings decline."
EARNINGS,We have also a turnover based rent element in this due to the fact that the store turnover is increasing and the real estate company has a certain element in their earnings which are linked to turnover based rents.
GENERAL,And so far there is nothing that concerns us at all.
REVENUE,"But you have an order intake uptick now, you're probably going to have sales in Q2 if you ever look at normal patterns."
EARNINGS,"And as a result, our adjusted earnings per share were $1.56 for the third quarter."
EARNINGS,"Short-term insurance earnings decreased 35% to ZAR 242 million, as motor vehicle accident claims normalized off a low base and investment income decreased given lower interest rate and a reduction in excess capital."
REVENUE,"I'm pleased we have a contract with them, with a minimum revenue guarantee over the next 3.5 years."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"We again raised our quarterly common stock dividend, marking 11 straight years with an increase."
GUIDANCE,"And I think that will then normalize the competitive environment, but you can also see with the guidance we are giving, we're not anticipating that that will be the full case throughout the entire year."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"And that's what we're focused on in the company, is generating the cash that's – in trough testing, our recommendation is to make sure that we aren't, in any case, talking about the dividend not being sustainable."
GUIDANCE,I'm pleased to announce that we are raising our 2021 revenue guidance for the DMD franchise to $400 million to $420 million from the $370 million to $390 million.
OPERATING_INCOME,"And so at the same time, what we're doing here is that we – we're very closely looking at how we can better absorb this and see how we can manage and better manage our costs to make sure that we can minimize the impact on our EBITDA and our global cash expectations."
PROFITABILITY,"At this point in time, how much is it eating into the current financials and margins, and when do you see that being a significant contributor rather than a drag on the numbers?"
EARNINGS,"So Wealth Management is now a larger portion, I think you said it's 24% of earnings."
GUIDANCE,"I think if we look at the opportunities that we have to grow, be it at our guidance or above, then clearly the expansion and then also the continuous increase in sell-through with the key accounts that we have started to work with is a key driver and gives us a lot of levers."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"Advantest is also cementing this partnership with PDF Solutions through the acquisition of approximately 9% of PDF Solutions' common shares through the third-party allotment, representing a capital investment of about $65 million."
EARNINGS,"Now having said that, as a starting point, it's true that when we look at Q1, we've seen a different kind of building blocks within the margin and the bottom line of TPS."
CREDIT_INFO,"We still have work to do, however, to enhance the quality of our liquidity portfolio and to continue to lengthen the maturities of our wholesale funds."
GUIDANCE,"As previously mentioned, today we are again increasing our guidance range for full-year 2021 consolidated adjusted EBITDA and reconfirming the range for distributable cash flow."
EARNINGS,Non-GAAP EPS increase of 16.0%.
CASH_FLOW,"And then I guess, I mean, particularly in regard to some of these moves to boost the cash flow of the business, can you talk about what sort of your expectations are, assuming kind of this 2024 EBITDA target range should get some benefits from this overall strategic realignment?"
EARNINGS,"And we definitely believes that one, the more efficiencies we put in the operation just as we saw now by growing to $9.9 million in revenue this quarter, those efficiencies are not only under costs and bottom line, they also enable us to ship more of the existing capacity and equipment and resources we have."
CREDIT_INFO,We have received a short-term extension from the existing lender and anticipate closing the new financing during the second quarter.
REVENUE,"But we're also, during the first half year, and especially in Q2, building inventory for the sales that are to come now after the summer break."
GENERAL,"With that said, we have seen a resurgence in COVID cases in certain areas across the globe and in the US, which may impact patient access and treatment."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"You know, is for the time being I just can reiterate that we are still looking to have a progressive cash dividend policy that will be implemented."
REVENUE,"So, we've added sales capacity the first – the early part of the year."
GUIDANCE,"So, I think $22 billion to $28 billion is a good guidance."
REVENUE,"In terms of geographical mix that had a negative impact in the operating profit on the operating profit in the quarter as we saw lower sales volume in Americas, where we currently have the highest margins."
EARNINGS,"So, bottom line is, we're definitely starting to see equipment shortages."
GUIDANCE,"I'll spend a few minutes on 2020 results and then discuss our 2021 guidance in more detail, including the planned effects of the IT Services divestiture and the latest update to our pension metrics."
CASH_FLOW,"In fact, we expect to generate free cash flow of about $500 million in 2014."
OPERATING_INCOME,"So, Prakash, as you know that, our business is just getting ramped-up, stepping back when two years back when we did the IPO, we said that we will get the EBITDA margins to close to say 20%, and that time we were around close to 15%, 16%, if I recollect."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"So, just a little bit more granularity on the buyback component."
CASH_FLOW,"And then I guess, I mean, particularly in regard to some of these moves to boost the cash flow of the business, can you talk about what sort of your expectations are, assuming kind of this 2024 EBITDA target range should get some benefits from this overall strategic realignment?"

OPERATING_INCOME,"On a GAAP basis, we achieved operating income of 2.9 million, this result compares to an operating loss of $22.2 million last year."
GUIDANCE,"So, at the moment, we are still looking for personnel in accounting but not the key positions are already very, very good Much expenses, so much CapEx is guided for the year."
GUIDANCE,"Just wondering at a high-level what's embedded in your 2020 guidance for net pricing across the portfolio, how that compares to 2019?"
EARNINGS,"So, what's happening now is you take a view around that, we publish as part of our earnings."
CREDIT_INFO,"We don't expect it to be a meaningful source of noninterest income this year, but over time it's a new source of revenue and loan growth that we look to expand."
EARNINGS,Slide 16 in our earnings supplement material outlines this in detail.
GUIDANCE,"While we don't give specific guidance, we are aware of signs of potential abatement of the headwinds later this calendar year."
CREDIT_INFO,"Well, what we've been doing, just to recap, when the year started in early March when the whole pandemic issue started, we were very quick to ensure the company's liquidity position."
REVENUE,"Now that you're seeing broadening potential success in the international market, it seems that on a bigger picture, multi-year area, I know you've outlined $1 billion in sales in China and the market outside of China for your products is materially greater."

CREDIT_INFO,"Despite prudently raising provision for credit losses on overdue payments, we retain a positive outlook on future receivables collection, given our current partners' robust financial spending and their ongoing payments continuously."
REVENUE,There's some impact of less sales and marketing activities due to the pandemic affected cost positively.
EARNINGS,How much conservatism do you think is baked into your earnings forecast?
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"Taking into consideration, the CapEx in Lima and Frankfurt Terminal 3, as well as dividends from our equity consolidated subsidiaries, we generated a negative free cash flow of €366 million."

EARNINGS,"So when we're talking about adjustments to earnings from operations, we have acquisition, divestiture and related costs."
CREDIT_INFO,And still there is some insecurity in regard of debt.
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,So should we expect to see a little bit more activity on the buyback?
PROFITABILITY,You're following the customer and how do you – the path of organic growth for our customers is the work with their customers and that's why we're right in the heart of all these companies' business.
GENERAL,"And secondly, on the monthly cash burn, as you mentioned, that was lower than planned."
GUIDANCE,"EBITDA margin will also stay within our guidance, between 13% and 15%."

GUIDANCE,"Scripps Networks revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $220 million, down just a bit from the prior-year quarter adjusted combined results and in line with our guidance."

REVENUE,"This decline was partially offset by strong Rupall sales, which saw unit demand growth of 33% in the trailing 12 months ended September 30, 2021."

SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"It's, first and foremost, focused on growth, paying a compelling dividend to our shareholders."

EARNINGS,"I'm on slide 6, which is our sequential earnings bridge."
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"And I guess just one quick follow-up, Jamie, on Dividend Finance."

REVENUE,"The big four carriers of AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon and DISH represented 96% of total incremental domestic leasing revenues signed up during the quarter."
OPERATING_INCOME,"I mean when you say $40 million in EBITDA this year at TV One, is that type of trajectory that we should kind of be modeling, or is this more of going to turn into revenue growth story down the road?"

SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"We will revisit buybacks again after this call, mindful of our updated capital allocation policy."
OPERATING_INCOME,"We still believe that medium-term leverage range of between 1.5 and 2 times net debt-to-EBITDA will be appropriate for the business, and we would expect to return any surplus cash to shareholders either through a share buyback or special dividend as we did prior to COVID."

GUIDANCE,"And then secondly, I presume that given what you said about sort of extras and, you know, utilization and that could see you down below the bottom end of that guidance."
OPERATING_INCOME,"Yeah, I think if you look at our ranges we're giving you on our both EBITDA, which we gave you at MEP Day and before."

OPERATING_INCOME,And that was another almost $20 million of headwind for us also on EBITDA.
EARNINGS,"And that's why when we enter new market like for Pune earlier and now Bangalore, our focus is on not just top line, but also on making sure that the bottom line comes through along with that and execution comes through along with that."
EARNINGS,"That also reflects on the other side, on the net income side, that is a positive expansion on the fees that we charge to the market."
OPERATING_INCOME,"This year-over-year decrease was due to the timing of payments to vendors, the shift in timing of the U.K. Mother's Day, lower adjusted OIBDA, and an increase in capital expenditures."

EARNINGS,"Adjusted EPS, excluding acquired IPR&D, was $0.17 for the quarter."

PROFITABILITY,And our gross profit margin shall be in the environment of 50% from 49% to 51%.

EARNINGS,"Now, would we use it for supporting the earnings?"
CREDIT_INFO,"But for the most part, our revolver is undrawn."
REVENUE,"The first thing I would like to say is that the company did not let go of the margins in detriment of more volumes, and all of that was due to our different sales strategy that we've been pursuing."
OPERATING_INCOME,EBITDA increased 37% to $12.7 million from $9.3 million in the prior year quarter.
OPERATING_INCOME,EBITDA that's sitting at 21% and we did speak about the cash generation and we'll talk about that later on.
EARNINGS,"Am I right in thinking that those – their impacts to earnings were only felt over the second half of the year, or was there also a December impact that was retrospectively put through in that slide as well included there?"
SHAREHOLDER_RETURNS,"We now have $9 billion remaining under our current share repurchase authorization, which includes the additional $5 billion approval announced today."

PROFITABILITY,And Interior geographic exposure was the other factor behind the higher decremental margin?
EARNINGS,"So if you're using adjusted earnings, you likely got in the low 80s, mid-80s."
