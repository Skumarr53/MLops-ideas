  ""I apologize for my voice."",
  ""Welcome to IDT's  call."",
  ""My remarks today focus on the first quarter of our fiscal year 2025, the three and 12 months ended October 31."",
  ""For more detailed discussion of our financial and operational results for the quarter, please read our  filed earlier today and our Form 10-K that we expect to file with the SEC next Tuesday."",
  ""Building on our momentum from fiscal 2024, IDT delivered strong financial results in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, including record levels of gross profit, gross profit margin and adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""Consolidated revenue has now increased sequentially for three consecutive quarters."",
  ""NRS along with our Fintech segment powered by BOSS Money, and net2phone each achieved robust increases in revenue, gross profit, and Adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""At NRS, we are focused on providing solutions to address the needs of our independent retailer market while heavily investing to develop new products and services to broaden our addressable markets."",
  ""In Q1, we continued to achieve increased adoption rates on our payment processing offerings and SaaS feature plans."",
  ""We look forward to continuing this momentum through the remainder of the fiscal year."",
  ""BOSS Money's Q1 results reflected our decision to enhance margins, particularly within our retail channel."",
  ""As a result, BOSS Money's gross margin expanded significantly and transaction growth slowed somewhat."",
  ""The enhanced margins boosted Fintech's Q1 income from operations by $4.6 million year-over-year, and in November, following the quarter's close, transaction growth rebounded led by D2C. net2phone increased seats served to over 400,000, driving a 13% increase in subscription revenue, despite the negative FX impact to its Latin American operations from a strong US dollar."",
  ""net2phone's financial discipline also contributed to healthy increases in income from operations and adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""In the Traditional Communications segment, our ongoing efforts to streamline these business units and improve their economics continue to pay off."",
  ""In Q1, the year-over-year revenue decrease was 4%, while income from operations increased by 2%."",
  ""In light of the strong financial performance across our key businesses this quarter, we are now on track to significantly beat the EBITDA projections that we previously had."",
  ""I'll wrap up by wishing the entire IDT team, including all of our colleagues across the globe, retail partners and investors a very joyous holiday season, shared with family and friends."",
  ""We very much appreciate your support and hard work, and look forward to sharing more good IDT news with you in 2025."",
  ""Now, Marcelo and I will be happy to take your questions.""

  ""So, I'll try to answer your question on immigration first."",
  ""It's really, in my opinion, too early to tell what will really be the end result of the new administration's policies."",
  ""My personal opinion is that you can't build things in America and make America stronger without immigration into this country."",
  ""So, if you're going to have tariffs, you need immigrants to work hard and help build America like they always have."",
  ""And that's my personal opinion."",
  ""But as for what really happens, I don't know."",
  ""One thing I would say is that we continue to focus on improving the product every day."",
  ""And that, that is, in my opinion, what really drives the results, not how many people cross the border on a daily basis."",
  ""But that's my own opinion."",
  ""And I'll just say to add on to what Marcelo already said is that it also lets us put more investment into the US market where we already have by far the best profitability."",
  ""So, if anything, it gets us to focus our energies in the places where we get the most payoff from it."",
  ""So, not a completely bad story, in my opinion."",
  ""I mean, so we have a large seasonal customer in the fireworks business that comes and goes."",
  ""They were larger this year than they have been previously, which is both good and bad."",
  ""And so, that's really the seasonal impact."",
  ""As far as your questions related to the kiosk, it definitely did have an effect."",
  ""And we also had a lot of new product launches in terms of our software plans, and that also really, I think, unfortunately also shifted some of the sales people's attention to educating customers on those new plans and away from pushing out more units."",
  ""But, we're back on track."",
  ""I don't have the numbers offhand how many we placed in Q1."",
  ""I do know that we ordered over 3,000 new screens."",
  ""I don't believe that they've all arrived yet."",
  ""And we've mostly placed them into hotels and entertainment attractions, and all of them are pretty highly trafficked."",
  ""I'll answer the question to you on net2phone."",
  ""So, you're absolutely right, the exchange rates are not helping net2phone right now."",
  ""As you know, a significant portion of the business comes from Latin American countries, Brazil and Mexico in particular."",
  ""When you look Our subscription revenue growth was 13% for Q1."",
  ""If not for this FX impact, it would have been 16%."",
  ""So, we are looking at""

  ""On behalf of the management team and everyone here at BioRestorative, I'd like to  for your interest in our company."",
  ""And for those of you who are shareholders, we obviously appreciate your support."",
  ""As you can see from the press release that we issued earlier today, we continue to execute very well across all areas of our business in the third quarter."",
  ""As excited as we are about our financial and operating performance this quarter and the progress that we're making in our ThermoStem program, it was really the preliminary Phase 2 BRTX-100 data that we announced this morning that is most exciting with very encouraging data for 10 patients at 26 weeks and four patients at a year."",
  ""Accordingly, we're going to break with tradition a little here."",
  ""And rather than review our financial results, I'm going to ask Francisco to jump right into delivering the same BRTX-100 preliminary data slides that he gave today at ORS PSRS 7th International Spinal Research Symposium."",
  ""Of course, if you have any questions about the third quarter financial results or ThermoStem brown fat program or our commercial BioCosmeceuticals business, would be happy to answer them during the call's Q&A session as well."",
  ""I'll turn it over to Francisco now."",
  ""I think based on the investor profile on this call, it may be better to go right to kind of slide 17 and get to the punchline of the data."",
  ""I think a lot of people understand the environment as well as the product candidate."",
  ""Let's talk about the results."",
  ""That's really the most exciting part of it."",
  ""So, as you can see from what Francisco just reviewed, the blinded preliminary clinical data of safety and efficacy endpoints from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of chronic lumbar disc disease are very encouraging with patient reported pain and function outcomes demonstrating a very clear and positive trend."",
  ""So, to summarize, at 26 weeks, like Francisco mentioned, 70% of the first 10 patients in the study reported a greater than 30% increase in function and a more than 30% decrease in pain."",
  ""Now, I want to highlight that while the 30% increase in function and decrease in pain have been set forth by the FDA as preliminary endpoints for efficacy, we find those to be somewhat low."",
  ""And we have demonstrated the ability to do far greater than those hurdles of 30%."",
  ""So, if you look at each of these patients individually, those that responded, they responded far better than the 30%, some going as high as close to 90% improvement in pain and function, and others circling around that sort of geography."",
  ""We're very optimistic about these results."",
  ""It really puts us in a position to continue with our enrollment, which we are – we continue to progress well, and we expect to complete before the end of 2024."",
  ""We know that if the data continues with this trend, we're confident that we will hit our efficacy endpoints for the Phase 2 trial."",
  ""And we will intend to present more of this data from the trial with an even larger patient population in the coming months."",
  ""I expect to be somewhere early next year, January and February with a larger group, both out to 52 weeks and 26 weeks."",
  ""Finally, from a financial perspective, I'd be remiss by not mentioning that we ended the third quarter in a very strong position with cash, cash equivalents and investments held in marketable securities, $13.1 million, with no outstanding debt."",
  ""That, combined with our steadily improving financial performance, provides us with additional financial flexibility and puts us on a path to profitability."",
  ""So,  very much for listening in."",
  ""That is – those are our concluding remarks as it pertains to our prepared script, and we're happy to take any questions that you may have."",
  ""Let me start by pointing out that this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""All forward-looking statements are based on BioRestorative Therapies' current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, and such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those implied by such statements."",
  ""No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed."",
  ""For details on factors, among others, that could affect expectations, see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as amended and Part II, Item 1A of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission."",
  ""Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this conference call."",
  ""BioRestorative undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law."",
  ""On the call representing the company are Lance Alstodt, BioRestorative's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Francisco Silva, its Vice President of Research and Development; and Robert Kristal, the company's Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Lance."",
  ""So, our lead cell therapy candidate is BRTX-100."",
  ""It's a novel cell-based therapeutic engineered to target areas of the body that have little blood flow and oxygen content."",
  ""The product is formulated using autologous or your own cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient's bone marrow, as well as platelet lysate that's collected from the patient's blood."",
  ""We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of painful lumbosacral disc disorders or as a complementary therapeutic to a surgical procedure."",
  ""The safety and efficacy data of BRTX-100 in treating chronic lumbar disc disease, or CLDD is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 prospective randomized, double-blinded and sham-controlled study."",
  ""A total of up to 99 eligible subjects will be enrolled at up to 16 clinical sites across the United States, and subjects who are included in the trial will be randomized 2:1 to receive either BRTX-100 or placebo with the sham-controlled."",
  ""As Lance mentioned, I'm please to review the same slides that I discussed earlier today at our podium presentation at the ORS Spine Meeting."",
  ""And so, to go through the slide deck, I'm just going to quickly jump through some of the slides."",
  ""Obviously, we have our boilerplate forward-looking statements."",
  ""And on slide 3, just want to quickly review the disc microenvironment, which is really important in understanding the impact of the product, the way it's been designed and engineered, because it's really targeting the harsh microenvironment that's found within the disc."",
  ""It has a very high osmolarity."",
  ""It has very low oxygen tension of about 2%."",
  ""Lactate levels are also low and pH which is extremely detrimental to cells."",
  ""So, this is important, because when you're developing a biologic and you're trying to remodel the disc, especially within the nucleus pulposus, if you put cells in there that are not acclimated to this harsh environment, you're going to have a lot of cell death that could potentially cause the patient to experience worsening symptoms of the treatment or the treatment might not work at all, because the cells need to be alive for them to actually perform their anti-inflammatory activities."",
  ""So, really understanding the microenvironment is critical when developing a product, and that's what we have done over the last couple of years in developing our BRTX-100 product."",
  ""So, in the microenvironment, as a healthy disc degenerates – let me go back, sorry."",
  ""As a healthy disc degenerates – something is – sorry, guys, but this is moving a little bit different."",
  ""So, let's go to slide number 17."",
  ""And in slide number 17 is the total of 10 patients that are treated using the product BRTX-100."",
  ""And in this particular group of patients that have been treated, you could see a direct correlation that at 26 weeks, 70% of the patients – again, this is blinded but very, very encouraging – 70% of the patients had an improvement in both pain, as well as function measured by the VAS and the ODI."",
  ""So, seven of the 10 improved and three of the patients did not hit the benchmark of 30% improvement, which is dictated by the FDA as being efficacious."",
  ""So, that's very encouraging from the point of view of seeing that the data is falling in line within the randomization of the patients treated."",
  ""And we expect that this trend will continue to grow as the patients move on from the 26-week endpoint to the 52-week endpoint."",
  ""And again, this is true as you review some of the other scales that we use for patient reported outcomes, which is – another one is the RMDQ, which is also showing a decrease in time in patients that have been treated or treated with the clinical protocol in terms of either being in the sham or the treatment group, as well as the FRI, which is another scale that is used to determine efficacy."",
  ""You see very similar trends in terms of the patient profile decreasing once the patients are enrolled in the trial."",
  ""So, to summarize, what we found is that very early, we're seeing very strong safety signals."",
  ""So, we have not experienced to date any severe adverse event or dose-limiting toxicity, our current dose of 40 million cells injected intradiscally."",
  ""So, this is very, very encouraging and this is our primary endpoint in terms of safety."",
  ""So, we feel very strong that this is going to continue throughout the trial."",
  ""More importantly is the efficacy, which is we're starting to see very strong trends emerge in both the VAS and the ODI showing significance compared to baseline."",
  ""And there's a responder rate that is also beginning to form now with the additional data that we're seeing that seven of the 10 patients met the preliminary efficacy endpoints of improving by both 30% in pain and function."",
  ""Another item that we're very encouraged about, because we're starting to see a lot of this positive data emerge is that we're contemplating a 26-week preliminary efficacy endpoint interim analysis."",
  ""So, that's something that's on the horizon for us."",
  ""In addition to that, we're looking to expand the product profile and indication of BRTX-100 to include cervical indications.""
]","[
  ""Congrats and  for sharing that data."",
  ""How many patients are enrolled thus far?"",
  ""Is it – are you only comfortable saying some number north of 10?"",
  ""So, when was that data cut, the two weeks, because when you show two weeks, it kind of makes someone think that there is not that many more than 10, because it's just two-week old data?"",
  ""So, when was that cut?"",
  ""So, now I can see why you're still sticking with 99 by year-end 2024."",
  ""When we see – when will we see the first unblinded data?"",
  ""Do you intend to come out with additional 26-week and 52-week data still on a blinded basis, or will we see it unblinded the next time?"",
  ""And you can't postulate when that unblinded 26-week look – interim look might occur?"",
  ""So, do you think the fourth patient that behaved like the other three, that back in February of this year, it was three versus one, and that was the split you were talking about."",
  ""Do you think that fourth patient, the saline they got just eventually started to work and that's why you have four 52 weeks versus the clear line between three and four last February?"",
  ""Can we be confident... No."",
  ""Can we be confident that the two placebos to be represented two of the six extra patients that turned four into 10, did they both get shams or perhaps did they get salines as well?"",
  ""That is... That's very helpful."",
  ""Rob, how long do you think $13 million last?"",
  "" so much for taking my questions and congrats on the really interesting data."",
  ""I guess, to kick things off and just follow up a little bit on the point you were talking about just before on the 52-week data where you saw all four patients respond."",
  ""Could you just give an idea of the magnitude of response for, I guess, patients one through three versus patient four, because I believe that's how it broke down at the prior interim blinded look where you had patients one, two and three responding significantly more than patient four."",
  ""And then, just, I guess more broadly, right, given what we have seen from the FDA seeming to be a bit more supportive of others in the cell therapy space, like we've seen with Capricor, Mesoblast, would it be possible that if you are able to achieve both pain and function in this study, could that be something that you could file for accelerated approval on?"",
  ""And then one last one for me, and I'll hop back in the queue."",
  ""Actually, that does lead somewhat into my next question."",
  ""I just wanted to ask you a little bit about some of the secondaries that you would be looking at in the final unblinded data."",
  ""And in particular, whether you will be looking at how the percent change from baseline varies between groups?"",
  ""Just for the actual final unblinded data in terms of secondary endpoints is something that you'll be looking at the percent change from baseline on both the pain and function scales for the different groups in addition to the responder analysis?"",
  ""And once again, congratulations on the compelling data here."",
  ""What I'd like to ask Lance, if you could remind us whether the pain improvement and the functional improvement are these co-primary endpoints."",
  ""And if that is so, would you have to demonstrate it at the group level, or would you have to demonstrate it within the same patient that they both would have to improve at least 30% on the VAS and at least 30% on the ODI for them to be called the responder?"",
  ""So, in the current study, you see, Francisco, that the seven out of 10 is the seven that responded?"",
  ""I mean, at the end of the day, if you were successful in both, that would make a story for a stronger argument for the product Yes."",
  ""It's considerably more than 10."",
  ""We have not talked about that publicly."",
  ""So, we'll continue to take that approach until we – as we continue to navigate the FDA on strategies of Fast Track and RMAT, et cetera."",
  ""I would... I would weigh in and commit to sometime in the first half of 2025."",
  ""But that's subject to further updates."",
  ""Only one patient received a saline injection."",
  ""Everyone else got the sham."",
  ""And then – and just to further your – to answer that as well, as you look at the 52-week data with the four patients, now we don't know which one have received the sham injection versus the BRTX-100, but there's considerable separation in the results, while all of them 100% achieved the 30%, it appears that one only achieved 30%, while the others achieved results far more significant than 30%."",
  ""So, we still see a separation there, and it's very possible that the placebo effect did take hold and the disc was further hydrated and lowered its pH and kind of maintained a healthier environment."",
  ""So, we can expect that, I guess, from time-to-time."",
  ""But to Francisco's point, the 26-week data, where we have the sham injection, those are a little bit more bifurcated between those that responded and those that did not, and it kind of matches up with the randomization of 2:1."",
  ""Well, I'll speak for Rob here."",
  ""But while we don't commit the timing, we don't anticipate having to do a financing anytime soon."",
  ""So, we have all the cash that we need to achieve our strategic goals and get to an answer within this trial."",
  ""And just to add to that, that's really important here is that keep in mind that we have not disclosed or released any MRI images of any of these patients."",
  ""So, that's something that's something to look forward to in terms of additional evidence of the remodeling that's happening within the disc."",
  ""And Elemer,  for your question."",
  ""I think I know where you're going, because there has been a bit of a change in thought within the agency and people are now looking at just pain as opposed to function as well."",
  ""It leaves us open strategically as we think about amending protocols as we go through this to really increase our probability of success by limiting it perhaps to just one factor such as pain, because we do believe that there's precedent for that out there now."",
  ""So, it's something that we're – we are discussing."",
  ""But as of now, the protocol is written for both pain and function."",
  ""And the good news for us is the responder group does clear that what we think is the minimal bar of 30% in both disciplines."",
  ""While also be showing some changes radiographically and improvement in the physics of the disc would be also very interesting and compelling, which we intend to do."",
  ""I would just say – this is Lance."",
  ""On behalf of our team, we really appreciate you following us and spending the time to get further clarity on our quarterly accomplishments and certainly your interest in our clinical data."",
  ""We will continue to update everyone as appropriate on new developments within our company, and we intend to have more data available in the January-February timeframe."",
  ""We're really excited to share with what we're working on."",
  ""So, have a great night and  again for your interest."",
  ""This data is several months old in terms of the two-week time point where some of the patients hit the two-week point."",
  ""So, yeah, we have more than 10-patient data."",
  ""Most of the patient data were – it'll be a lot more cumulative, will be presented at ORS in February."",
  ""No, it will still be blinded."",
  ""Again, this is an academic conference where we're presenting."",
  ""We have to be very careful how we present the data as well to maintain the blind."",
  ""So, that's something – even with the results are impressive and very encouraging from the point of view of the emerging responder rate."",
  ""But this is where we are so encouraged by the positive results is where we're looking at the possibility of an interim analysis at 26 weeks for the patients."",
  ""And I think that would be an appropriate time to have unblinded data where we have the sham versus the treatment group of BRTX-100."",
  ""I mean – again, I mean, it's all – we need to make sure we don't compromise the integrity of the trial."",
  ""There's a lot of logistics in terms of releasing, but if we were to do an interim analysis, it would be early next year."",
  ""And I think that's a great comment."",
  ""And I mean that's the beauty of a clinical trial is that if it's well-designed and the product is efficacious, you begin to see trends emerge."",
  ""And that one subject is part of that group."",
  ""We have – that was saline treated and it's very well known that saline does have therapeutic effects that are not long-term maintained, but they do impact the trial."",
  ""So, we're very happy that we were able to amend our protocol to have now a sham group."",
  ""And so, at the 26 weeks, this is where the sham patients are being recorded."",
  ""So, we expect that presenting 52-week data of these particular patients, you'll have a better delta and a better view in terms of what's happening."",
  ""But the 26-week data is... Go ahead."",
  ""And that trend is continuing."",
  ""Again, we have to be careful in terms of how we present this data."",
  ""We don't want to unblind, but the trend is continuing with one patient having some effect based on the randomization, but the other three patients are significantly lower, which is, again, the numbers range, but they're greater than 60% improvement compared to baseline."",
  ""I mean, it's something that it's – again, I mean, this is 10 patients, but the data is very encouraging considering what's been out there with either other clinical trials in the disc space or investigator-initiated studies."",
  ""So, we're very encouraged that this data, if it continues to show these effects that we could potentially use this data for pivotal, which would really help us and accelerate the commercialization of the product, which is, I think, really needed in terms of the overall market in the US in getting cell-based therapies approved, especially when you're looking at these musculoskeletal disorders, which are tremendous."",
  ""So, there's a huge market for it, and we're very confident with our product."",
  ""Michael, I'll also mention that because of what you just mentioned in the temperature at the FDA in terms of Can you repeat the question?"",
  ""I'm sorry, I didn't understand it."",
  ""So, the FDA has guided that it's a 30% change, is their MCID that they've put into our protocol."",
  ""We feel that we can exceed that based on the trending data points that are coming out."",
  ""So, we feel very strongly that we're going to not only hit the – our MCID in terms of efficacy, but we will be able to exceed that."",
  ""And we're also looking at radiographic endpoints and a whole host of other measures that we think would be just good general information for people to have to demonstrate that it's not just a subjective issue, but if we can demonstrate that there's radiographic improvement in the disc, that's a very powerful set of data."",
  ""They have to both respond in both the VAS, as well as the ODI to be labeled a responder.""

  ""Today, as a reminder, I will present our main strategy in the first part."",
  ""And then on So you know that we are split into three segments in SKAKO Vibration."",
  ""In SKAKO Vibration, we design, we develop and we sell vibrating equipment."",
  ""And this equipment can move, sort and clean any type of bulk material."",
  ""And this is what we do in these three segments."",
  ""So the first one is the Minerals segment."",
  ""This is a historical segment and it's most important in terms of revenue."",
  ""In the last quarter, it represented a little less than half of our revenue."",
  ""And the second segment is the Fasteners industry."",
  ""That's an industry where our customer and the end user of our equipment produce little metallic part."",
  ""Of course, it's a niche sector, producer of nuts, of screws."",
  ""But we are a leader in this sector with a very, very strong reputation."",
  ""And to finish, this is a segment which is linked to the automotive and the construction building sector."",
  ""And the last segment that we have, which represent nowadays or in the last quarter, between one quarter and one-third of our revenue, that's Recycling segment."",
  ""Some years ago, it represented only less than 10% of our revenue, but we have been developing this segment for some years now."",
  ""And now, it's one of our main segments in our activity."",
  ""And the main part of our strategy is to develop this Recycling segment."",
  ""The reason of that – that, of course, it's a market which is expected to grow significantly in the next years, next decades, I would say."",
  ""And the reason of that is that there are main three reason, some government incentive, especially, in the European Union, some investment made as well by the private sector, which boost the activity."",
  ""And all of that is pushed by some consumer and society drive."",
  ""So a very strong trend, which is present to develop this segment."",
  ""And that's the reason why five years ago we decided to make the acquisition of a Spanish company, DARTEK, which is now SKAKO Dartek and fully integrated in the group."",
  ""And DARTEK had developed specific product by batching product for this Recycling segment."",
  ""And we are – yeah, we are developing our sales force, as Thomas said, to be able to promote and to sell this product coming from a Spanish company to our network, global sales network."",
  ""Few words about the Recycling segment for us."",
  ""So the Recycling segment is split with the five main sub-segment for us."",
  ""It's a complex segment because we have to work with many, many different product, which require many different technology, many different knowledge."",
  ""So when we talk about waste, the first thing that you think is about household waste, of course."",
  ""This is the first sub-segment that we have."",
  ""It's – this part is typically complex because household waste means a lot of different type of waste."",
  ""Usually, this type of waste is treated in one – first plant, and then the waste is sorted in different type of ways."",
  ""It could be glass, steel, paper And especially, the second type of sub-segment that we have is the metal recycling, as well as The third one is the glass recycling, which is very known, especially in Europe."",
  ""We have a tradition and use to recycle glass for a long time now."",
  ""So very established, I would say is one of the more established sub-segment of the Recycling segment."",
  ""Fifth segment, which is paper and plastic, a bit different, but the material is more or less the same for us, very – a very light material."",
  ""And fifth one, which is the construction and demolition waste recycling."",
  ""And this is the sub-segment that I would like to focus a little bit with you."",
  ""We could add on the top of that, in addition to these five segments – sub-segments."",
  ""We could have a sixth one, which is other type of recycling."",
  ""It could be a – because nowadays, we can make the recycling of any type of things."",
  ""So it could be a slag, anything like that that we have in the sixth sub-segment."",
  ""But let's focus on the construction and demolition waste."",
  ""And I have to come back for that to what I already presented to you some months ago."",
  ""The other main segment that we have, the Minerals segment, which is split in main three sub-segments."",
  ""The first one is the mining industry."",
  ""And for us, it's mainly mining customer in Africa, and especially as Thomas say, that for instance, this big order that we secure within the last months is coming from this sector The second sub-segment that we have in the Minerals segment is the construction industry."",
  ""So here, we talk about more quarries than mining and our customer here have mage stones, I would say, of cement to build the buildings or roads."",
  ""And then the third sub-segment is iron steel industry where our But yeah, I would like to focus here on the construction industry because, this is where there is a link between the Recycling segment and the Minerals segment."",
  ""And I would like to give you a few figures about the different recycling that we have in Europe."",
  ""So, you can see on the graph that construction and demolition waste represent 30%, 37% of the total volume of waste, which is recycling in Europe."",
  ""And on top of that, you can have the second one, which is So in total, these two sub-segment that we consider the same in vibration, which is because it's the same player, the same type of equipment, the same customer, I would say, and partners."",
  ""All of this construction and demolition waste recycling in volume represent 56% of the total volume of waste, which is recycled In the Recycling segment, our own equipment perform four types of function."",
  ""The first one is to solve by size."",
  ""Sorting is very important in Recycling."",
  ""So, we can – our equipment can sort by size, the waste."",
  ""They can sort by density the waste."",
  ""And the third function in that, we can make equipment, which are able to feed in the right way or the type of sorter."",
  ""For instance, optical sorter or magnetic sorter that needs to be fed in the right way and vibration can do that."",
  ""And the last function is to wash and scrub the waste by – with the use of water."",
  ""So on this slide on your screen, you can see a typical plant for recycling of construction and demolition waste."",
  ""The input is made on the left part of the plant and the output are the pile of stone."",
  ""When I say stone, I mean it could be stone, but it could be block of concrete or bricks or what you can imagine."",
  ""So it means something similar in size to stones."",
  ""And you can see pile of stones."",
  ""And as well on the bottom of the plant, you can see some pile of sand and some mud as well, which are the product which are going to be sold to other customers, to customer of our customer."",
  ""So, we cannot supply all of the equipment of this plant."",
  ""But actually, this plant is made in two different plants, one on the bottom and one on the top."",
  ""On the top, it's more a plant to process stones, and in the bottom, a small plant to process sand and mud."",
  ""And we have the right equipment."",
  ""We have all of the equipment, which are needed, more or less."",
  ""The main equipment to be used in this first plant, which possesses stone."",
  ""So what we do here is that we sort equipment by size and we wash and scrub all of the waste."",
  ""And these equipment, the vibrating So it's only to show you our capacity, our ability to leverage, our experience that we have in That's all for me."",
  ""I'll let you take over, Thomas for the rest....this week."",
  ""My name is Rasmus Køjborg, and I have the pleasure of welcoming CEO of SKAKO, that's Lionel Girieud."",
  ""And we also have CFO of SKAKO, that's Thomas Pedersen."",
  ""They promised to take us through the quarterly numbers here and sort of the highlights."",
  ""So a warm welcome to you two."",
  ""And before I hand over, I'll also give a warm welcome to those of you who signed up for today's presentation."",
  ""We already got a good number of questions."",
  ""But should you have any questions, please pass them on in the chat room and then make sure we will do a round of Q&A after the presentation."",
  ""And of course, we'll record the presentation and But with that, I'll leave it to you, Lionel and Thomas."",
  ""And as always, I will start and then Lionel will take over."",
  ""We have, as we used to have, the normal disclaimer on this presentation, and then we have an agenda where we start with the SKAKO at a glance."",
  ""Then we have the quarterly report."",
  ""Then, Lionel will go a little deeper down to the SKAKO business, and then we will finalize with our new guidance, which were updated Friday last week."",
  ""And of course, we will end up with an Q&A session."",
  ""So – and if we start with SKAKO at a glance, then nothing or almost nothing has changed since the last HC Andersen."",
  ""We are still in six countries with subsidiaries to the SKAKO, the listed company."",
  ""We have approximately 133 employees worldwide."",
  ""We have headquarter in Faaborg and production in Strasbourg and San Sebastian."",
  ""We have now above 2,000 shareholders, 2,004 shareholders, 94% is in Denmark."",
  ""And then if we look at board of directors and management, they hold 33% of the share capital."",
  ""Then if we jump into the quarterly report, then we can see that we have done okay during this quarter, especially our Recycling business has been growing 7% in revenue."",
  ""And that is also leading up to the strategy that we have that we expect the Recycling business to grow more than the other two customer segments that we have."",
  ""Then what we also can see is that during this quarter, aftersales increased by 24.6% in the Then when we look at the figures, then we can see that revenue in total decreased in the current quarter and it is mainly driven by Minerals, which decreased approximately 19%."",
  ""But we expect Minerals to get back on track in Q4."",
  ""And as you may be all of you know, we received the huge and the largest order in vibration business, in vibration history, above DKK 150 million from OCP, and that will be delivered in 2025 and 2026."",
  ""So that gives us a good outlook for the coming years."",
  ""And if we look at the order backlog that we have right now, DKK 213 million, that is a growth on 195%."",
  ""And if we look at the plant sales revenue that we normally have, then it covers all of the revenue for 2025, if you do a mathematic calculation on the order backlog."",
  ""So that gives us a good outlook going forward."",
  ""Then if we try to jump into – to the figures, then one of the things that we want to highlight is actually even though that we have a decrease in the revenue, then we will maintain the EBIT guidance for the year between DKK 24 million to DKK 28 million."",
  ""We now expect it to be in the lower end and that is, of course, based by the revenue decrease that we have seen."",
  ""But still, we've maintained the EBIT guidance, so that is a positive message to the shareholders."",
  ""Then even though that Minerals is decreasing during this quarter, then we still see a lot of quotations and a lot of request from our customers."",
  ""They are just a little hesitant in making the decisions and that is also one of the things that we are seeing in the other customer segments."",
  ""But we feel comfortable about having this EBIT guidance for the whole year."",
  ""Then as you also can see here, revenue decreased by 7.6%."",
  ""And that, of course, influenced on the gross profit, which decreased by DKK 1.7 million to DKK 16.3 million."",
  ""And then, it has the – also an impact on operating profit, of course."",
  ""And then if we go between gross profit and the EBIT, then we in the current quarter have also hired two new sales guys to fulfill the future growth that we expect in the company."",
  ""So that, of course also impacts the capacity cost."",
  ""So – and order backlog, as I mentioned, 195% up to DKK 213 million order intake and backlog, of course, in this quarter influenced by the large order to OCP of more than DKK 150 million."",
  ""Then if we look at the key figures, key ratios, then we can see that we have an increase in our assets."",
  ""Net debt has also increased a little bit or 25%."",
  ""So that's not a little bit."",
  ""But given the numbers that are so small, then due to the fact that net working capital also during this quarter has increased, then it has the influence of the net debt."",
  ""But what we see in Q4 is a significant positive cash flow and it is driven by primarily the prepayment from the large order from OCP."",
  ""So, we expect a significant positive cash flow in Q4."",
  ""And that will, of course, also impact the net debt and also net working capital."",
  ""Then if we look at net debt to EBITDA ending at 1.2, it is higher than the same period last year, but still significant below our expectations on 2.5."",
  ""So that gives us a possibility to follow our strategy of growing the business."",
  ""And also, if we look into some acquisitions, we have the possibility to – also to acquire those and, of course, continuously payout the dividend as we have done in the past years."",
  ""And with those highlights for the quarter, then I will hand over to Lionel."",
  ""Thomas, I'm afraid, you're muted now."",
  ""The last slide that we have for today's presentation is the guidance."",
  ""As you all know, we came out with new guidance Friday last week, where we maintained our operating profit to the level between DKK 24 million to DKK 28 million, but of course, due to the growth that we had in revenue, then we are now in the lower part of the interim."",
  ""Then we decreased the revenue to minus 2% to 1% where it was previously 2% to 5%, and that is driven by the activity that we see in the construction industry in Europe, where we can see that it has slowed down and therefore, we have in this period also allocated our focus to the other areas, especially trying to use our effort in Recycling, which still is growing."",
  ""And also in the Minerals business, where we have this huge order from OCP that we are using a lot of effort to process and have progress as fast as possible, of course."",
  ""So given the low activity in the industry in Europe, then we are satisfied that we can still maintain our EBIT guidance."",
  ""So that was all from me.""
]","[
  ""It will be a – it's a bit difficult to answer, but for sure, there will be an impact next year with this very, very large order."",
  ""And the revenue that we will be able to have during the quarter will be vary depending on the work in progress that we will have on this order."",
  ""It is not only depending on our capacity to produce, it's how well – it as well depending on the customer side."",
  ""It means to be able to deliver according to what the customer wants to have For sure."",
  ""Getting this type of order is a very strong reference."",
  ""And you know, especially mineral is a very conservative industry."",
  ""So as long as you have good reference, you will get orders."",
  ""So order will mean, I would say, order, order for sure."",
  ""So we do not produce on the US market and we are – only deliver equipment."",
  ""So – but we have not yet received any bad signal from this market."",
  ""We are only developing the fastener market in the US and we are delivering to this market very specific product."",
  ""And I would say that the number of US competitor for this segment that we are developing in the US are – is very small."",
  ""So we are not concerned about that so far, but No, I think it's final product for our customer."",
  ""After that, you can see the pile of stone that you can see on the sketch."",
  ""They are definitively sent to build roads or build directly, ."",
  ""Very good, Thomas and Lionel."",
  ""And yes, let's jump on to some questions."",
  ""There's a good number of questions here."",
  ""So, actually, being on this slide, there's the first question that came in here."",
  ""In order to reach the low point of your guidance, SKAKO must And I can answer that question."",
  ""Our guidance on revenue is, as you mentioned, decreased, but it is minus 2% to 1%."",
  ""So that gives us an estimated revenue in Q4 on approximately DKK 66 million to DKK 73 million."",
  ""Year-on-year, if we look at the low interval, then it's correct, it's equal to fourth quarter last year, which were also at DKK 66 million."",
  ""So year-on-year, if we And then as you probably also have seen, if you look at the historical figures, then Q4 is normally a strong quarter for SKAKO."",
  ""And that is also what we are looking into with the pipeline order backlog, the activities that we see in the market and so on."",
  ""So, we expect a strong fourth quarter."",
  ""And of course, given that we need to deliver DKK 10 million in EBIT, that is – then we Okay."",
  ""And a follow-up on that because there's someone asking here, what kind of preparations are you doing here in the last half of 2024 for the large mineral order?"",
  ""Are you mainly occurring costs and no revenue on the order here in 2024?"",
  ""I think you said when you announced the order that it would have a limited impact here on 2024, but also got the understanding that you have started a little bit of the sort of the preparations for this order to be ready for 2025 and 2024."",
  ""So I guess that must be on the cost side."",
  ""Could you elaborate a bit on that?"",
  ""Yeah, we could elaborate on that."",
  ""And due to the way that we recognize our revenue, then we have the work in progress."",
  ""And of course, due to the fact that, like we also mentioned in the quarterly report, then given that Minerals has been decreasing this current quarter, then we have refocused a little bit and then we do whatever we can, of course, to focus on this OCP order and also Good."",
  ""And also in relation to this, as you said, Thomas, the Q4 can usually be strong on – particularly on the earnings side."",
  ""There was a question here that SKAKO's quarter results are known to have some degree of seasonality."",
  ""Given the last order from OCP, will this seasonality in the result be less in 2025, do you think?"",
  ""And also in relation to this, there's actually two question that goes on this."",
  ""If you could give sort of some color on the distribution or the split up of the revenue for this order between 2025 and 2026."",
  ""But I think you mentioned something about the order of completion that you're doing, Thomas, right."",
  ""So I guess it will depend on how the completion is progressing."",
  ""And it's also, as Lionel mentioned, then, we are also depending on other suppliers for OCP and also the preparation of OCP in general."",
  ""So even though that we have some kind of control, then we also influenced by other sub-suppliers and OCP."",
  ""And then also maybe I should flip a little bit on the slides here, I think, too."",
  ""There was a question also relating to the order backlog here."",
  ""As we can see, it was the DKK 212.7 million after the Q3."",
  ""And there was a question relating to, if the full DKK 150 million amount from the Morocco OCP And that is correct."",
  ""It is included in that amount."",
  ""And then, it also – people are also looking at sort of the perspectives of this."",
  ""There's someone asking here, if you believe you can get more orders from the customer in Morocco."",
  ""And also another question here."",
  ""Let me just see, does waiting a large order in Minerals make it easier to Very good."",
  ""And then there was also a question to – let me see if I can find it here."",
  ""Yeah, as you mentioned, Thomas, down here you have the net debt to EBITDA."",
  ""It is currently at 1.2 and you have a goal of being below 2.5."",
  ""There was actually a question if sort of – with sort of the state of the general industry in Europe, do we see sort of any M&A opportunities within your segments?"",
  ""We always are looking at the market in general."",
  ""And of course, if we look at our ambitions onto 2028, then we expect to double our Recycling business by end of 2028."",
  ""So – and that is organic-wise, but all the time due to the fact that we want to be a main player on this market."",
  ""And of course, also in the other sub-segments, then we are looking into the European market to see if we can have some acquisitions."",
  ""But that is something that we have done since we also took over Very good."",
  ""And then also a question referring to the presidential election in the US and the outcome here."",
  ""So if you have gotten any feedback from customers with respect to Trump becoming the President now and the impact of potential tariffs."",
  ""If this may negatively affect your European customers or may it create business opportunities actually in the US?"",
  ""And if yes, could you elaborate a bit on these risks and the opportunities that may be the outcome of this?"",
  ""And then we can maybe also mention that in 2023, the revenue for the US market was below 2 percentage of our total revenue."",
  ""So it is not a huge revenue that we have at that market."",
  ""And I think we are through most of the questions."",
  ""There was one final here."",
  ""So there was a question here, and I turn to this slide that you went through, Lionel that what happens next in the value chain with the different kind of waste that's been separated and sorted?"",
  ""And are you anyhow involved in sort of like further up the value chain with your equipment?"",
  ""We will conclude by that."",
  "" very much, Lionel and Thomas, for participating here today and giving you – giving us the rundown of the Q3 report."",
  "" to those of you who listened in and there are some very good questions."",
  ""I'll just wish you all a nice day from here.""

  ""The third quarter marked a significant turning point for Kirkland's as we entered into a strategic partnership with Beyond that allowed us to retire expensive debt, strengthen our balance sheet and begin to position our company for growth."",
  ""This partnership not only provides us with additional capital to continue progressing on our Kirkland's home initiatives, but enables new growth opportunities as we work together to revitalize the Bed Bath & Beyond brand."",
  ""In addition to this important milestone, during the quarter, we anniversaried the strategic shift in our Kirkland's Home brand that we began to implement in September of last year."",
  ""Going forward, our results will be much more comparable to prior year periods as we continue the brand revitalization."",
  ""Before I share more on our strategic initiatives, let me review a few highlights from the quarter."",
  ""I am very pleased with our team's ability to deliver our fourth consecutive quarter of positive, comparable store sales growth of 1.6%, driven by positive traffic and conversion despite a significant headwind from Hurricanes Helene and Milton."",
  ""In line with prior quarter trends, the strength in our store performance continued to be offset by declines in our e-commerce channel, resulting in a total comparable sales decline of 3% for the period."",
  ""With respect to profitability, we delivered a year-over-year $3.7 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA, resulting in a return to positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter."",
  ""While we have continued to see our customer be choiceful in her spend, which has increased promotional activity across the industry, we were pleased to see a 6% increase in transactions and 10% increase in units sold driven by continued positive momentum in seasonally relevant décor such as holiday, floral and gift."",
  ""Our overall third quarter performance is a great example of our team's ability to deliver year-over-year improved financial performance."",
  ""While navigating the necessity to operate with a conservative approach to cash management which impacted our marketing budgets and timing of product flow in the quarter."",
  ""This accomplishment reinforces our optimism for the future, given the healthier financial position we expect to be in following the completion of the Beyond transaction, allowing us to begin to build the foundation for new growth."",
  ""Now, let me turn to the ongoing progress we are making on our Kirkland's Home strategic initiatives and how we see the Beyond partnership further supporting our efforts and growth potential."",
  ""First, with respect to and re-engaging our core customer, we spent the first half of the year diligently focused on reactivating lapsed customers, enhancing their loyalty profiles, and keeping them engaged with the brand."",
  ""These efforts are paying off, as we have seen a 39% reactivation of lapsed customers over the last 12 months."",
  ""We have continued to grow our loyalty file and we have continued to drive high engagement with our over 3 million social media followers, particularly when we feature an in-store shopping experience."",
  ""While our marketing budget is lean, given our strategically conservative approach to expenses, we continue to focus on impact and efficiency by driving traffic through seasonally relevant events that align to our new product launches and continued to drive conversion through targeted email and SMS campaigns."",
  ""Looking ahead, as our financial position improves and we begin to leverage Beyond's robust customer database, we believe we have a greater opportunity to more effectively engage with our customers and more efficiently acquire new customers."",
  ""In addition, we believe in the opportunity to further expand customer loyalty and retention through unified loyalty and credit programs with Beyond."",
  ""Let me now turn to our next initiative, refocusing our product assortment."",
  ""As I mentioned, we are now a year into executing on this initiative, leaning into our Always Something New mindset by delivering more frequent newness in the key categories that our customers expect and love."",
  ""We continue to see excellent results in holiday, floral, gift, fragrance and textiles."",
  ""And while we are pleased with the results across our décor categories, we saw continued softness in furniture and wall décor driven by both macroeconomic pressures to high-ticket goods and the strategic decision to ship goods in these categories later to minimize the impact from the spike in container cost and limited availability of containers over the summer."",
  ""As we shared last quarter, we have seen a strong start to our Halloween and harvest assortment, and we were pleased to end the season exceeding our expectations in both revenue and margin."",
  ""The reintroduction of gift continues to resonate with our customers, largely driven by apparel, accessories and impulse product."",
  ""Our carry-all tote and monogram jewelry boxes continue to be the top items in this category."",
  ""These category trends remain strong as we look at early holiday sales and see newness and Christmas and gift continuing to drive demand."",
  ""We also anticipate being in a more favorable inventory position in furniture and wall décor as we move into December."",
  ""Our merchants have worked diligently to bring value price points back to the higher ticket categories, and we believe those efforts will help improve conversion in these categories as we move forward."",
  ""In addition to our own initiatives around our product assortment, we are also excited to leverage our partnership with Beyond to expand our distribution channels and more efficiently move slower turning product via overstock.com."",
  ""We believe, in time, these efforts combined with continuing to drive newness and freshness across the assortment, will further support improved inventory turns more in line with our historical performance."",
  ""This now leads me to our final strategic initiative, strengthening our omni-channel capabilities."",
  ""With respect to e-commerce, while performance remains challenged, our teams are actively working to drive improvements."",
  ""As we discussed last quarter, we had recently implemented a new pricing tool to help our merchants better analyze the competition, particularly in our dropship assortments."",
  ""Within the quarter, we deployed two major pricing tests in art and furniture, and the findings have provided us clear direction for pricing and the technology needed to best showcase value for the customer that we plan to incorporate into our strategy for the upcoming e-commerce re-platform."",
  ""As we focus on developing our roadmap to our re-platforming efforts next year, we are thrilled to leverage the e-commerce expertise of Beyond."",
  ""We are reviewing our current technology and our recent RFP process with our partners at Beyond, with the goal of making a platform decision by the end of the year."",
  ""With stronger e-commerce capabilities in place, we expect to better leverage our omni-channel model as we remain highly encouraged with the continued strength of our brick-and-mortar channel."",
  ""It is a testament to our store teams that through our partnership with Beyond, we will be the exclusive brick-and-mortar licensee and lead the efforts to revitalize the iconic Bed Bath & Beyond brand."",
  ""As we discussed at our announcement, we are planning to open our initial Bed Bath & Beyond neighborhood stores in 2025."",
  ""We expect these stores to generate at least 2 times the revenue of the current average Kirkland's home store and will focus on a curated assortment of Bed Bath & Beyond iconic legacy brands, as well as complementary Kirkland's Home seasonal and décor products."",
  ""We recently reorganized our team to support both brands and are actively building the Bed Bath & Beyond merchandising and store strategy."",
  ""There is still a lot of work to be done as we prepare for our first opening next year, but both of our teams are excited for the growth opportunity we see ahead for this strategy as we position Kirkland's as a multi-brand retailer."",
  ""In summary, we are pleased with the progress we are making across our business."",
  ""Our partnership with Beyond has further energized our teams and our efforts and positioning Kirkland's to achieve its full potential."",
  ""We remain excited about what we can achieve together as we look to end fiscal 2024 in a healthier financial position with significant opportunities for growth."",
  ""And now, over to Mike."",
  ""We are proud of the results we have continued to deliver throughout this year despite the challenges we have faced."",
  ""This year is a transformative year for Kirkland's."",
  ""We entered the year as a single banner retailer in the midst of a turnaround and we are exiting the year as a dual brand retailer with significantly more growth opportunities, along with an improved balance sheet and ongoing traction against our initiatives."",
  ""As we look ahead to 2025, we are excited to unlock the potential of our partnership with Beyond, as we revitalize the Bed Bath & Beyond brand, further strengthen the Kirkland's Home Foundation and begin to reinvest in areas like technology and marketing."",
  ""Before I close, I want to thank our teams."",
  ""None of our accomplishments would be possible without our team members who show up focused on our customer every day."",
  ""Their dedication to the art and science of retail is crucial and delivering the experience our customers love."",
  ""We are excited by the opportunities for growth and are committed to delivering value to our shareholders."",
  ""That is our focus now and will continue to be in 2025 and beyond."",
  ""That concludes our prepared remarks."",
  ""Except for historical information discussed during this conference call, the statements made by company management are forward-looking and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which may cause Kirkland's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results."",
  ""Those risks and uncertainties are more fully described in Kirkland's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."",
  ""A webcast replay will also be available via the link provided in today's press release, as well as on the company's website at kirklands.com."",
  ""Now, I will turn the call over to Kirkland's CEO, Amy Sullivan."",
  ""For the third quarter, net sales were $114.4 million versus $116.4 million in the prior year quarter."",
  ""As a reminder, we had anticipated that the calendar shift associated with last year's 53-week year would benefit total sales dollars in the third quarter as a smaller week at the beginning of the quarter was replaced by a larger week pulled into the end of the quarter."",
  ""This shift benefited sales by approximately $3 million in the third quarter."",
  ""In addition to this shift, the total sales comparison incorporated the 4% decline in average store count compared to the prior year quarter, and a comparable sales decrease of 3% for the quarter."",
  ""The decrease in comparable sales, which is calculated on a like-for-like basis by shifting the prior year NRF calendar by one week was driven by declines in the consolidated average ticket and e-commerce conversion, partially offset by an increase in consolidated traffic and store conversion."",
  ""We estimate that Hurricanes Helene and Milton negatively impacted our comparable sales performance by approximately 100 basis points."",
  ""For the quarter, comparable store sales increased 1.6%, inclusive of the disruption from the hurricanes, which impacted about 20% of our store base in some fashion."",
  ""With respect to our e-commerce business, sales declined 14.9% compared to the prior year period, offsetting the positive results in our store channel."",
  ""E-commerce accounted for 24% of total sales in the quarter, down from 28% in the prior year quarter."",
  ""Breaking down sales within the quarter, comps were down 3% in August, down 1.3% in September, and down 5.2% in October."",
  ""October reflected a more difficult year-over-year comparison and included the impact of the hurricanes and the inventory flow adjustments that Amy discussed."",
  ""From a merchandise perspective, we saw increases versus the prior year in holiday, gift, textiles, floral fragrance and housewares, reflecting our shift in emphasis to faster turning lower price point items."",
  ""However, these increases were not enough to offset declines in the higher ticket categories of furniture, mirrors, wall décor, art, and lamps."",
  ""Geographically speaking, sales performance lagged in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina due to the impact of the storms while we saw strong performance in Texas and other areas of the Southeast."",
  ""Gross profit margin increased 180 basis points to 28.1% of sales, compared to 26.3% in the prior year quarter."",
  ""The components of this year-over-year change were as follows."",
  ""Central distribution costs decreased by 130 basis points to 4.8%, primarily due to a later inventory build-up versus the prior year."",
  ""The closure of our Winchester, Virginia e-commerce hub in the prior year quarter also contributed to the decline compared to the prior years."",
  ""Outbound freight costs, including both store and e-commerce shipping expenses decreased 120 basis points to 6.8% of sales compared to the prior year quarter."",
  ""Improved management of outbound store routes along with lower rates per route were the primary drivers of the decrease."",
  ""We also benefited from lower parcel delivery costs due to the reduction in e-commerce revenue and lower contract parcel rates."",
  ""In addition to these cost improvements, depreciation included in cost of sales decreased by about 20 basis points to 1.3% of sales."",
  ""Partially offsetting these factors was a decline in merchandise margin and an increase in store occupancy costs."",
  ""Compared to the prior year, merchandise margin decreased approximately 50 basis points to 53.5%, and store occupancy cost increased 40 basis points to 12.5%."",
  ""The decrease in merchandise margin was largely driven by increased promotional activity during the periods, particularly in the latter part of the quarter."",
  ""And the pressure that we expected to experience from freight was minimized in the quarter due to our strategic decision to ship certain goods later than we previously planned."",
  ""The deleverage of store occupancy cost was largely due to the overall sales decline in the quarter."",
  ""Total operating expenses decreased $2.8 million to $34.5 million, or 30.2% of sales, compared to $37.3 million, or 32% of sales, in the prior year quarter."",
  ""The decrease in dollars was primarily the result of reduced advertising costs, corporate salaries, and asset impairment expenses."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA, which excludes certain expenses related to the Beyond transaction, stock compensation and severance charges, was a positive $0.5 million versus negative $3.3 million in the prior year quarter."",
  ""Operating loss was $2.4 million compared to an operating loss of $6.7 million last year."",
  ""Excluding the items I reviewed in adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating loss was $1.9 million compared to $6 million last year."",
  ""Interest expense in the quarter was $1.7 million compared to $1.2 million in the prior year quarter due to higher borrowing levels and higher interest rates."",
  ""During the quarter, we incurred a charge of $3.3 million related to the repayment of our FILO term loan in conjunction with our transaction with Beyond."",
  ""Net loss was $7.7 million compared to $6.4 million in the prior year quarter."",
  ""Excluding the non-core operating items incurred in both periods, adjusted net loss was $3.8 million compared to $5.9 million in the prior year quarter."",
  ""With respect to our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $111 million in inventory, a 5.7% increase from the $105.2 million at the end of the prior year quarter."",
  ""The year-over-year increase was largely due to timing."",
  ""Due to the calendar shift, we were one week deeper into the season as compared to last year, and we also strategically prioritized our inventory flow to better manage the container availability and freight costs previously discussed."",
  ""We had total borrowings outstanding of $80.4 million at the end of the quarter, which was comprised of $65 million under our senior revolving line of credit and $15.4 million in debt to Beyond related to the term loan, convertible term loan, and the sale of a percentage of Kirkland's future revenues to Beyond net of debt issuance and original issue discount costs."",
  ""This compares to $52.7 million under our senior revolving line of credit and $8.7 million under our prior FILO term loan net of debt issue costs at the end of the previous quarter."",
  ""The increase in borrowings reflects the net loss for the quarter, seasonal growth in working capital and capital expenditures of $0.5 million."",
  ""We are continuing our policy of not providing specific guidance given the difficulty in forecasting visibility."",
  ""However, we do want to provide some color around our expectations in key areas."",
  ""First, as a reminder, this year's fiscal calendar includes 52 weeks compared to last year's 53-week fiscal calendar."",
  ""This extra week last year resulted in approximately $6.6 million in revenue that we will not benefit from this year."",
  ""In addition, the timing shift associated with the 53rd week will negatively impact Q4 as a larger week at the beginning of the quarter will be replaced by a smaller week at the end, resulting in a headwind of approximately $3 million for the quarter."",
  ""We've seen a slower start to Q4, but we are encouraged by the sell-through, we are seeing in key categories such as holiday and gifts, and we expect our in-stock levels in furniture to improve from earlier this fall."",
  ""We also believe that the slower start is driven in part by the calendar shift and the compressed holiday selling season we have this year."",
  ""Using history as a guide, we have been analyzing the sales build and consumer behavior we saw in 2019, which is the last time we had a similar retail calendar."",
  ""While consumer behavior has certainly changed since that pre-pandemic year, the overall analysis suggests that the compressed shopping calendar would benefit December versus November."",
  ""Thus, we remain cautiously optimistic as we move forward through the quarter."",
  ""We expect the promotional environment to continue to be a factor in Q4, and we also expect to see some added margin pressure from the spike in inbound freight rates we experienced in the summer as the affected goods sell through."",
  ""However, the actions we took to control shipments will limit the amount of that pressure versus our original expectations."",
  ""As for operating expenses, we continue to manage them very tightly and expect to continue to benefit from the cost reduction actions we took earlier this year."",
  ""While we believe we continue to have a line of sight to achieving positive adjusted EBITDA for the year, we acknowledge that the promotional environment has intensified as reflected in our results today and our expectations for the fourth quarter."",
  ""With that said, we are continuing to control the aspects of the business that we can control and our priorities are unchanged."",
  ""We are confident in our ability to drive strong year-over-year improvement in profitability and enter 2025 under stronger footing."",
  ""We continue to believe in the long-term opportunities still ahead, especially as we layer in our strategic partnership with Beyond."",
  ""We believe through our transaction with Beyond, we have the potential to accelerate the timeline to achieve our long-term targeted margins and growth guidance."",
  ""We look forward to sharing more details on our plans, on our future calls."",
  ""I will now turn the call back over to Amy for a few closing remarks before we open the call up for questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking the questions and congrats on the strategic partnership."",
  ""I wanted to start by coming back to the commentary around trends and see if we can get a little more color in terms of what you're seeing,."",
  ""You noted a little bit softer results here in November, but wanted to understand, if you could help us with kind of magnitude."",
  ""And then also kind of the split that you're expecting in terms of e-commerce performance, which it's lapping kind of similar compares in Q4 versus Q3 versus your retail store sales, which saw a pretty meaningful improvement last year."",
  ""And just clearly a tougher compare."",
  ""And then shifting gears here to talking about the Beyond partnership, as we head into 2025, it sounds like that really starts in earnest in Q1."",
  ""And wanted to get a sense for how you think that's going to evolve, particularly your e-commerce business and the potential there."",
  ""There's, obviously some aspects to that agreement in which you're paying fees and incentive fees for success there."",
  ""But also wanted to understand how it might impact your marketing budget and how those costs may be shared across the two parties?"",
  ""Let me see if I can get a little bit more granular there on, in terms of thinking about the costs, right, as you're getting into a venture like this and kind of taking your respective customer bases and helping them to understand the changes that are happening here, would you expect a greater investment to be made by Kirkland's in kind of getting this kickstarted next year?"",
  ""And then just one other quick one here from me."",
  ""In terms of what you're seeing from a kind of promotional environment out there."",
  ""I think that the category as a whole has probably been somewhat neutral year-over-year."",
  ""But I wanted to get your insight in terms of what you're seeing from your closest competitors in whether or not there are particular categories, you noted kind of the disparity in performance among categories, but whether or not you're seeing some more aggressive promos in particular categories?"",
  "" for taking the questions and best wishes."",
  ""I'll start and then I'll let Mike give some additional color."",
  ""So, from an overall start to the season perspective, as you know, Q4 is our holiday season."",
  ""And so, when you take into account the calendar shift, we're really managing to this nine-week spread between November and December."",
  ""So, there's a lot of noise in the month of November in terms of how the calendar shift plays out."",
  ""Mike alluded in his part of the script that if you use history as a comparison and look at 2019, and the rate of sales that we expect to have in at this point of the season, it still gets us optimism that November and December combined will be what we need it to be."",
  ""So, we're really looking into – the next two weeks are really important for us."",
  ""We have a huge customer appreciation event going on right now."",
  ""And as we wind into December, we believe those nine weeks combined will shake out."",
  ""So, from an e-commerce perspective, we, as you know, throughout this past year have been really focused on evaluating our technology."",
  ""We've gone through a pretty robust RFP process to start to identify the re-platforming choices that we need to make, given that our inherent strength here is brick-and-mortar and theirs is e-commerce, we've paused just to bring their expertise to the table with us as we make those final decisions on the re-platform."",
  ""So, when I think about how we leverage them as we cross into the new year, it would really be taking their guidance in terms of those next steps and our decision for building out our roadmap, and leaning into them as we think about are there other partners or other players in the technology space that we should be evaluating as we look at our data tech stack and negotiate alongside of them from an economies of scale perspective, just to open up more options to make sure that when we do invest in technology, we've made the best decision for the long haul."",
  ""So, we're actively working through that right now."",
  ""We expect to make our final re-platform decision by the end of this calendar year, and then other components of technology that we think enhance the total business."",
  ""We will continue to have those conversations as we move into the start of the new year."",
  ""And then, from a marketing perspective, I would say it's sort of twofold."",
  ""And so, obviously our goal, both Kirkland's and Beyond, is to get a benefit of pooling our customer data and how can we not only learn customer shopping behavior by having the data pooled together, but how can we also share in a potential future unified loyalty program, unified credit card program?"",
  ""And so, we are in the very early phases of that and obviously working through sharing that data, ensuring that we're giving our customers the opportunity to opt into that and working with our legal teams on all the privacy laws."",
  ""But we definitely believe that there's significant upside when you think about the opportunity for Kirkland's to get new customers into the file at a much more efficient cost by sharing in the much larger pool of customers that Beyond has across its multitude of brands."",
  ""I would say, overall, we've been able to control sort of what we expected the promotional cadence to be."",
  ""I would say it's more about consistency of promo and ensuring that there's sort of always a new fresh deal for our customer to keep traffic and conversion where we need it to be from an ongoing perspective."",
  ""There have been parts of our business and more seasonally relevant décor side of things, and we specifically mentioned on this call Halloween and Harvest where we were able to get better read price selling at the beginning of the season, and close out that season a little better than, than we had in prior years."",
  ""If you think about the higher ticket categories, though, I would say it is just sort of a continuation of what we've seen in terms of the pressure on those high-ticket goods."",
  ""The good news for us is we have then been very consistently focused on bringing in value engineered product within the high-ticket category."",
  ""So, as we move into the future months, we think that will start to balance."",
  ""But it's really just about getting that consistency of a value message and a promotional message out there to focus on traffic."",
  "" all for joining us today."",
  ""As a reminder, we are having our upcoming shareholder vote on December 23, which assuming a positive outcome, will solidify the full investment from Beyond, resulting in $8 million of additional liquidity by year end."",
  ""We look forward to speaking with you again on our next , and we hope everyone has a happy and healthy holiday season."",
  ""And Jeremy, in terms of the compares, I think we continue to see more momentum in the store side of the business."",
  ""I think that will continue into the fourth quarter, notwithstanding the tougher comps you called out as it relates to stores."",
  ""That's just the trend we've been on."",
  ""We've been seeing the traffic gains there, the conversion gains there, and that continues."",
  ""And Jeremy, one thing to add to that, just even with the fees related to the collaboration and the fees related to the incentive on the e-commerce side, when you look at it all together from where we were, cost of debt, if you will, versus where we are, it's neutral and it comes with these benefits."",
  ""So, we continue to be pleased that that's the case going into 2025."",
  ""We definitely would in terms of the store aspect of this."",
  ""I mean, we're going to operate these stores with our people, with our real estate efforts, our construction."",
  ""So, as we look at that, five stores to kind of plan for the pilot next year that will be an investment from – from us."",
  ""But we're getting that additional capital as we close this with the shareholder meeting coming up here on December 23."",
  ""That's when the final $8 million comes through, connected to the entire transaction."",
  ""And that will provide us that."",
  ""It's not a huge amount to get into these five stores, but it does provide us the ability to do that and some flexibility to do some other things across the business.""

  ""Welcome to Nuwellis third quarter 2024  call."",
  ""On today's call, I will provide an overview of our third quarter performance and give an update on our strategic initiatives."",
  ""Followed by Dr. Jefferies, our Chief Medical Officer, who will provide a summary of the recent publication on the efficacy of Nuwellis in a real-world community hospital setting."",
  ""Our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Scott, will then provide detailed commentary on our financial results before opening up the call for questions, followed by my closing remarks."",
  ""Nuwellis generated $2.4 million in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, a 2% decrease year-over-year."",
  ""However, sequentially, we grew 8% over Q2."",
  ""While the adult category of our business saw a lower volume of patients treated during the summer month, our pediatric customer category experienced a surge in revenue of 28% compared to the same quarter of last year, driven by three new pediatric accounts opened this quarter, including one of the largest hospital networks in Florida."",
  ""We also experienced a sequential improvement in pediatric For the remainder of our customer category, critical care and heart failure were down 25% and 36%, respectively on lower consumables utilization and console sales, reflecting the generally lower volume of patients treated during the summer months."",
  ""One of our key initiatives for the last three years have been to build our body of clinical evidence in order to make this therapy standard of care and get into the Medical Society guidelines."",
  ""In support of this initiative, I would like now to turn it over to Dr. Jefferies to discuss the latest addition to our growing body of clinical evidence and the impact that this clinical information may have in broad day to day clinical practice."",
  ""All participants will be in listen-only mode."",
  "" for joining today's conference call to discuss Nuwellis' corporate developments and financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024."",
  ""In addition to myself, with us today are Nestor Jaramillo, Nuwellis' President and CEO; Dr. John Jefferies, our Chief Medical Officer; as well as Rob Scott, our CFO."",
  ""At 8 AM Eastern time today, Nuwellis released financial results for the third quarter 2024."",
  ""If you have not received Nuwellis' , please visit the investors page on the company's website."",
  ""During today's call, the company will be making forward-looking statements."",
  ""All forward-looking statements made during today's call will be protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Any statements that relate to expectations or predictions of future events and market trends, as well as our estimated results or performance are forward-looking statements."",
  ""All forward-looking statements are based upon our current estimates and various assumptions."",
  ""These statements involve material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to materially differ from those anticipated or implied by these forward-looking statements."",
  ""All forward-looking statements are based upon current available information, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements."",
  ""Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these statements."",
  ""Please refer to the cautionary statements and discussion of risks in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the latest 10-K. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to Nestor."",
  ""In August, we announced the publication of a new study in current problems in cardiology, demonstrating the effectiveness of Aquadex in significantly reducing 60-day hospital readmission rates for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure who are otherwise resistant to diuretic treatment in a community hospital setting."",
  ""As a senior author on this paper, I was pleased to see the analysis of an Aquadex program in community based regional hospitals, showing how refractory acute decompensated heart failure patients benefited from significant volume loss and weight reduction, along with stable renal function and remarkable clinical benefit."",
  ""I would like to highlight that the outcomes of this community-based hospital setting trial demonstrate the broader applicability and effectiveness of the Aquadex therapy."",
  ""Real-world data in some ways is often more powerful than randomized controlled trials because it uses everyday patients that need to be treated rather than a cohort of pre-selected patients, which typically occurs as a certain group of academic institutions."",
  ""The outcome of this study shows that ultrafiltration can be very effective for these real-world types of patients."",
  ""This is vital for Nuwellis' strategy, as we now have the data to leverage as we expand the use of this therapy to these hospitals in a non-academic center setting."",
  ""Going deeper into the study's findings, it showed that favorable Aquadex therapy programs can result and achieved early as shown in this hospital system in the form of reduced, acute decompensated heart failure readmissions."",
  ""There are numerically fewer 30-day acute decompensated heart failure readmissions after Aquadex program initiation compared to pre-program initiation with a statistical p-value of 0.351."",
  ""However, at 60 days there were significantly fewer acute decompensated heart failure readmissions with a statistically significant p-value of 0.013."",
  ""Additionally, patients experienced significant volume reduction with a mean food loss of 9.4 liters and a significant weight loss with a mean decrease of 7.4 kilograms."",
  ""Notably, all 30 patients had stable renal function and no significant change in serum creatinine, a test used to measure kidney function at 72 hours of ultrafiltration therapy."",
  ""Finally, the study had important practical implications for heart failure clinics, demonstrating that a successful Aquadex program is reproducible and can be coordinated by general cardiologists without the need for a dedicated heart failure unit."",
  ""We continue to enroll patients in the REVERSE-HF trial, which is designed to help increase awareness and provide the data to support becoming standard of care."",
  ""The study has enrolled over one-third of the patients contemplated by the protocol."",
  ""I welcome any questions on this new evidence during the Q&A session."",
  ""And now I'd like to turn to Rob to discuss our third quarter financial results."",
  ""Turning to the Q3 financial results, revenue for the third quarter was $2.4 million, representing an 8% sequential growth and a 2% decline over the prior year period."",
  ""Our pediatric customer category surged with a 28% increase compared to a year ago as we expanded our Aquadex offerings to three new pediatric centers, one of which is within one of the largest hospital networks in Florida."",
  ""Our critical care and heart failure customer categories were down 25% and 36% year-over-year, respectively."",
  ""These declines are due to lower consumables utilization in the summer months and also because of console sales."",
  ""Gross margin was 70% for the third quarter compared to gross margin of 57.3% in the prior year quarter."",
  ""The margin improvement was primarily driven by higher manufacturing volumes of consumables and lower fixed overhead manufacturing expenses."",
  ""Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.7 million in the third quarter, a decrease of approximately 21% as compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The decrease in SG&A was primarily realized through efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023."",
  ""Third quarter research and development expense was $486,000, compared to $1.1 million in the prior year period."",
  ""The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to reduced consulting fees and compensation related expenses."",
  ""Total operating expenses were $3.2 million in the quarter, a decrease of approximately $1.4 million, or 30% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 as we continue to realize savings from operating efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023."",
  ""Operating loss in the third quarter was $1.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million in the prior year period, resulting in a $1.7 million period-over-period improvement."",
  ""Net income attributable to common shareholders in the third quarter was $2.4 million or a gain of a $1.74 per share compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $3.4 million or a loss of $63.27 per share for the same period in 2023."",
  ""Third quarter net income improvement was primarily the result of the revaluation of a prior period warrant liability resulting in a $3.9 million benefit."",
  ""We ended the third quarter with $1.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and with no debt on the balance sheet."",
  ""Our cash balance in the third quarter includes the August and July registered direct offerings priced at the market under Nasdaq rules As we previously disclosed, we mutually terminated our license and distribution agreement with SeaStar Medical, resulting in a settlement in October whereby they agreed to pay Nuwellis $900,000 by the end of the calendar year."",
  ""We received approximately $500,000 in the month of October."",
  ""This concludes our prepared remarks."",
  ""Operator, we would now like to open the call to questions.""

  ""I would like to ask you to walk us through an economic comparison of the now profitable given the heightened reimbursement, the now profitable way that hospitals can use Aquadex in the outpatient setting and the money they would make versus the money they would make doing ultrafiltration a different way for these same outpatients."",
  ""So you would see this totally replacing the inpatient population for those that don't have to be there for some other reason."",
  ""So then, I mean, is there any difference in actual outpatient medical benefit between these two procedures, meaning Aquadex versus some sort of dialysis machine they might use."",
  ""As long as the hospital can justify doing no harm, it's always going to make more money, if it can."",
  ""So then what's the crux of what All right."",
  ""Also, when can we expect the REVERSE-HF trial data?"",
  ""Sorry, I had concomitant calls."",
  ""So maybe you said something about timelines and enrollment percent already."",
  ""And if you did, would you please reiterate that?"",
  ""You mean – okay to the FDA you mean?"",
  ""And did you give an update for Vivian progress?"",
  ""So these new rates, which are substantially higher for Ultrafiltration go into effect 1/1/2025 correct?"",
  ""And how are you internally preparing the organization to capitalize on this in all three phases, right; pediatric, critical care and heart failure?"",
  ""Specifically, how are you addressing this with your customers?"",
  ""What's the go forward plan?"",
  ""Do you feel like at this point you have all the personnel you need in place or do you believe that with this higher reimbursement, you may hire a couple of either clinical people or salespeople to try to accelerate the adoption?"",
  ""I'll hop back in the queue."",
  ""This may take a little long, this explanation."",
  ""Right now, the only way that ultrafiltration is provided is in the inpatient and patients get hospitalized and it takes anywhere from three to five days to remove the fluid of these patients."",
  ""If you – and then the reimbursement is, there are three With this reimbursement now the hospitals can provide ultrafiltration in the outpatient setting."",
  ""It could be in an observation unit or even in the ER and the patient doesn't need to be admitted in the hospital."",
  ""Secondly, the reimbursement now is $1,639 per day, so if the patient needs three days to remove the fluid that the physician recommends, then it will be that amount every day."",
  ""So the hospital now, given our cost of the circuit, which is $900, the hospital can make $700 a day for treating these patients."",
  ""And again, the patient can take anywhere from three days treating the patient, coming in and out of the observation unit."",
  ""And so, therefore, the hospital will have more profits from the therapy."",
  ""It could replace admitting the patient in the hospital, decongesting the patient in the ER or in the observation unit, not needing to admit the patient in the ICU or in the hospital, therefore, will replace the inpatient treatment of using ultrafiltration."",
  ""We believe that treating patients with decompensated heart failure in the outpatient would be more profitable for the hospitals."",
  ""And I forgot to mention one other aspect of treating patients in the inpatient."",
  ""If the patient gets readmitted within 30 days, then the hospital doesn't get paid by CMS or most private payers and also, it assumes some penalties."",
  ""So that's another savings because the patient was not admitted."",
  ""In terms of the patient, the benefit to the patient, it is well documented that patients that get hospitalized, regardless of what is the condition, the mortality rate goes up."",
  ""So therefore, by not having to be admitted, you don't – are exposed to those high mortality rates."",
  ""In addition, the treatment would be anywhere from four to six hours and the patient – after that, the patient can just go home and then schedule the next visit."",
  ""So for the patient, it would be much better and also a better quality of life."",
  ""Yeah, Jonathan, that's a good question."",
  ""You know, and we have internally debated what were the reasons."",
  ""When we started the conversations with DaVita, we had a champion in that organization."",
  ""As soon as we signed the agreement, that champion got promoted and then we were assigned a different team."",
  ""So we lost a little bit of momentum there."",
  ""Also, at the beginning, we did not target the right centers."",
  ""We target centers that were very – that were good customers of Nuwellis and they were happy treating the patients by their staff in the inpatient."",
  ""They did not need the DaVita personnel."",
  ""So then we pivot and then we went to accounts that were familiar with ultrafiltration."",
  ""They had issues with capital budgets and personnel, and it just took a little too long for them to get ready to use ultrafiltration provided by DaVita."",
  ""At the at the current rate of enrollment, we expect to finished the enrollment period by the middle of 2026."",
  ""And then after that, there is a 90-day follow-up and then we would have the data analyzed and be ready to submit by the end of 2026."",
  ""Well, not to the FDA."",
  ""This is not a – I'm sorry, not to the FDA, to submit to publications ... And to submit to the medical societies for them to include this therapy in the guidelines, assuming and we expect the results to be very favorable."",
  ""Yes, we continue the development phase of Vivian and we're estimating that by the end of the 2025, we would be ready to start the in-human clinical study."",
  ""It would be an IDE trial."",
  ""That will be an FDA trial."",
  ""And we have already agreed on the protocol with the FDA."",
  ""Well, first of all, we're very excited about this new And also, they need to set up what is called the order sets."",
  ""And also, we're going to ensure that those hospitals in those territories do have coverage from either local CMS administrators and also private payers."",
  ""So we're getting ready on both helping the hospitals get set up, as well as making sure that the reimbursement is ready to be filed."",
  ""Right now, we have nine territories in place with sales reps and clinical specialists."",
  ""So we can start with those – in those territories."",
  ""Most of these hospitals that were doing ultrafiltration in the outpatient in the past, we haven't covered."",
  ""So we will not need to add anyone in the field to get started with the ultrafiltration in the outpatient."",
  ""We are going to look into bringing some expertise when it comes to reimbursement inside in the headquarters."",
  ""We continue to see momentum in our business with new accounts steadily opening on increasing awareness of the efficacy and supporting clinical evidence for all Aquadex ultrafiltration in the adult and pediatric customer categories."",
  ""We believe these clinical results, as described by Dr. Jefferies, will have a positive impact in growing our business and supporting Aquadex in becoming the standard of care for fluid removal when diuretics are ineffective."",
  ""As we reported early last week, we were pleased to announce the company received the notice of the – from the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services, also known as CMS, that the Aquadex Ultrafiltration Code will be reassigned to the outpatient reimbursement level, most consistent with the administration of ultrafiltration therapy and cost of treatment."",
  ""So effective January 1, 2025, the facility reimbursement fee will increase 297% from $413 to $1,639 per day."",
  ""With this increased reimbursement, we are opening a new chapter for Nuwellis."",
  ""We anticipate seeing accelerated top line growth from this rate increase."",
  ""As a point of clarification, the prior announcement reflected the reimbursement increase at 397%."",
  ""Additionally, as reported early last week, the company raised $5.1 million in gross proceeds from warrant exercises and through a warrant inducement solicitation."",
  ""I want to thank all the stakeholders, Nuwellis employees, stockholders, physicians, nurses and patients and healthcare workers in the field."",
  ""Without your support, we would not be able to achieve key advances in transforming the lives of patients suffering from fluid overload."",
  "" for your participation and support.""

  ""Despite sustained macroeconomic challenges and the charges recorded in Q3, we are encouraged by the sequential quarterly improvement in our core business profitability and by the results of our cost reduction efforts, which will be more fully realized beginning fourth quarter."",
  ""These improvements reflect our team's focus on managing controllables and reducing non-strategic costs in a difficult environment, while investing in impactful initiatives to expand our addressable market and growth opportunities, including our recently announced global licensing agreement with Margaritaville."",
  ""We're also encouraged by positive developments in the macroeconomic environment, such as cooling inflation and recent interest rate cuts in September and November, which should begin to increase demand for furnishings."",
  ""Our October High Point Market introductions were positively received with significant placements across the board."",
  ""In addition, we had the best retail placement market to date at outdoor furniture specialist, Sunset West."",
  ""The early feedback of three major casegoods collections for Hooker Branded gave us the confidence to place initial cuttings early before these groups were officially introduced in October."",
  ""As a result, the collections will ship this month, with a second cutting in January, increasing our speed to market by six months."",
  ""This puts us in a strong position for the coming fiscal year with our available product assortment."",
  ""In anticipation of increased demand and the typically stronger fall selling season, we built up Hooker Branded inventory by $11 million or 40% compared to previous quarter-end."",
  ""In addition, we are aggressively producing our top collections to ensure we will be in-stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2026."",
  ""These inventories are high-quality assortments centered on our best-selling and most profitable SKUs."",
  ""Now, I want to turn the discussion over to Paul, who will discuss highlights in each of our segments."",
  ""Over the last few months, the key economic indicators that impact furniture sales have been trending positively, such as interest rate cuts, which drive home mortgage rates and cooling inflation."",
  ""Additionally, in November, a leading real estate industry group stated its belief that the worst of the housing inventory shortage is ending, and forecasting approximately 10% increase in home sales for 2025, with mortgage rates stabilizing around 6%."",
  ""In October, year-over-year, furniture store sales rose for the second month in a row."",
  ""Lastly, consumer sentiment rose in November to its highest level since April, and the stock market continues near all-time highs."",
  ""While the macroeconomic outlook is improving, our team has continued to focus on the controllables and improvements already underway at Hooker Furnishings."",
  ""Our balance sheet, financial condition and management team should well equip us to navigate any remaining challenges as we focus on maximizing efficiencies with the cost reductions, while simultaneously investing in expansion strategies that will position us for revenue and profitability growth when demand fully returns."",
  ""This ends the formal part of our discussion."",
  ""And at this time, I will turn the call back over to our operator, Olivia, for questions."",
  ""Joining me this morning is Jeremy Hoff, our Chief Executive Officer."",
  ""We appreciate your participation today."",
  ""During our call, we may make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties."",
  ""A discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations is contained in our press release and SEC filing announcing our fiscal 2025 third quarter results."",
  ""Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today's call."",
  ""Our fiscal 2025 third quarter and nine-month results were adversely affected by the ongoing low demand in the home furnishings industry, as well as charges totaling about $7.5 million, including approximately $3.1 million of restructuring costs related to the company's previously announced cost savings plan, $2.4 million of bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy of a single large customer, and $2 million of non-cash impairment charges to certain trade names under the Home Meridian segment."",
  ""These factors resulted in an operating loss of $7.3 million and a consolidated net loss of $4.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the third quarter."",
  ""Consolidated net sales were $104 million, a decrease of $12.5 million or 10.7% compared to the same quarter of the previous year."",
  ""For the nine-month period, consolidated net sales were $293 million, a decrease of $43 million or 12.9% compared to the same period of the previous year."",
  ""This decrease was also due to low demand affecting the home furnishings industry and the absence of $11 million of liquidation sales from the unprofitable ACH product line, which the company exited last year."",
  ""The company reported a consolidated operating loss of $15 million and a net loss of $10.2 million or $0.97 per diluted share, attributed to lower overall sales, higher ocean freight costs at Hooker Branded, under-absorbed indirect costs at Domestic Upholstery, as well as the $7.5 million of charges mentioned earlier."",
  ""Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to comment on our fiscal 2025 third quarter results."",
  ""Beginning with Hooker Branded, net sales decreased by $4 million or 10.7% in the fiscal third quarter compared to the prior year period, due primarily to lower average selling prices."",
  ""While gross revenue in the segment decreased by 6.7% compared to the previous year's third quarter, discounts increased by 390 basis points, due mainly to higher discounting on excess inventories."",
  ""Unit volume decreased by a modest 2.1% compared to the previous year's third quarter but exceeded the first and second quarters of this fiscal year."",
  ""For the quarter, the segment reported an operating loss of $1.7 million on historically low third quarter net sales."",
  ""The result – this result included approximately $1 million of severance charges related to our cost reduction plan."",
  ""Incoming orders decreased by 13% year-over-year."",
  ""The quarter-end backlog was 30% lower than at the end of the prior year's third quarter, but remained 18% higher than pre-pandemic levels, which were at the end of fiscal 2020 third quarter."",
  ""For the nine-month period, net sales decreased by $14 million or 11.7%, also due primarily to lower average selling prices resulting from the price reductions implemented in the previous year in response to reduced ocean freight costs."",
  ""Unit volume was essentially flat, decreasing by about 1% compared to the prior year nine-month period."",
  ""Turning to the Home Meridian segment, net sales decreased by $5.1 million or 11.8% in the third quarter compared to the prior-year third quarter due to reduced unit volume."",
  ""Over 40% of the sales decrease was attributable to the loss of a major customer following its bankruptcy."",
  ""Sales through major furniture chains and independent furniture stores decreased, though these decreases were partially offset by an 8% increase in sales in our hospitality business, marking two consecutive quarters of higher revenues."",
  ""Incoming orders increased by 8% compared to the previous year's third quarter, while decreasing modestly by 2.9% for the nine-month period, despite the absence of orders from the discontinued ACH product line and the large customer bankruptcy."",
  ""Quarter-end backlog was 32% higher than the prior year third quarter backlog."",
  ""Despite increased net sales – decreased net sales, Home Meridian achieved a gross margin of 20.5%, its highest level since the acquisition in 2016."",
  ""The restructuring efforts at Home Meridian over the recent years have shown meaningful results to experience sustainable profitability, including significantly reduced allowances, improved product margins and lower fixed costs across nearly all of this segment."",
  ""For the quarter, the segment reported operating loss of $3.7 million, driven by $2.4 million in bad debt charges due to the previously mentioned customer bankruptcy, $2 million in non-cash intangible asset impairment charges, and $233,000 of severance costs related to the cost reduction plans."",
  ""For the nine-month period, net sales decreased by $19 million or 16%, in large part, due to the absence of $11 million in ACH liquidation sales, which accounted for approximately 60% of the sales decrease and 75% of the unit volume decrease."",
  ""Sales decreased in nearly all channels during the period, except for the hospitality business, which experienced a 23% increase."",
  ""Lastly, the Domestic Upholstery segment."",
  ""net sales decreased by $3.2 million or 10% compared to the prior year third quarter due to decreased sales at Shenandoah, Bradington-Young and HF Custom attributable to the persistent low demand."",
  ""This decrease was partially offset by a 9% increase in sales at Sunset West, which has delivered year-over-year quarterly sales growth for three consecutive quarters this fiscal year."",
  ""Gross profit decreased due to lower net sales, but the gross margin remained stable."",
  ""For the quarter, the segment reported an operating loss of $281,000, a sequential improvement compared to the $1.3 million in operating losses recorded in each of the fiscal 2025 first and second quarters."",
  ""This result also included approximately $560,000 of severance costs related to the cost reduction plan."",
  ""Incoming orders decreased by 4.8% during the quarter, and the quarter-end backlog was 30% lower than the prior year third quarter backlog."",
  ""Excluding Sunset West, the order backlog remained consistent with pre-pandemic levels at the end of the fiscal 2020 third quarter."",
  ""For the nine-month period, net sales decreased by $10.6 million or 10.8%, also due to decreased sales at Bradington-Young, Shenandoah and HF Custom, partially offset by a 10% increase in Sunset West net sales."",
  ""Turning now to cash, inventories and capital, cash and cash equivalents were $20.4 million at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of $22.7 million from the previous year-end in January."",
  ""Inventory levels increased by $4.7 million from year-end, driven primarily by a $6 million increase in Hooker Branded inventories."",
  ""During the nine-month period, we used cash and cash equivalents on hand to fund $7.4 million of dividends, $2.8 million to further develop our cloud-based ERP system, and $2.7 million in capital expenditures."",
  ""In addition to our cash balance, we have an aggregate of $28.3 million available under our existing revolver at quarter-end, and – as well as $29 million in cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance."",
  ""We expect to finalize the refinancing of our credit facility and pay off our term debt in the coming days."",
  ""As Jeremy mentioned, we're aggressively building inventory to support three new major casegoods collections, as well as our best selling and most profitable SKUs to accelerate speed-to-market and product availability for both current and next fiscal year."",
  ""The inventory build is also driven by what is expected to be a longer than typical Lunar New Year holiday in Vietnam, an expected longer post-holiday ramp-up period resulting from the extended holiday, and lower production demand in Vietnam, as well as the potential US East Coast port strike in January 2025."",
  ""Earlier this week, we announced the payment of our regular quarterly dividend in December, which we believe demonstrates our confidence in the company's future success."",
  ""Now, I'll turn the conversation back to Jeremy for his outlook.""
]","[
  ""Oh, can you hear me now?"",
  ""So first, just curious, so since the election, have you guys seen any notable changes in demand from your customers?"",
  ""It seems like just talking to others in the industry, they talked about the election being a, certainly, distraction for the end consumer."",
  ""So, curious to get your thoughts on what you've seen so far."",
  ""That's good to hear, certainly encouraging."",
  ""And then, in terms of the three new casegoods collections, you talked about speed to market certainly driving that."",
  ""How impactful could that be for the fourth quarter as you look to get those products to retailers?"",
  ""That makes a lot of sense."",
  ""And you've done a nice job improving the gross margin at HMI."",
  ""Do you think you can further improve from here or what are your thoughts there, Jeremy?"",
  ""And as far as the inventory situation here, so you talked about having excess inventories."",
  ""Overall, your inventory was higher at the end of third quarter than we expected."",
  ""So, how would you describe your current inventory position and the quality of that inventory, and any sort of goal for your inventory at the end of your fiscal year?"",
  ""That makes a lot of sense."",
  ""And then, lastly for me before I pass it on to others, so Jeremy, I know you were very upbeat about the Margaritaville launch when you announced this, I believe, in October."",
  ""Can you provide any more details as to how impactful that deal could be for you guys?"",
  ""Well,  very much and best of luck."",
  ""Just wanted to ask my first question around the macro demand environment going into this holiday season."",
  ""Is there any potential to see continued discounting through the back part of this year?"",
  ""Just around the macro environment and the holiday season coming up, is there any potential for continued discounting as we go into the back quarter of the year?"",
  ""And then, just want to touch on the bankruptcy."",
  ""Are there any other customers that you're seeing as highly at risk?"",
  ""And is there any recourse to recover some of that write-off?"",
  ""And then, I did have another question around the licensing deal."",
  ""I was hoping you could speak a little more around the logistics and next steps and maybe what early wins would look like it."",
  ""It looks like this is a decent amount of white space for you all."",
  ""And then, just one last question from me, a two-parter around cost savings."",
  ""Should we expect any further severance costs in 4Q?"",
  ""And then, looking into the next year, should we expect the $10 million to be evenly spread out or would we expect that to be more backend-weighted as the cost – those cost savings ramp?"",
  "" That's all very helpful."",
  "" for taking my questions and good luck in the fourth quarter."",
  ""So, we've noticed a – we've had a noticeable positive bump in order rates since the election, for sure."",
  ""Well, it definitely gives us a better shot at some better shipments at Hooker Branded because we're going to ship first cutting in November, second cutting in January specifically to direct container customers that that will affect first."",
  ""But I think the more significant part of it is the fact that we're putting those collections in position for the next fiscal year to gain the full benefit of those hitting floors for the entire year and not half of the year."",
  ""I would say a little bit, and just to stress, most of that improvement was simply getting out of businesses we should not have been in, which obviously takes the average very positive compared to where we were when we had businesses losing money in a low margin business like the ACH business."",
  ""The fact that we're out of that, it's no longer a drag on the overall average."",
  ""So, that's been the biggest benefit for us."",
  ""But we do still think there's a little bit of room for improvement."",
  ""I would call our inventory position the best it's been probably, Paul, in probably two years."",
  ""And I say that not only because of the positive inventory we have on the Hooker Branded side that are some of our best SKUs, but not having the drag of something like ACH on the other side, which negatively impacts the entire inventory as well."",
  ""So, we really don't have the problem inventory within our system anymore like we did with the ACH."",
  ""We only – our increase is in really good SKUs."",
  ""Well, we believe it's going to be very impactful."",
  ""What's interesting about the Margaritaville license from our standpoint is it really affects a lot of our divisions."",
  ""It's not really just going to be a Hooker Branded thing, for example."",
  ""It's going to be Hooker Legacy."",
  ""It's – that's going to really affect positively, we believe, our contract divisions."",
  ""There's a lot of opportunity with hospitality and through H Contract that will give us an advantage with a lot of those jobs because Margaritaville is building a significant number of homes in areas that will be attached to in pricing those models and whatnot."",
  ""So, there's just – it opens a lot of doors that would not be opened otherwise."",
  ""Can you repeat that, Dave?"",
  ""There was a little bit of static or something on the line."",
  ""We don't believe any more than normal."",
  ""And that's what you're mentioning is the reason we're going to launch in October."",
  ""The temptation, of course, is to move faster than that and try to launch in April."",
  ""But ride is going to be much more important than fast for us and we want to get this right."",
  ""So, the logistics right now of everything are pulling that together from Sunset West, our outdoor company, is obviously heavily involved."",
  ""All of our Domestic Upholstery is involved."",
  ""Hooker Branded is involved, contracts involved, hospitality."",
  ""So right now, the biggest thing we're working on is pulling everything together the way it needs to be pulled together in order to make – to put our best foot forward on a launch."",
  ""So – and that that will continue until we get there."",
  ""I would like to thank everyone on the call for their interest in Hooker Furnishings and wish you all a happy holiday season."",
  ""We look forward to sharing our fiscal 2025 full year results in April next year."",
  ""We talked – I know [indiscernible (00:17:27) we talked about discounting excess inventories and building inventory."",
  ""And what we're doing is cleaning up the inventory, get rid of slow-moving stuff to free up the working capital to invest in better SKUs in the new products and in our bestselling SKUs."",
  ""Normal – yeah, normal promotions, e-com in particular."",
  ""We tend to run some specials, but it's targeted promotions."",
  ""Well, you probably know who that – the customer is."",
  ""And there's probably not a lot of recourse."",
  ""We've done what we can to mitigate that loss."",
  ""And that's really the only big customer that we – there's always a small customer here or there that's bankrupt."",
  ""We haven't really noticed a particularly significant change in the pace of bankruptcies or distressed receivables."",
  ""But that was one We don't expect significant additional – at this point anyway, we don't expect significant additional restructuring costs."",
  ""We've got one more element, one more reasonably large element of our cost savings program that we still need to execute."",
  ""But I would say that most of it's going to be in place for the better part of the year."",
  ""We haven't started really – we haven't fully realized a lot of those savings yet, but we expect to start seeing those in the fourth quarter."",
  ""And I would say that most of the $10 million will be evenly spread through next year.""

  ""I would like to welcome you to the Culp quarterly conference call with analysts and investors."",
  ""With me on the call today are Ken Bowling, our Chief Financial Officer; Mary Beth Hunsberger, President of our Upholstery Fabrics business; and Tommy Bruno, President of our Mattress Fabrics business."",
  ""Today, I will begin the call with some detailed comments."",
  ""And as mentioned in the introduction, we have posted an updated slide presentation to our Investor Relations website."",
  ""It covers information on the progress of our restructuring plan and the timing to completion, which we will refer to today."",
  ""Ken will then review the financial results for the quarter."",
  ""After that, I'll briefly discuss our business outlook for the second half of fiscal 2025, and we will take some questions."",
  ""For the second quarter, we made continued progress on our plan to return to consolidated profitability post restructuring, even within the currently challenged demand environment."",
  ""We are making changes to our platforms and improving our market position in both segments of our business."",
  ""While we certainly expect the demand pressure in the quarter, the worsening conditions in the Upholstery Fabrics segment were an added headwind to our pace of recovery."",
  ""Specifically, we saw accelerated softness in our residential Upholstery Fabrics business leading to lower-than-expected sales performance."",
  ""Nevertheless, we remain encouraged with our strategic approach, our comprehensive restructuring process and the growth we expect for market share penetration along with an eventual normalized environment."",
  ""In spite of the 5% decline in consolidated year-over-year revenue for the second quarter, we believe we are outperforming the industry average."",
  ""We were especially pleased with the sequential improvement in sales and operating performance from our Mattress Fabrics segment during the quarter."",
  ""Sales for this segment increased 7.1% compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025 driven by higher order levels, which we believe are indicative of our growing market position."",
  ""We are steadily securing new opportunities in both fabrics and sewn covers,  to robust product development and a strategic supply chain."",
  ""We are providing our customers with innovative and functional solutions and serving them with speed to market and long-term supply security."",
  ""The Mattress Fabrics segment also sequentially reduced its operating loss by 70.7% for the quarter, reflecting the solid progress we are making with our restructuring activity, and we expect this segment to return to a profitable run rate in the second half of this fiscal year."",
  ""The vast majority of our restructuring will be complete in the third quarter."",
  ""And at the end of November, we have fully ceased production in Canada."",
  ""With the completion of this initiative, we will have a preferred manufacturing and sourcing supply chain model, featuring an improved and efficient USA location in North Carolina for fabrics, and a rightsized cut and sew platform in Haiti, which is located on the Northeast Dominican Republic border."",
  ""Our near-shore Haiti platform also includes recently installed quilting capability, with new equipment, which opens an additional product opportunity for CHF and an additional service offering to our customers."",
  ""Our North American capacity has been expanded by strong supply chain operations in Asia, including a growing platform for fabrics and cut and sew covers in Vietnam as well as a long-term Turkey relationship for high-volume fabric supply."",
  ""We are executing continual operational improvements."",
  ""And with the benefit of the restructuring activities, we expect increased margins on knits, wovens and sown covers in the back half of the fiscal year."",
  ""Despite all of this positive information, as expected due to the scope of this restructuring initiative, inefficiencies associated with the process did affect Mattress Fabrics operating performance during Q2."",
  ""Turning to our Upholstery Fabrics segment."",
  ""Sales for residential fabrics were affected by more dramatic weakness in residential home furnishing sales."",
  ""While we did expect pressure during the period, we experienced larger impacts from customers adjusting their inventory levels to align with demand after a strong ordering period during the first quarter."",
  ""This included a significant and temporary reduction in orders from a large customer during the second quarter, which is also expected to affect sales during our third quarter."",
  ""It is important to note that in the face of this pressure, we remain optimistic about our residential fabrics potential as we have noted strong customer reaction at both the recent High Point Furniture market and the Interwoven Fabric Show."",
  ""Our product line is diverse, consumer-focused and stylish, and we are diligent in presenting our customers with varied supply chain strategies."",
  ""With uncertainty around tariffs and trade regulations, it is important to offer supply chain options."",
  ""And we are doing that by developing products via our extensive Asia operations with increased focus in Vietnam, while also reviewing other parts of the world to enable a preferred response."",
  ""We also recently unveiled a new branding strategy at the Interwoven Fabric Show to accentuate our LiveSmart brand of performance fabrics."",
  ""More to come on this as we look ahead, but we are strengthening our offering of performance, sustainability and well-being focused products."",
  ""As fabrics with increased functionality of becoming an expectation for many of our manufacturing customers."",
  ""Additionally, sales for our hospitality contract fabric business remained solid during the quarter, representing 35% of CUF's total sales, and we are realizing increased potential with commercial fabrics and window treatments."",
  ""This hospitality contract part of the business generally affords higher margins, and we are building a strong model to supply a diverse product range."",
  ""Of particular note is the improvement we are making with window treatments under our Read Window platform."",
  ""We are currently producing window treatments in Knoxville, Tennessee and we are expanding our blackout roller shape production in Burlington, North Carolina week by week."",
  ""The window treatment portion of our business is an important profit improvement target for the second half of fiscal 2025."",
  ""Overall, we remain pleased with the Upholstery Fabrics segment's continuing profitability supported by an asset-light platform."",
  ""Our foreign exchange rate associated with our operations in China was a pressure to operating results in Q2."",
  ""We are currently seeing a favorable currency impact in Q3."",
  ""It is expected to be a profit tailwind for us during the quarter."",
  ""The actions we have taken over the last year to rationalize our finishing operation and improve our supply chain are lowering our manufacturing costs for Upholstery Fabrics, which gives us confidence to navigate our business through a variety of environments."",
  ""I'd now like to circle back to give more detail on the progress of our Mattress Fabrics restructuring actions."",
  ""As we have discussed previously, we announced a wide-ranging restructuring plan in early May with the primary focus on our Mattress Fabrics segment."",
  ""The announced adjustments once fully implemented, will enable us to operate more efficiently and profitably with a lower level of fixed costs and without limiting our ability to grow the business."",
  ""This restructuring initiative is critical to us returning to consolidated profitability in its current pressured environment."",
  ""As already discussed, Mattress Fabrics operating results were pressured by these restructuring actions in the second quarter but we believe we are on target to achieve positive consolidated adjusted EBITDA for the second half of fiscal 2025 and a return to positive consolidated adjusted operating income sometime in the fourth quarter."",
  ""Mattress Fabrics improvement is the critical catalyst to our consolidated recovery."",
  ""As we rationalize our capacity, reduce fixed costs and increase efficiency, we expect to make significant improvements to our financial results even without typical sales growth from a macro market recovery."",
  ""This point is illustrated mathematically in a hypothetical example on page 6 of the updated restructuring deck."",
  ""Again, to reiterate, our Mattress Fabrics restructuring is a comprehensive undertaking that impacts people, plant consolidations, equipment relocation and process improvements."",
  ""But with that, we are successfully lowering our cost structure despite weak demand, and we look forward to meeting our objectives."",
  ""I do want to emphasize that we are grateful for the support we have received from our valued employees, customers and suppliers during this process, and we are confident that the strength of these relationships are helping to drive our recovery."",
  ""It is our focus to consolidate our operating facilities efficiently without any disruption to programs or customers."",
  ""The scale and scope of this Mattress Fabrics restructuring cannot be overstated."",
  ""It's a dynamic process, but one that will be accretive."",
  ""We are enhancing our business platform in the current environment and with our growing market position driven by innovation and styling along with improving operational activities and best-in-class manufacturing and sourcing capabilities, we believe we are very well positioned for the future."",
  ""I'd also like to again remind you that we have updated our restructuring slide deck, and it's posted on our Investor Relations page."",
  ""The slide deck purpose is to help illustrate the details of the restructuring plan, including the actions we are taking, the time line for those actions and the expected financial impact."",
  ""Updating the progress of our restructuring initiatives, the consolidation of our North American Mattress Fabrics operation is largely complete, with a phased wind-down and pending closure of our manufacturing facility in Canada."",
  ""We discontinued knitting production at our Canadian facility in Q2, and we just discontinued damask weaving production at this facility last week."",
  ""With that step, we now have fully transitioned our damask weaving business to a sourcing model, primarily with one of our long-term dedicated manufacturing partners, which will improve margins for this business."",
  ""We are also nearing completion of the relocation of certain knitting and finishing equipment to our Stokesdale, North Carolina facility, and we expect the last steps of this optimization will be finalized by the end of the third quarter."",
  ""We also completed the consolidation of our Haiti sewn mattress cover operation during the first quarter, reducing our cost and establishing steady run schedules in this location."",
  ""And we recently added quilting capabilities for important new product development."",
  ""This near-shore platform serves an important piece of our Mattress Fabric supply chain for cut and sewn cover capacity."",
  ""Additionally, we have listed for sale and are actively marketing our Canadian property."",
  ""And we hope to exit and sell that facility in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year."",
  ""But of course, the timing of that will be dependent on the market and interest for the building."",
  ""More details and general timeline again are found on page 4 of the updated restructuring deck."",
  ""Beyond this restructuring process, our expectation is to return to positive consolidated adjusted operating income, excluding restructuring related charges and the currently depressed demand level sometime in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""Our plan continues to project a solid $10 million to $11 million in annualized cost and productivity savings from the restructuring, mostly be in the Mattress Fabrics division."",
  ""But we do expect to generate over $1 million in annualized savings from reductions with unallocated corporate and shared services."",
  ""Based on the restructuring activities that have been completed, along with our updated estimates on those that remain underway, we now expect to incur total restructuring related charges of $7.3 million."",
  ""Cash charges are now expected to be $4.4 million, increased somewhat as a result of a strategic decision to retain and relocate some additional equipment to optimize efficiency and due to some increased severance charges in Canada."",
  ""We expect the vast majority of these charges will have been incurred by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""We also anticipate funding close to $2 million of the cash cost with proceeds from the sale of excess manufacturing equipment and a building lease termination in Haiti."",
  ""And we currently expect approximately $6 million to $8 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Canadian facility."",
  ""Our expected proceeds from the building and property sale has decreased somewhat due to a hardening real estate market, along with Canadian Ministry zoning changes, limiting some industrial activities in Saint-Jérôme, Quebec."",
  ""It is important to emphasize that these expected cash proceeds are after all property, real estate and taxes associated with winding down our operations in Canada."",
  ""A cash and liquidity update is shown on slide 5 of the restructuring slide deck."",
  ""The expected benefit of our restructuring actions on both profitability and liquidity is evident."",
  ""And again, this is all assuming no lift in market demand."",
  ""Closing my comments and looking ahead."",
  ""We are optimistic about the progress we are making with our restructuring initiatives, as well as our solid market position in both businesses."",
  ""We are optimizing our operations and cost structure, providing excellent customer service and winning new placements with our innovative product portfolio."",
  ""Although the restructuring activity involves a significant undertaking and short-term inefficiencies, we are demonstrating quarter-by-quarter operating improvement in a challenged macro demand environment."",
  ""Importantly, while we anticipate that the industry conditions will remain somewhat pressured through fiscal 2025, we expect the strategic actions we are taking will position us for a return to profitability post restructuring again at the currently depressed demand levels, as well as growth opportunities as market conditions improve."",
  ""I'll now turn the call over to Ken, who will review the financial results for the quarter, and then I'll review the outlook we are providing as we look ahead to the second half of fiscal 2025."",
  ""As we've talked about due to the expected continued pressure on sales and the significant restructuring activity underway in the Mattress Fabrics segment, we are only providing limited financial guidance at this time."",
  ""We expect our consolidated net sales for the third quarter to be flat to slightly down sequentially with continued pressure on residential Upholstery Fabrics, and approximately one week less in shipping days for both segments due to customer holiday closures."",
  ""We currently expect positive adjusted EBITDA, excluding restructuring and related charges for the second half for this fiscal year and a return to positive consolidated adjusted operating income, excluding restructuring and related charges sometime in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year."",
  ""With that, we will now take your questions."",
  ""As we start, let me state that this morning's call will contain forward-looking statements about the business, financial condition and prospects of the company."",
  ""Forward-looking statements are statements that include projections, expectations or beliefs about future events or results or otherwise are not statements of historical fact."",
  ""The actual performance of the company could differ materially from that indicated by the forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties."",
  ""These risks and uncertainties are described in our regular SEC filings, including the company's most recent filings on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also affect our business operations and financial results."",
  ""You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements made today, and each such statement speaks only as of today."",
  ""We undertake no obligation to update or to revise forward-looking statements."",
  ""In addition, during this call, the company will be discussing non-GAAP financial measurements."",
  ""A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measurements to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measurement is included in the tables to the press release included as an exhibit to the company's 8-K filed yesterday and posted on the company's website at culp.com."",
  ""A slide presentation on the company's restructuring plan is also available on the company's website as part of the webcast of today's call."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to Iv Culp, President and Chief Executive Officer of Culp."",
  ""Here are the financial highlights for the second quarter."",
  ""Net sales were $55.7 million, down 5.2% compared with the prior-year period."",
  ""The company reported a loss from operations of $5.4 million, which included $2.8 million in restructuring expansion related charges as compared with the loss from operations of $2.2 million for the prior year period, which included 66,000 in restructuring related charges."",
  ""Adjusted loss from operations was $2.6 million, compared with an adjusted loss from operations of $2.2 million the prior year period."",
  ""Notably, the $2.6 million adjusted operating loss was sequentially improved as compared to Q1's adjusted operating loss."",
  ""I'll comment a more detail on divisional sales and operating performance in a moment."",
  ""Net loss for the second quarter was $5.6 million or $0.45 per diluted share, compared with a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.19 per diluted share for the prior year period."",
  ""Our overall operating performance for the second quarter was pressured by lower sales and inefficiencies primarily related to the significant restructuring activity underway in the Mattress Fabrics segment."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 month period ending with Q2 was a negative $1.3 million as compared to negative 240,000 for the prior year period."",
  ""The effective income tax rate for the second quarter of this fiscal year was 0.9%, compared with a negative 27% for the same period a year ago."",
  ""Our effective income tax rate for the quarter continues to be impacted by the company's mix of earnings between our US and foreign subsidiaries, with an operating loss in the US, a significant operating loss in Canada due to the restructuring effort and taxable income, mostly from China, which has a higher income tax rate compared to the US."",
  ""Expected cash income tax payments for this year will not be given at this time due to the restructuring effort."",
  ""Notably, we do not expect to incur any income taxes in the US on a cash basis for the foreseeable future due to our existing US federal net operating loss carryforwards, totaling almost $70 million as of the end of last fiscal year end."",
  ""Now let's take a look at our two business segments."",
  ""For the Mattress Fabrics segment, sales for the second quarter were $30.1 million, down 4.2% compared with last year's second quarter."",
  ""Sequentially, sales were up 7.1% compared with the prior quarter."",
  ""While year-over-year sales were affected by weakness in the domestic mattress industry, the sequential improvement in sales was driven by higher order levels, which we believe are indicative of CHF's product innovation and improving market position."",
  ""Operating loss for the quarter was $1 million compared to an operating loss of $936,000 a year ago and compared to an operating loss of $3.5 million for the prior quarter."",
  ""Our operating performance for the quarter was pressured by lower year-over-year sales volumes and manufacturing inefficiencies, including those related to the significant restructuring initiatives to wind down CHF's Canadian operation and moved certain knitting equipment to our Stokesdale, North Carolina facility."",
  ""However, while restructuring-related inefficiency negatively affected the quarter, the reduction in operating loss as compared sequentially to the first quarter of this fiscal year, reflecting the significant progress CHF is making to reduce costs, especially lower fixed costs related to the closure of the Canadian facility."",
  ""For the Upholstery Fabric segment sales for the first quarter were $25.6 million, down 6.4% compared to the prior year period."",
  ""Sequentially, sales were down 10% compared to the prior quarter."",
  ""The reduction in sales was driven primarily by further demand weakness in the residential home furnishings industry, which resulted in lower order levels that some customers, including a significant customer adjusted their inventory to align with soft industry demand."",
  ""This Sales for our Hospitality contract business, including Read Window were flat compared to both prior year and sequential periods."",
  ""Income from operations for the quarter was $615,000 compared with income from operations of $1.4 million a year ago."",
  ""Operating performance for the quarter was affected by lower sales and unfavorable China foreign currency exchange rate and higher freight costs, offset somewhat by lower SG&A and lower fixed costs."",
  ""Now let me turn to the balance sheet."",
  ""We reported $10.5 million total cash and $4.1 million outstanding debt under our China credit line as of the end of the second quarter."",
  ""Cash flow from operations and free cash flow were negative $2.6 million and a negative $3.4 million, respectively, for the first six months of this fiscal year compared with cash flow from operations and free cash flow of negative $4.5 million and a negative $5.6 million, respectively, for the same period last fiscal year."",
  ""Our cash flow from operations and free cash flow during the first six months of this fiscal year affected by operating losses and planned strategic investments in capital expenditures, mostly related to the Mattress Fabrics segment, partially offset by lower working capital."",
  ""Capital expenditures for the first six months of this fiscal year were $1.6 million, based on current expectations, capital spending for this fiscal year is projected to be approximately $3.5 million to $4 million and will center mostly on maintenance, CapEx and quick payback projects that will increase efficiencies and improve quality, especially for the Mattress Fabrics segment."",
  ""Based on current expectations, depreciation for this year – for this fiscal year is expected to be approximately $5.6 million."",
  ""With respect to liquidity, as of the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $33.1 million, consisting of $10.5 million in cash and $22.6 million of borrowing availability under our domestic credit facility."",
  ""As noted earlier, we also had $4.1 million in borrowings outstanding under our China credit line as of the end of the quarter."",
  ""The company's existing and future borrowings under our domestic and foreign credit facilities during this fiscal year are in connection with our restructuring activities, the timing of payments to vendors ahead of the Chinese New Year holiday and to fund worldwide working capital to grow the business."",
  ""Importantly, given these objectives, our outstanding borrowings could exceed our available cash at the end of the third quarter for a net debt position as we await the sale of our Canadian facility."",
  ""We did not repurchase any shares during the first half of this fiscal year, leaving $3.2 million available under our current share repurchase program."",
  ""Despite the current share repurchase authorization, we do not expect any activity during the third quarter as we remain focused on preserving liquidity and being positioned to support future growth opportunities."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call back over to Iv to discuss the general outlook for the second half of this fiscal year, and then we will take your questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""My first question is on the sequential improvement that we saw in the mattress industry."",
  ""I think it's pretty impressive given the current industry headwind."",
  ""Is it right to think that you guys are gaining share in this business?"",
  ""And what do you attribute the strong order growth here?"",
  ""Just to follow up, do you see that positive momentum going through Q3, Q4?"",
  ""So my next question is on the Upholstery side of the business."",
  ""I mean I would say that the contraction that we did see, while it was potentially unexpected, it's definitely not surprising given what's happening in the industry overall."",
  ""My question though would be how much of the change that you guys saw is a reflection of the underlying demand versus your customers just being more conservative in how they're building inventories for 2025."",
  ""And do you have any insight into what that delta might be between the inventory build and the end demand dynamics?"",
  ""That's good to... Yeah, certainly."",
  ""If I could pivot just very quickly though to the contract and hospitality side, and that on a relative basis was an outperformer."",
  ""Could you maybe break down the difference between what's happening on the office side versus the hospitality side?"",
  ""I think that's a good point to know."",
  ""The next question, if I may, maybe more of a question for Ken."",
  ""There's obviously a lot of moving parts with the restructuring."",
  ""I was hoping that maybe we could get a little bit more insight into what the economics of the mattress business is going to look like when we move through the current restructuring."",
  ""Kind of more specifically, how should investors be thinking about what the breakeven point for this segment could be?"",
  ""And then what do contribution margins look like on the other end of this?"",
  ""Yeah, I would agree with that."",
  ""I think as I look at the model, the potential for really significant operating leverage moving forward is probably what I am most focused on."",
  ""So definitely,  for that."",
  ""I have one kind of final question and this is probably more for you, Iv."",
  ""How concerned are you about the potential for increased tariffs under the new administration?"",
  ""And what the set of options that you guys have at the ready to respond to any potential changes that you see on that front?"",
  ""And best of luck up for the third quarter, and we'll be speaking again soon."",
  "" for jumping on us today."",
  ""I'm going to pivot this primarily to Tommy because he's managing that business, but we are very encouraged with where we're headed in Mattress Fabrics."",
  ""As we talked about, the catalyst to us getting back to our commitment of profitability in this environment is Mattress Fabrics."",
  ""And we are quite pleased with the performance and where they're ahead of it."",
  ""Tommy, you may want to context as to what you see in share and what you see in general macro demand?"",
  ""Brian, I'm going to pivot."",
  ""That's Mary Beth because she lived in the Upholstery segment day by day."",
  ""But it is a really good question and one we've thought a lot about."",
  ""The Upholstery segment has been a stalwart for us through a lot of ups and downs."",
  ""It's remained profitable, and we're bullish on that segment."",
  ""There's been a lot of interest from our customer base and new products, and there's a thirst to get that innovative product to retail floors."",
  ""And I think that as we get out and start to see some improvement, there were some just some customers getting ahead of themselves and ordering more than they needed, and now we're being caught in an adjustment."",
  ""But Mary Beth, you can add color as to what you see and what it means."",
  ""And Brian, we're talking residential fabrics here at this point."",
  ""Mary Beth, add some color to that."",
  ""And Brian, I would add one more thing on – just as you tease on hospitality, I mean, it's important for investors to understand, it's a two-part hospitality business."",
  ""We have a very robust fabric business that we sell to hospitality, guest rooms, public space, cinemas, whatever it may be."",
  ""And we also have a very strong building window treatment business for hotels, timeshares, blackout roller shades, a lot of excitement in the hospitality segment of that business, fabrics and window treatments."",
  ""We're getting that discussion frequently with customers today in the news a lot, of course and while there are no sure answers, there aren't safe, easy, plug-and-play options."",
  ""I think on that topic, like I feel as good as I could feel the way both businesses are set up and let each of them – I'll let Tommy and Mary Beth both speak to it, why they're confident."",
  ""But I think we've always had a mindset of maintaining optionality in our supply chain and being able to flex our business to where we need to serve a customer."",
  ""And that will be no different with tariffs."",
  ""And we have great strategies in both businesses."",
  ""From an asset-light model in CUF that allows flexibility to budding U.S. stronghold in the mattress side."",
  ""So I'm excited about both."",
  ""But I know Tommy and Mary Beth both have bigger pieces than just as they think about it."",
  ""So Tommy, you want to go first on how you're hearing about tariffs in your space?"",
  ""And again,  to everyone for your participation and your interest in Culp."",
  ""We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter."",
  ""Brian, yes, we are growing our share."",
  ""That is the primary contribution in terms of regrowing sequentially from the bottom in Q4."",
  ""The macro environment does remain challenged, but we have had some strategic placements and good run rates on new programs that we feel confident about to continue our growth through the back half of this year."",
  ""So, we see the run rates on our business being pretty stable."",
  ""We feel confident in the run rate."",
  ""As Iv mentioned, we do have one week of less shipping days in Q3."",
  ""But we have good momentum, and we've got a docket of new programs that are scheduled to launch in Q3 and Q4."",
  ""Yeah, I would definitely say that most of our customers have reported continued pressure in the industry, perhaps longer than we anticipated earlier in the year."",
  ""While we did see some uptick in enthusiasm in Q1, the customer proved us wrong and proved that we were perhaps too aggressive, some of our customers too aggressive in building their inventory in Q1."",
  ""So now assuming that the industry recovery is delayed into  Sure."",
  ""So within our Contract Hospitality numbers, a subsection of that is office furniture, primarily seating."",
  ""And since COVID with the – just decline and changes in how we work in offices, that portion of that channel is down significantly."",
  ""So if you tease out the two parts, we're seeing extreme favorability with hospitality with the large pipeline of hotels and the number of brand standards that we've been able to capture."",
  ""So that is outpacing and overcoming this loss on the office seating side."",
  ""Yeah, it's a great question."",
  ""I think, obviously, getting through the restructuring is priority one, and that's – we're making great progress on that, and we're looking forward to that point."",
  ""I think I would look at it as the – we said that on an annualized basis, once all activity had been completed, we would generate at least $10 million of savings."",
  ""So if you refer to that slide in the deck, the restructuring slide, it shows the potential that CHF has once we get past the restructuring."",
  ""The other thing that we're excited about, I mean, that's step number one is to get to that point and get those savings implemented."",
  ""The second part is the confidence and the encouragement that we have with regard to as the business grows, the leverage that we get from just being able to have the current platform in place, both fixed cost and SG&A and the leverage we would get from there as we grow sales."",
  ""I mean, that's the exciting part."",
  ""I mean we're going to be profitable at the current level."",
  ""But when we start growing, we're going to leverage those fixed costs and be able to really take advantage of a lot of opportunity there to grow the bottom line."",
  ""So get the restructuring in place first, get profitable and then grow the business."",
  ""And that's where the real growth comes from in opportunity."",
  ""Yeah, Brian, for us, we are – we're very pleased with the fact that we've now moved all of our capabilities into the US, which really insulates us quite a bit versus the things that we're hearing from the incoming administration."",
  ""So having our mega plant be in North Carolina, we feel is a value to our customers."",
  ""It can provide confidence in security."",
  ""And then across the world, one of the things we like about our nearshore cut and sew – our nearshore cut and sew is that it allows us to bring fabrics in duty and tariff free and So we feel like we're pretty well insulated on the mattress side."",
  ""And then we have options in Vietnam now that we've set up and we started manufacturing."",
  ""So depending on how things go, we feel like we've got a lot of different varied options to present all of our customers."",
  ""And Brian, I would say from the Upholstery side, the vast majority of our products do not ship into the US."",
  ""So we are fairly insulated from that as well for the portion that does ship into the US."",
  ""The nice thing about an asset-light model and two to three decades of relationships with global suppliers means that we are nimble."",
  ""We have begun a few years ago some setup in Vietnam."",
  ""We are continuing to focus there."",
  ""But again, we can pivot as needed.""

  "", Gunnar, and welcome, everyone, to the call."",
  ""Q3 was another strong quarter of execution and innovation."",
  ""We delivered financial results above our guidance, with total revenue of $699 million and non-GAAP operating income of $304 million."",
  ""It was a really great quarter of execution by the Veeva team."",
  ""We saw a broad-based adoption in all areas of Development Cloud."",
  ""We also had a number of significant milestones in Commercial, including great progress on Vault CRM."",
  ""It's an exciting time as we look ahead to our 2030 goals."",
  ""We'll now open up the call to your questions."",
  ""As a reminder, we posted prepared remarks on Veeva's Investor Relations website just after 1:00 PM Pacific today."",
  ""We hope you have had a chance to read them before the call."",
  ""Today's call will be primarily used for Q&A. With me today for Q&A are Peter Gassner, our Chief Executive Officer; Paul Shawah, EVP, Strategy; and Brian Van Wagener, our Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""During this call, we may make forward-looking statements regarding trends, our strategies and the anticipated performance of the business, including guidance regarding future financial results."",

  ""With that,  for joining us, and I'll turn the call over to Peter.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions here and nice job this quarter."",
  ""Peter, maybe just to start with you, to your point, Veeva did have some nice innovation this quarter, particularly with Vault CRM."",
  ""So, I was wondering, as you talk to customers about their migration away from Veeva CRM and away from other potential competitors, what sort of the future – what are the future roadmaps that you're, sort of, speaking to them around the benefits of Vault CRM?"",
  ""I guess, as we all sort of wonder about the effort involved in moving off of Veeva CRM, what are you talking about the main benefits when moving to Vault CRM, if that makes sense?"",
  ""Brian, maybe for my follow-up for you."",
  ""It was great to see the strong Q4 billings outlook remain largely unchanged, of course, on the back of a strong Q3 as well."",
  ""Maybe the question is, can you just talk a little bit about how much the CDMS ramps are contributing to that?"",
  ""And how you sort of think about CDMS as a driver for billings going into next year as well, even anecdotally?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""This first one, just could be Peter or Paul."",
  ""You touched on MLR Bot as potentially being a second – well, it will be a separate license."",
  ""One, I guess, what kind of early interest are you getting there?"",
  ""And then, two, when we think about the potential monetization, is it going to be comparable to one of your commercial modules, which I think in the past you've said is a 10% to 15% uplift, or is this something more value-add and something you can charge higher for?"",
  ""And then, Brian, also in the prepared remarks, you guys touched on kind of good billings upside driven by services."",
  ""And when I think about the first part of the year, perhaps some push out in services."",
  ""Now you're calling out potentially some better services."",
  ""Anything to read into that or, again, maybe more just kind of one-off timing dynamic?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""In the prepared remarks, there was mention that Veeva is making progress on several large strategic partnership opportunities in Development Cloud."",
  ""I wanted to see if these are maybe similar in scope to how Veeva has come to work with the likes of Merck and BI, and what was discussed under kind of those large strategic engagements?"",
  ""And if not or if so, can you maybe speak to any commonality in terms of the discussions you're having, the type of solutions or end objectives that sponsors are looking to achieve and see as possible by just leveraging Veeva in a greater way?"",
  ""And then, I guess, I'll ask my annual question, just given customers are well into their budgeting for the New Year."",
  ""Veeva typically has good visibility at this point in terms of how some of those plans are coming together."",
  ""How does your visibility on intended performance in 2026 compared to what you normally have at this point in time?"",
  ""Not asking for a number, but just kind of how visibility compares."",
  ""And would you maybe say, it's any better or worse by virtue of things like ramping agreements that you know are coming or just the state of active discussions with customers?"",
  "" for taking the question and congrats on the strong quarter."",
  ""Peter, I just certainly wanted to hit on the regulatory backdrop."",
  ""I know there's a lot of potential changes coming in the Trump administration, at least that are being discussed."",
  ""I'd love to understand what your customer feedback has been there?"",
  ""And how you think about the potential implications to Veeva under a new administration?"",
  ""And maybe a follow-up for Brian."",
  ""The margin upside this quarter was really impressive."",
  ""Just anything that you would call out in terms of timing of expenses in the third quarter?"",
  ""Would appreciate any perspective there."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""Peter, maybe I just wanted to ask on the Boehringer deal on the large Vault win there."",
  ""Just curious as to what the tenor or thoroughness of the evaluation process that maybe they were going through and how that compares to other perspective migrations in the pipeline from the top 20."",
  ""Just trying to understand maybe how deep they are sort of evaluating other solutions in the marketplace versus just sort of being a Veeva-only type discussion at this point?"",
  ""Maybe just a follow-up for Brian."",
  ""Obviously, with the rollout of these generative AI applications, a few of them being sort of included at no additional charge."",
  ""How should we think about how that impacts gross margins going into next year, understanding that, obviously, we're not giving guidance yet for next year."",
  ""But just generally, how you think that as the adoption usage of that, the GenAI apps grows over the next year, any sort of impacts we should expect from a margin perspective?"",
  "" so much for taking the question."",
  ""You highlighted that your Safety Solutions are approaching a tipping point."",
  ""And I was wondering if maybe you could provide a little bit more color about what that means."",
  ""And then, could you just remind us of the relative size of this market?"",
  ""And where Veeva is differentiated here?"",
  ""And then, maybe just one more."",
  ""You noted that your customers are, as you said, settling into the current macro."",
  ""And I was wondering, are you viewing this as the new normal?"",
  ""And if not, what are you monitoring for early signs of an inflection from here?"",
  ""And which areas of your business would really see a change first?"",
  ""And I apologize for background noise, if it comes through."",
  ""I was wondering, I understand you answered the question about changes in administration earlier."",
  ""But theoretically, if appointments were approved and if appointments followed through on some of their desires and direct-to-consumer advertising was eliminated, how would that impact your business model, positively or negatively?"",
  ""I think, this one is for Paul."",
  ""Paul, I want to revisit the discussion on Commercial growth and specifically on what's happening with the seat count dynamic versus the add-on and the upsell dynamic within seat count based Commercial."",
  ""Maybe just give us an update on how those two factors are playing out and to what extent you're still seeing pressure in seat count and to what extent you feel confident that you can offset any seat count pressure with add-ons."",
  ""Yes, that makes a lot of sense."",
  ""The follow-up is on your learning so far from the CRM conversions to Vault that you've already done."",
  ""Maybe just highlight for us, what do you know today that you didn't know a year or two ago on easing the customer transition to Vault, and how's that helping navigate some of the conversations on the ground?"",
  ""Reading through the prepared remarks here and commentary in the call so far, something reads and feels a little different relative to the top 20 appetite to lean into the broader Veeva portfolio here."",
  ""I know historically you've talked about the top 20 governor being maybe engaging one product a year, but I get the sense that maybe there is a greater sense of urgency to move off of legacy and embrace maybe multiple products."",
  ""Walk me through the level of dialogue you're having across the whole portfolio with these top 20."",
  ""Is that the right read?"",
  ""Or is it a misread?"",
  ""And then maybe, Brian, for you, 43.5% operating margin."",
  ""This is kind of the highest we've seen out of Veeva on record, the biggest beat versus your guide in 3 years, a bit of a hot start for you for the first quarter out of the gate."",
  ""But how should we think about the cost discipline you put in place in the quarter and leverage and it just your guide obviously implies you're going to have some additional expenses here in Q4."",
  ""But walk us through the philosophy on cost discipline and leverage you showed this quarter and what it means here as we think about next year?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""First, I would just like to follow up on Vault CRM."",
  ""At the Investor Day, you had suggested more top 20 commitments likely to be announced over the next six months or so."",
  ""So clearly, these conversations are maturing."",
  ""Now, as you reflect on these discussions you're having with clients, what have been the gating factors to get these commitments?"",
  ""And with Vault CRM already out in the wild, as you say, how's the hurdle for these commitments come down at all?"",
  ""And then quickly on your pivot toward horizontal enterprise applications, when can we expect a more concrete product strategy that you'll be able to share with us?"",
  "" for taking the question here."",
  ""If you think about FY 2026, I know you're not giving formal guidance, but just any way of framing how we should think about the growth in the context of this year and your long-term targets?"",
  ""And as we think about the macro environment, clearly, your numbers have been very resilient."",
  ""But just given you do have longer sales cycles, have you seen any change in sort of the early stages of those larger deals that maybe layering in towards the back half of next year, for instance, that you would call out?"",
  ""Just going back to the horizontal strategy and the strength in the core business margin profile today, how do you think about that in terms of perhaps giving you a little bit more leverage to make some of these investments as you get that going?"",
  ""And then I just had a follow-up question on services."",
  ""Is that market looks to be stabilizing."",
  ""How do you think about that on like a multiyear profile from a growth, even if it's a range?"",
  ""Like what's a reasonable growth assumption in services looking out next couple of years?"",
  ""Congrats on a nice quarter."",
  ""Hey, Paul, one of the questions I've picked up since Salesforce reported earlier this week is that they called out Life Sciences Cloud is a component of three of their top 10 deals in the quarter."",
  ""I'm not asking you to speak for them."",
  ""But as you see what's happening at your customers, is there any sense that Salesforce is showing up more often?"",
  ""And then, Brian, a follow-up for you."",
  ""Can you just remind me of the impact that TFC has on margins this year?"",
  ""And whether there's any normalization or reversal that we should be thinking about as we set our models for next year?"",
  ""And  for taking my questions."",
  ""I want to go back to Vault CRM."",
  ""Congrats on the fourth top biopharma commitment."",
  ""Can you confirm whether it's an existing CRM customer or your new CRM customer?"",
  ""And related to that, can you remind us what is the average length of time from a customer commitment to Vault to migration, to when they are live on the platform?"",
  ""If it is largely based on customer preferences, how do they typically think about when they want to migrate post commitment?"",
  ""And on whether it's a new customer or existing CRM customer?"",
  ""And my follow up is on the decent exploration in net head count increase in the quarter, anything to read into that?"",
  ""I mean, clearly you're seeing some good momentum here."",
  ""Any particular areas you guys are focused on with respect to head count additions or is it more across the board?"",
  "" for fitting me in."",
  ""I just had two questions."",
  ""First, on the migration of these customers to Vault CRM."",
  ""I was just wondering, do we start seeing an impact to gross margin, in other words, that royalty that you paid for Salesforce for Veeva CRM?"",
  ""Is that going to improve over the next two years as these customers migrate, or should we see this sort of improve later as the agreement ends?"",
  ""And then just on the direct-to-consumer advertising comments you made earlier, I just – if you could remind us, I mean, is Crossix the one product that really is focused on that, or is there others within the commercial cloud portfolio?"",
  ""And maybe if you could add in as well, is that really – in terms of the strength that you saw this year, has this been a change versus previous year?"",
  ""Congratulations on the very good quarter."",
  ""The CROs have obviously reported some challenges."",
  ""Obviously, you're not a CRO doing the clinical trials, but you do sell into that space."",
  ""Can you maybe just talk about what the difference is there?"",
  ""Why are they seeing challenges but you are not?"",
  ""And has there been any impact to like things like Study Training or Site Connect or any more of those clinical trial-related focused products?"",
  ""And then for Vault CRM wins, I think there were 14 in the quarter."",
  ""That seems like a very good number."",
  ""They were like three and five, and five in fiscal 3Q and 4Q of 2024 and 1Q of 2025."",
  ""14 sounds like a lot."",
  ""Is that a new sort of steady state?"",
  ""And why is there like such an uptick?"",
  ""I wanted to ask about, obviously, with the Walgreens strategic partnership, maybe talk about a little bit more where you think you are in your journey in adding data sources to Compass and Data Cloud in general?"",
  ""And maybe just give us a sense on how you feel sort of your competitive position in the market there is currently?"",
  ""And maybe just a follow-up on Crossix."",
  ""Obviously, a key driver of growth in commercial."",
  ""Can you give us a sense what the Crossix growth rate has been through the first three quarters relative to the 11% growth for commercial?"",
  ""Just give us a sense, is it growing faster?"",
  ""Or is it in line?"",
  ""Any color there would be helpful."",
  ""I wanted to ask a question on just the general demand environment."",
  ""It sounds like things are fairly stable, but maybe some green shoots that you're seeing in the big pharma."",
  ""I think in some of the prepared remarks segment of the commercial business, if I'm not – I'm sorry, in the R&D business, if I'm reading that properly."",
  ""So, are you seeing any kind of indications that things might be turning positive here just in the general spending environment?"",
  ""And then anything – any update on the re-platforming effort?"",
  ""How do you feel about taking that to some of the larger accounts?"",
  ""Are you getting to the point where you're comfortable doing that?"",
  ""And any kind of early indications of how that's going?"",
  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""It's good to be covering the company again."",
  ""Just a couple of questions here."",
  ""First, on the Development Cloud."",
  ""On the back of our initiation, we did some channel checks on industry R&D spending trends, et cetera."",
  ""And one of the questions I wanted to ask on that was actually just touched on, on the last question, but maybe just to drill in a little bit deeper."",
  ""I mean it does look like clinical trial starts globally are actually growing again now for the last two quarters after declining for year-over-year for a couple of years."",
  ""So, I'm just curious as this follow-up question around that."",
  ""Do you guys actually look carefully at data points like that?"",
  ""Or do you just focus more on your own customer discussions, et cetera, that you just alluded to as far as your assessment of the marketplace?"",
  ""And then only other quick follow-up question really is just at the Analyst Day a few weeks ago, the way you guys broke down your total revenue base by customer type was just a little bit different this year than it was last year."",
  ""So, I'm hoping you can just remind us again, what percent of your total book of business relates to CRO customers just from a percentage of revenue standpoint?"",
  ""I recall it was no more than 5% last year, but I just want to confirm if that was still the case currently."",
  ""I'll try to keep that crisp."",
  ""One of the benefits is, is a really important one that they've always appreciated from Veeva is continuous innovation of features."",
  ""So, you see the Veeva CRM team, that great Veeva CRM product team, product management team who's been keeping that, that industry-leading application for the years, that's now on Vault CRM."",
  ""So, the way to stay on that innovation train is to be on Vault CRM."",
  ""So, they're looking forward to that."",
  ""The other one is the idea of a platform for customer centricity that can span sales, medical, marketing and service, a single view of the record, so that they can both be more efficient with their customers, but also more respectful."",
  ""Now, for, in life sciences, you have smaller biotechs, they may have 200 people in their company."",
  ""They may have 50,000 people in their company and over 20,000 people in their field."",
  ""So, there's different levels of appetite for change."",
  ""You can change 200 people faster than you can change 20,000 people."",
  ""So, for the small biotechs, they're looking forward to like, wow, we could just jump on and we could just be clean on that quickly."",
  ""For the larger companies, with 20,000 employees, they will look to be enthused about, well, there's potential there, right?"",
  ""We could change to that when we want to, if Veeva delivers that in the way we think they're going to."",
  ""So, they view it as optionality."",
  ""And I want to want to say this carefully, I would say similar, but not the same as BI and Merck."",
  ""And similar in that, it's a strategic level and it is across product lines, but each one is different in its own way."",
  ""Part of that has to do with, we have more products that are mature now."",
  ""And if you look when we have a great program with BI, the One Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim, the One Medicine program."",
  ""Now that was a few years ago, really, when the genesis of that started."",
  ""We have more products now in the clinical and the quality area that are mature."",
  ""So, the discussion is, now, both, its more expansive, we have more products to talk about."",
  ""And then, sometimes, these discussions are going to be very particular, it might be just in the clinical area, but it might be across all the clinical products or it might be focused on the regulatory and the clinical operations area."",
  ""But again, those are bigger areas than they used to be."",
  ""So, summary there is, similar, but different."",
  ""Just as all of the top 20 pharma companies are different from each other, they have different cultures, they have different product portfolios, they have different objectives and they have different people."",
  ""So, they're not all going to be the same."",
  ""I would say, marginally better visibility as compared to a year ago."",
  ""I think our customers have settled into this macro environment a little bit more."",
  ""I also think we have more bites at the apple."",
  ""Every year, we have more mature products."",
  ""So, therefore, no one particular thing is swinging things one way or the other."",
  ""And as you mentioned, we have these ramps."",
  ""So, I would say, slightly more visibility, but nothing dramatically different."",
  ""You want to take that one, Paul?"",
  ""So, I will take that."",
  ""Generally, we announced two GenAI solutions, one we call CRM Bot and the other one MLR Bot."",
  ""MLR Bot, we will charge for, and that's where we will host and run a large language model, not our own large language model, right."",
  ""We'll use one from the big tech providers, but we'll be paying for the compute power for that, and so we'll be charging for that."",
  ""For the CRM Bot, that's where we will hook our CRM system into the customers' own large language model that they're running."",
  ""And that's where we'll – we will not charge for and we will not incur compute cost."",
  ""So, where we have to use significant compute power, we will most likely charge."",
  ""And where we don't, we most likely won't."",
  ""There won't be any material impact to our gross margin."",
  ""In general, Brian, you've given your thoughts on the gross margin profile for 2030, and we don't – AI is not going to going to change that."",
  ""So, it's more of a feeling when you're approaching a tipping point, it's a little bit different than being at the tipping point."",
  ""So, it's the level of depth of the customer conversations we're having in multiple large customers."",
  ""Every year, the legacy systems that they're using are aging a little bit."",
  ""And every year, our cloud-based solutions are getting better and they're getting more optimized and more people are using them."",
  ""And it's kind of like that."",
  ""You have a feeling that the tipping point is coming."",
  ""We've also filled out our suite."",
  ""We have our core safety processing application, which we've had some time."",
  ""But now, we have Safety Signal and Safety Workbench available."",
  ""Those are – so, those are things they need."",
  ""And in terms of what they're looking for is, A, they do want a cloud-based system because they don't – the idea of doing upgrades and taking changes and stuff is unappealing."",
  ""Lot of these systems are legacy and aging."",
  ""So, there's one just modernization."",
  ""But the second one is advanced automation."",
  ""Within the Safety System to do some things without manual intervention and then across systems, for example, between clinical data management and the Safety System, there's a lot of innovation that we can do because we have both sides of those applications."",
  ""So, they're looking for automation, not to take the people totally out of loop because the people have to be in the loop to know what's going on, so that they can care and notice and act appropriately, but to free them up from the redundant activities that they don't need to be doing."",
  ""Yes, I think, this level of uncertainty that we have in the macro is now what people are accustomed to now."",
  ""I guess, it could change, right, but we won't know if it's changing unless it does change."",
  ""So, they're just sort of settling in to getting work done."",
  ""Actually, COVID was not that long ago, and that was a real shock to the system, right?"",
  ""That was very, very not normal."",
  ""And then, the two conflicts that we had started, that was also very, very not normal."",
  ""But now, people are getting a little bit more used to these things, the highest interest rates right?"",
  ""For a while, the company have gotten used to very low interest rates."",
  ""Now, it's back to, okay, well, interest is not free anymore."",
  ""So, I don't want to call it really the new normal, but I guess it is the new normal."",
  ""I think really good execution by the Crossix team, some real innovation that they're doing, particularly in the audiences' area, with the micro audiences getting more fine-tuned."",
  ""Also, our data network is growing all the time."",
  ""We have our data network, we leverage that for Compass and Crossix."",
  ""So, our data network is getting more rich all the time as we add more data sources."",
  ""We have competition in those markets for sure."",
  ""I think, our competition has had some stumbles in the last year or two, and maybe made some promises that they couldn't deliver on."",
  ""Veeva tends to do well, right?"",
  ""When a new player comes into market, makes a lot of promises and then doesn't do well, that creates a tailwind for us."",
  ""So, I think, that's a positive."",
  ""Also, the integration with our CRM product, I think, is something that customers are noticing the integration with the rest of the CRM suite."",
  ""But overall, Crossix, the main driver of our strength, is not the main driver of our strength in Commercial, it's one of the drivers, but it's the CRM products, the Commercial content products, Compass had a good quarter, et cetera."",
  ""Crossix was, it was one of the wheels on the train."",
  ""I think that read of more comprehensive going at things is probably pretty particular to the Development Cloud area because that's where our suite is the most mature and most prudent."",
  ""But I would say in that area, yes, I wouldn't say dramatically more going fast and going all in, but a bit more than it was a year ago."",
  ""And the reasons for that are pretty mechanical because every year, if we deliver more products, more high quality products, we have one more year of track record of customer success, it's a reinforcement function and that gives us a lot of – that gives us a tailwind, but there's also a big responsibility."",
  ""So for example, when the CIO of Boehringer Ingelheim said to everybody at Veeva, you know that we go with Veeva because your stuff works and you deliver on what you said."",
  ""We take that pretty seriously, wow, that's a big responsibility."",
  ""So, we got to deliver what we said we're going to do."",
  ""So every year we do that, trust increases and trust is a business accelerator as it should be."",
  ""In terms of the new markets horizontal business applications, we're taking our platform specific approach there in terms of any update, and in terms of exactly what application area or customer segment, there's no specific timeline for that."",
  ""We'll just have to let that play out."",
  ""And we'll let you know when we have more information available."",
  ""Well, we – first, we just have to do the right thing by the customers, and that's about keeping lean teams, product excellence, delivering a lot of values and you see that in our financial profile, right?"",
  ""We spend almost twice as much in product as we do in sales and marketing."",
  ""So, that's really our focus being efficient."",
  ""And then for the horizontal business applications, I think it's not really that we need dollars to invest there."",
  ""It's really you need a small team and a Tiger team and a very focused team."",
  ""So yeah, we certainly have the capital to – all the cash flows that we would need to invest in the new market horizontal business applications."",
  ""With the additional revenue what we have coming in, mostly, we're going to put that into customer support and customer success and new products and filling out our existing products inside of life sciences."",
  ""So, that's basically the way to think about that."",
  ""The revenue in life sciences will really stay in life sciences."",
  ""That question, Paul, was the top 20 win, was that a new customer for us or an existing customer?"",
  ""Crossix is the one from Veeva that's most involved with direct-to-consumer advertising and some measurement and the audiences around that."",
  ""Now it's direct-to-consumer, but it's also to the healthcare providers as well."",
  ""So, it's not Crossix, is not only direct-to-consumer."",
  ""And Crossix has been performing well for us, but also what's been performing well for us is CRM and the add-ons, the commercial content and also our data products, Data Cloud, Veeva Link and Veeva Compass."",
  ""So in the commercial area, we've had pretty broad-based strength."",
  ""The CROs, they do make a lot of their revenue as associated with particular studies."",
  ""So, as a customer is planning a study and then they're deciding to go forward and then they're bidding out services and the CRO selects and wins the services, that's a long lag time until the CRO gets revenue and they get revenue from those studies over the next year, two years or even three years."",
  ""So, I would say a year or so ago, and two years ago and one year ago, there were more customers facing uncertainty and certainly smaller customers facing funding issues, and so they were stopping planned trials."",
  ""They don't usually stop the trials that were in flight."",
  ""So, they were maybe stopping some planned trials that would have turned into CRO revenue maybe this year."",
  ""So, that's maybe my best estimate of what you're seeing from the CROs."",
  ""Now, how does that affect Veeva?"",
  ""It doesn't really because most of our revenue is not on a study-by-study basis."",
  ""CRO is a good channel for us, and some of that is study-by-study."",
  ""For example, the EDC is study-by-study, standardization and trial supply management is study-by-study for us in the CROs."",
  ""But for example, our eTMF product and our CTMS product, those are long-term enterprise license agreements that are not affected by the ups and downs of study volumes."",
  ""So, we're not 100% insulated from the ups and downs in studies, but pretty darn close."",
  ""We're always looking for new data sources, and we look at that and we're patient when we evaluate things."",
  ""And when we see an opportunity to increase our data network, we'll take that if it's a reasonable opportunity."",
  ""So, Walgreens was a great partnership that we could have, and there's more of those we can do."",
  ""In terms of our competitive position with our data network, I think we have the strongest data network in the industry."",
  ""Remember that powers Compass and it also powers Crossix."",
  ""And it's a patient-first data network."",
  ""So, we're getting a lot of data that has to do with patient data, not just retail pharmacy data."",
  ""So, I feel really comfortable with where we're at and the number of data sources we have and the way we do the matching of the patient data across multiple sources in a very accurate way."",
  ""And that leads us to be able to make great products in both Compass in the measurement and audiences, but also in Crossix, but also in Compass for our patient product and our prescriber product."",
  ""Those are pretty disruptive products for the industry."",
  ""There's a way that they've been doing things for multiple years."",
  ""We're bringing out a bit of a disruptive way."",
  ""The change takes time, but every quarter, we're adding more customers and more customers for Compass patients and we've got a flywheel going there."",
  ""It's a little flywheel as right now, but it's spinning, and I'm very happy with it."",
  ""I think yes, it's a great environment for Veeva."",
  ""So, as we compare to a year ago, it's a bit better, but these are long-term capabilities, especially in the Development Cloud and with the larger customers, long-term capabilities that they're putting in."",
  ""So, it's not going to have dramatic ups and downs."",
  ""But what I'm encouraged about is the trains – these are big trains and they're moving."",
  ""And that's what we need to support our 2030 goals and our goals is to add more value to the industry overall."",
  ""I was really encouraged with the progress this last quarter."",
  ""I was encouraged and energized by the individual discussions that the Veeva team was having with Senior Executives, and that I was having with Senior Executives."",
  ""So, it was a good quarter."",
  ""Yeah, the re-platforming of Veeva CRM onto Vault CRM, very comfortable with that."",
  ""We announced it two years ago."",
  ""Of course, you're not comfortable with anything when you announced it two years ago."",
  ""You announced the plan and it's an audacious plan and you have to execute on it."",
  ""So, you better be paranoid at that time for obvious reasons, and we were."",
  ""We have live customers now."",
  ""We have so many of the product features that needed into the platform."",
  ""We've adapted the existing CRM product to where we need it."",
  ""And to now that full functionality as compared Vault CRM's co-functionality compared to Veeva CRM and we have these two new applications, Campaign Manager and Service Center."",
  ""So, it's definitely ready and we're really excited to have, if you would have told me two years ago, if you said, hey, here's where you'll be two years from now, I would be glad to take that in a heartbeat."",
  ""It means that the bears didn't come out to eat us, we got through the forest."",
  ""So, I'm very happy with that."",
  "", everyone, for joining the call today."",
  ""And  to our customers for your continued partnership and to the Veeva team for your outstanding work in the quarter."",
  ""So, I think, we're not going to get into the specific detailed billings information by product area."",
  ""But overall, within CDMS, I'd say it's playing out about as we expected."",
  ""Recall, a lot of the CDMS growth is predefined multiyear ramps, and so those are largely proceeding as expected."",
  ""And then, more broadly, in Q4 and generally, going forward, I think our growth in our billings are driven more by a broad base of products than any one product in particular."",
  ""Hey, Ken,  for the question."",
  ""So, I was at our Europe Summit event where we announced MLR Bot, something we've been thinking about and evaluating for some time."",
  ""We think we can help advance how our customers get their Commercial content approved and do that more efficiently."",
  ""That's what this is about, providing checks using GenAI to understand and provide insights as to what parts of the content they need to spend time on, and what parts of the content they can move very quickly with."",
  ""So, there's a lot of excitement."",
  ""This is a really core process for life sciences companies."",
  ""So, a lot of excitement there."",
  ""We are planning on – this will be a separate license."",
  ""It will be – the way to think about it is roughly an add-on to what we're providing in PromoMats."",
  ""And then, in terms of sizing and the monetization, we're still working through the details on that, but there's a ton of excitement from our existing customers."",
  ""We look forward to getting some early customers started on that as we go into next year."",
  ""I think, overall, really pleased with the execution from the team on both the subscription and the services side in the quarter."",
  ""We saw several projects complete or progress more quickly than we'd previously expected."",
  ""And so, that's the main driver of the beat on revenue and billings for services."",
  ""Yeah, I think you'll recall that the earlier part of the year, we had several different factors impacting performance, one of which was subcontractor revenue."",
  ""And so, I think, what we're seeing now is stabilizing of that base and pleased with the team's work in Q3 and as we look ahead."",
  ""Yeah, Peter, I'll take that one."",
  ""So, Brian,  for the question."",
  ""So, first, it's very early, right?"",
  ""There's still a lot of things that need to be settled out as it relates to the administration change."",
  ""Nominations need to be confirmed, priorities need to be established, all of that sort of stuff."",
  ""And our customers are accustomed to this, right?"",
  ""They've seen administration changes before they know that in some cases, there's some uncertainty and things may change in the future."",
  ""And what we see is, our customers are just focused on what they need to do."",
  ""They have priorities, they have work that needs to get done right now, and they're focused on that."",
  ""So, we're not really seeing any change in how customers are making decisions or how they're thinking about projects."",
  ""Remember, a lot of these projects that they have with us have been planned well in advance."",
  ""So, things are largely continuing as planned, and I think as things change, as things become reality, the industry will react accordingly."",
  ""But so far, it's business as usual."",
  ""This is Brian as well."",
  ""So, in Q3, I think, the revenue outperformance, roughly speaking, about half driven by the revenue beat and then a quarter driven by the timing of expenses and the quarter – remaining quarter driven by just continued expense discipline."",
  ""So, on those timing elements that you asked about, there's some things that we expected to hit in Q3 that will instead move into Q4 or into Q1."",
  ""And we always expect some variability there, but nothing specific."",
  "" for the question, Ryan."",
  ""First of all, the Boehringer Ingelheim announcement was super exciting."",
  ""You may have heard the fireside discussion I had with their CIO, Markus, talking about the innovation, what they have in front of them over the next five years or so in terms of product launches."",
  ""They're looking – they were looking for consistency, a partner that can execute."",
  ""They talked about that in that conversation."",
  ""You heard them saying that a lot of vendors promise a lot of things and Veeva is one that has consistently delivered for them over the long-term."",
  ""And that's not something to be taken for granted, right?"",
  ""So, it's really about execution and then, of course, the full innovation roadmap and where we're headed."",
  ""Did they do a thorough analysis?"",
  ""And all these customers are thinking deeply."",
  ""They all have their own process."",
  ""Every customer is a little bit different and unique."",
  ""Some customers will make decisions for different reasons."",
  ""So, you'll see different decision-making, but I would say, in some respects, they're thorough in their own ways, but these decisions are made by people, which means there's naturally differences in how they make decisions."",
  ""Peter, do you want to take that one?"",
  ""Hey, Dave,  for the question."",
  ""So, your question, actually, the way you framed it was interesting, right?"",
  ""There's a lot of ifs there, there's a lot of things that would actually have to happen for that to become a reality."",
  ""The nominations, the priorities, the policy, potentially, even legislation to make that happen."",
  ""So, it would be a lot to happen, but it'd certainly be a major change, right?"",
  ""And probably something that's challenged, right?"",
  ""Just the idea of changing access to patients' rights to information, for example, could become a barrier to that kind of thing happening."",
  ""So, a lot would have to happen, but – and I think it will likely be challenged."",
  ""In terms of what happens to our business, I think, this is the kind of thing that if it were enacted, it would take many, many years, because of it being challenged."",
  ""So, I don't expect any near-term impact on our business."",
  ""And I haven't seen our customers really reacting in any sort of negative way, even given some of the commentary that's been out there."",
  ""So, I think, it's kind of deal with it when it happens, and I think that's how our customers are thinking about it and focus on the near term."",
  ""So, I think your question is about seat count and as well as in core CRM also as it relates to the add-ons."",
  ""So, overall, the market's relatively stable."",
  ""So, over the last couple of years, you've heard us talk about some of the shifts in the dynamics as the industry has become a little more digital, we saw some reductions."",
  ""That has generally stabilized out."",
  ""So, although you may see individual companies adding or reducing their rep counts, on average, the industry is relatively stable."",
  ""So, I don't expect much change there."",
  ""As it relates to our add-on products, we continue to make progress there, meaning the attach rates become higher."",
  ""As every quarter goes on, we tend to increase our attach rates with some of those products."",
  ""Some have higher attach rates, others still have more room to grow."",
  ""So, that's the way to think about it."",
  ""I think, it'll be relatively stable over the next couple of years, as it relates to a market perspective."",
  ""I think, the market's at a new steady state."",
  ""Yes, so, learnings, well, there's a significant difference from where we were two years ago to where we are today."",
  ""Two years ago, it was really – it was an idea."",
  ""What we had, our idea and our strategy was just being formed, and to where we are today is a kind of remarkable difference in terms of what we've been able to achieve."",
  ""Now, a product and market that's at full functionality, we have our first early migrations, which are planned to be live or the technical go lives going happening this year, and then some big migrations happening next year."",
  ""So, we've learned a lot, I would say, around the migration tooling."",
  ""We've built the migration tooling and now, we have confidence that we know what that needs to do."",
  ""We know – you always find things as you go along, right?"",
  ""You learn as you go along, and we found things that didn't work and we fixed it."",
  ""And now, the migration is – migration tooling and technology is in a good place."",
  ""We've learned ways to help make it even more disruptive or even less disruptive for customers."",
  ""So, I think, we feel really good about that."",
  ""And then, I think, maybe the third thing is just thinking about, particularly for small and mid-sized customers, how they're able to really take advantage of that move to Vault CRM very quickly and then turning on some of this new innovation very fast."",
  ""Some of our new products, like Service Center, Campaign Manager, and then over time, the areas like the connectivity with Vault PromoMats, the integration with, the tighter connectivity with things like Microsoft and Teams and Outlook and everything else."",
  ""So, we've learned a lot and we're executing better and we get better and better each quarter that goes on."",
  ""Hey Brent,  for the question."",
  ""It's a nice start certainly, but really a testament to the great execution from the Veeva team."",
  ""More than half of that outperformance on the margin, as I mentioned is due to the revenue side."",
  ""And so that's outstanding execution across our sales team, our services teams, the product teams, the team is working to create value for our customers every day."",
  ""So, we're continuing to be really pleased with the execution on that front."",
  ""And then as far as the second part of your question around our philosophy, around cost management, no real change that I'd say to that philosophy."",
  ""We think about managing costs on a period-by-period basis."",
  ""We make investments in growth as we feel we need to."",
  ""And there happened to be a few expenses this quarter that moved out to other quarters and then that ongoing cost discipline that you've heard from us in the past."",
  ""So, overall, strong execution from the team on both the top and the bottom line."",
  ""First, we're excited about where we are."",
  ""We got our fourth top 20 commitment."",
  ""We're pleased with the progress there."",
  ""I do continue to expect additional commitments over the next several months."",
  ""Yeah, I mean, it's a significant advantage having a real product, right?"",
  ""Having a product in the market, we have customers live."",
  ""We have customers migrating to it."",
  ""We're innovating in the product in many different ways."",
  ""And I got to hear a lot about that innovation."",
  ""Our customers' reaction to that innovation in person and at our Customer Summit event, everything from what Peter talked about, sales, marketing and medical in a single Vault, that's foundationally different."",
  ""Our AI strategy, we talked about how we're executing well against that."",
  ""So, in a sense, I would say, yeah, each deal that we have, we make a little more progress."",
  ""But certainly, I would also kind of balance that with every customer is a little bit different, they optimize for different things."",
  ""We're certainly not going to win every deal."",
  ""But we still expect to win the vast majority of the deals that are out there."",
  ""And we're pleased with kind of where things stand and the progress we're making so far in top 20 and beyond."",
  ""So, as Peter covered, I think we've got probably a little bit better visibility to next year, marginally speaking, than prior years."",
  ""But we're not giving FY 2026 guidance at this time."",
  ""We'll do that after the Q4 results."",
  ""Overall, for the year, our updated guidance reflects subscription growth of about 15%, so really pleased with that growth rate against our long-term growth targets."",
  ""Hey, Craig, this is Brian."",
  ""So, I think as with the revenue guidance, we won't give specific guidance on services revenue until after our Q4 results, but happy with how the team are continuing to execute and the momentum we saw coming out of Q3."",
  ""Yeah, I mean, it's certainly in our larger customers they're in the vast majority of our customers having conversations."",
  ""And that's no surprise, right?"",
  ""That's not something we – where we are surprised about, we've expected to see that."",
  ""In terms of – are they showing up more frequently?"",
  ""I don't know that there's a change there."",
  ""We certainly still see them in the market."",
  ""I think as I alluded to before, IQVIA is out of the game, their product sunset."",
  ""They don't have a product yet."",
  ""So, that's really who is – who the primary competitor is at this point."",
  ""So, on the TFC side, just recall that's predominantly a revenue side normalization."",
  ""So, it impacts the margins a bit."",
  ""But I think we are certainly excited to jump into next year and to stop having both normalized for TFC and non-normalized for TFC results to report."",
  ""On the revenue side, it impacted the growth rate year-over-year by about 2%."",
  ""Yeah, Jailendra, so let me take that second part first around migration."",
  ""I would say it varies pretty significantly by the size and complexity of the customer."",
  ""If you were a top 20 customer, it's likely very, very different than a small or mid-sized customer."",
  ""A small customer may be migrated in, let's say four weeks or six weeks."",
  ""And then as you expand up to a top 20, that can take closer to two years, right?"",
  ""So, we see that difference in terms of their timing, when they make a commitment."",
  ""The commitment depends on their timeframe."",
  ""We're not doing anything unnatural to try to force a commitment and there's a lot of things that they have to think about."",
  ""What's happening in their own business, the timing of, let's say, the launches that they have, should they do the migration before a launch or after a launch?"",
  ""So, those kinds of things come into play."",
  ""So each customer is a little bit different."",
  ""They optimize for slightly different things."",
  ""But, our strategy is to make this minimally disruptive and as easy as possible to get them to a decision, but also to the migration."",
  ""So, the top 20 that we just announced was an existing customer."",
  ""So that was, I think you're referring to the Boehringer Ingelheim announcement."",
  ""Is that what you're referring to, Jailendra?"",
  ""Yeah, so Boehringer Ingelheim has been a very long-term customer for Veeva in commercial."",
  ""And then over the last several years, last couple of years in R&D also, we've worked very closely with them and the commercial side made them successful with Veeva CRM and they're putting their trust in us for Vault CRM for the long-term."",
  ""So, we were happy to see head count increase in the quarter."",
  ""We're continuing to make investments in growth."",
  ""But certainly in our product areas is a key focus as we look ahead to next year and something we're pleased with the execution around the hiring of."",
  ""There is some secular change in gross margins as we look out, but these recall are pretty long range migrations."",
  ""There's still a long time to go in the Vault migration story, both the decisions that customers are making as well as their migration away from Veeva CRM on the Salesforce platform towards Vault CRM on the Vault platform."",
  ""And so, that adjustment, that shift to margins over time, that improvement will take some time for you to see in the results and really spread out between now and 2030."",
  ""So, I think it was – it might have been 13, if I remember the exact number correctly."",
  ""But yeah, we see roughly that amount in the quarter."",
  ""In fact, I think it was 13 exactly, we see roughly that amount each quarter."",
  ""Think about it as these are companies most likely that are choosing And we're winning virtually all of those deals that are out there, and that's the – that's super exciting for us, and a lot of these customers will continue to grow and expand as they go from their pre-commercial stage into something that's commercial and even larger."",
  ""But yeah, we're winning – our win rate is very, very high."",
  ""We won't get into specific product level growth rates."",
  ""But overall, pleased with how the Crossix team has performed this year and executed against the market opportunity."",
  ""It's a really strong and healthy growing market, and we're continuing to take share in that and something we hope to continue going forward."",
  ""Hey, Steven, let me take the first question, and I'll turn it over to Brian to talk a little bit about CRO revenue and what percent that is."",
  ""Clinical trial starts, yeah, we certainly pay attention to that."",
  ""It's one metric of many."",
  ""But I just cautioned you from over-indexing on any single metric."",
  ""We certainly don't do that."",
  ""And you heard Peter talk a little bit about how we're insulated from some of the near-term changes in clinical trial volumes as an example."",
  ""So, we don't over-index there."",
  ""Obviously, over the long-term that matters and the near-term it's not so important because most of our deals and our customers buying patterns are more for enterprise capabilities than they are for clinical trial starts."",
  ""So yeah, we pay attention, but not a single metric as the most important."",
  ""I'll turn it over to Brian to talk a little about- to answer your second question on CRO revenue."",
  ""So, on the second part of your question around CRO revenue, specifically, at Investor Day, as you saw, we embedded the CRO channel within top 20 enterprise and SMB."",
  ""So, it's a little bit harder for the year-over-year comparison, but the last time we disclosed that it was about 5% of revenue and it's not materially changed from that.""

  "", everyone, for joining us today."",
  ""We are proud of the operational and financial results we achieved this quarter and excited by our momentum heading into next year."",
  ""We continue to deliver against our core strategy and make progress towards our key milestones of revenue growth, profitability and technology integration."",
  ""Our diligence and focus on execution drove revenue growth of 108% while also reducing costs."",
  ""This revenue was driven by delivery of a company record of 74 e-propulsion systems to blue-chip OEM customers, 106% increase over our Q2 2024 results."",
  ""While we still have a way to go, we are moving closer to the future we all envision."",
  ""I'm going to take a little bit to talk about where we're living today."",
  ""We are living in an era where electrification is the now."",
  ""But the world is still grappling with this transition and the mass adoption of electric vehicles."",
  ""From grid inadequacies to electric vehicle adoption, the quest for energy efficiency is paramount."",
  ""The barriers to electrification are many, but we can group them really into three key buckets that continue to challenge everyone, including Exro in the industry."",
  ""From large legacy OEMs to emerging companies like ours, to motivated fleet owners that want to go green, these are some of the top challenges."",
  ""Cost, commercial vehicles are company assets."",
  ""They are needed to deliver and aid company's business outcomes."",
  ""Beyond being energy efficient, these trucks need to have a total cost of ownership that makes sense."",
  ""Within the passenger vehicle sector, the reasons are slightly different, but cost still remains the issue."",
  ""This is a key challenge that we see OEMs striving for, trying to get to profitability, to vehicle platforms that are affordable, with most global passenger automotive OEMs trying to aim for sub CAD 25,000 price point."",
  ""Later, Darrell will delve into issues like this, the cost, and will discuss how our success is continuing to drive down costs on a unit level without compromising performance."",
  ""Now, going beyond the driving itself, but being able to achieve the outcome that's needed of that vehicle, a garbage truck that can pick up the same number of routes or an urban delivery truck that can tackle the heavy, bulky loads with the same ease as intercity light loads; the variability of driving conditions and in particular fleet routes needs to be considered."",
  ""This is how we at Exro talk about performance."",
  ""There is no single solution as everyone drives differently."",
  ""From the roads we climb on to the weather we navigate, the ability to tackle all conditions is how we achieve true mass adoption."",
  ""Now, I know when we all think about range, we think about range anxiety, charging stations, but that is actually progressing in the right direction."",
  ""There is a lot of work left to do, but we are overcoming that."",
  ""We have many more chargers across North America today than just a year ago."",
  ""But in fleets there is still some work to go from a charging position and we need to think about that impact on our grid and what we're going to face in the months and years to come."",
  ""Central to the electric transformation is innovation, and in particular, innovation in power electronics."",
  ""It is through power electronics that we control electrical energy and energy efficiency."",
  ""This capability is where Exro shines."",
  ""Our technology optimizes electric vehicle propulsion systems by expanding their capabilities of electric motors and batteries, which are two of the foundational elements of the electric transition."",
  ""With our innovative technology, we have demonstrated that we can achieve performance without compromising price."",
  ""Exro patented technologies provide the solution to achieving powertrains with less complex systems that can deliver unprecedented real world driving and cost effective solutions."",
  ""Our system utilizes power electronics to bring fast charging onboard the vehicle inside the inverter itself."",
  ""The end result is charging infrastructure costs that are 10% to 20% of the cost of the DC fast charging stations in the market today."",
  ""Our technology demonstrates the difference that real innovation makes."",
  ""The transition to electrification is underway, and innovation is the key to our future."",
  ""While we are proud of our progress and the accomplishments, we believe that there is still a significant potential to drive further improvements in both performance and cost efficiency."",
  ""So now let's dig into our Q3 financial performance."",
  ""The past six months have been dedicated to execution on our core pillars that were part of our strategy for merging with SEA Electric in April of this year."",
  ""I'm going to spend a few minutes discussing where we stand with each of those core pillars and why we are proud of the progress."",
  ""Our first pillar was around consistent growth and how we demonstrate building that foundation towards that growth."",
  ""In Q3, we were able to deliver 74 The second core pillar is our path to profitability."",
  ""Delivering a record number of systems to top OEMs is not an easy task."",
  ""Our team not only delivered but also drove substantial cost savings that exceeded our initial goal of bill of material cost reductions of 5%."",
  ""We have achieved over 18% savings on our systems since April 5 and remain focused on our path to profitability."",
  ""As we talked about at the start of today's call, this is a core objective as this is key to the transition is performance without compromising price."",
  ""Innovating great technology is hard, but innovating great technology that is affordable is exponentially harder."",
  ""Exro has long been committed to innovating while growing revenue and achieving profitability."",
  ""Now, as we continue with full commercialization, we are focusing on programs that have visibility to profitability."",
  ""Darrell's going to discuss our progress in more detail, but I will note that we improved our unit cost of goods sold by more than 20% over last quarter."",
  ""And finally, our technology disruption, as I said, innovation is the answer to an electrified future."",
  ""Regardless of the sector, passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, the answer lies in our ability to deliver solutions that solve our customers' challenges, improved energy efficiency and performance while driving down costs."",
  ""Our patented technology has been integrated with our OEM partners and it continues to progress."",
  ""We not only are able to produce more systems at a lower cost, but we're improving the technology as well."",
  ""The integration of our Coil Driver into all Exro propulsion systems remains on track for second half of 2025."",
  ""We will provide more detail on our technology roadmap tomorrow at our inaugural Analyst Day."",
  ""Before turning it over to Darrell to go through our financial summary, let's go over an operational update."",
  ""I wanted to take a minute to address some items as we continue to progress and evolve our organization."",
  ""To do this, I'm going to walk through our progress from April when we closed the merger until now."",
  ""At the time of closing, we had five strategic goals for 2024."",
  ""The first was delivering on 250 units in our first six months post closed."",
  ""In Q2, we discussed certain integration challenges and their impact on our business and forecast."",
  ""We have worked hard to overcome these challenges."",
  ""And while we cannot make-up these units in the short term, our performance in Q3 should speak for itself in our commitment to delivering consistent quarter-over-quarter growth."",
  ""With year-to-date revenue of CAD 16.3 million and after six months of execution, we are now delivering against orders, backlog and future demand."",
  ""The second was our cost savings of 20% across the business."",
  ""Again, we've long been committed to the foundational processes and systems that deliver efficiency and operational execution."",
  ""These initiatives are not always visible externally, but they are the foundation of how we've been able to overcome many of the challenges post-merger."",
  ""These behind-the-scene efforts have allowed us to recognize on a quarterly basis the growth that we've seen quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""They will become more evident as we continue to progress the business."",
  ""The third was our first joint integration."",
  ""Our Hino platform was committed as our first integration partner, which we announced in August."",
  ""This work continues to progress and we are pleased to announce that the vehicle is onsite here in Mesa for our Analyst Day tomorrow with Coil Driver inside that allows featured Exro patented charging solution."",
  ""Our guys have enjoyed being out and driving the vehicle today and really being able to not only see the Coil Driver, but see it charging and really in full position."",
  ""In addition to our Hino integration, we have targeted a Mack integration for the fourth quarter, which remains on track."",
  ""Supply chain efficiencies was a 5% reduction in bill of material."",
  ""This was one of our big steps forward."",
  ""It was an aggressive challenge, although it may not seem that way with 5%."",
  ""We continue to make progress on our efforts to reduce costs."",
  ""We've focused to reaching this profitability target and with the support of our partners, we exceeded our expectations and delivered over 18% reduction in our bill of material in the past six months."",
  ""We'll provide more detail on this goal at our Analyst Day tomorrow."",
  ""These cost outs have been driven by strategic sourcing within our supply chain, efficient ordering and efficient logistics."",
  ""And finally, our new innovation program, the Stellantis program announced in late Q3, provides a monumental step forward in our developments in the passenger vehicle segment."",
  ""This program has pushed us to develop our cost position and improved performance without compromising price."",
  ""As we develop our work within the passenger vehicle segment, we continue to stay on focus with our two key partnerships in mid and late stage discussions and have an additional partnership in commercial trucking that is progressing through commercialization as well."",
  ""These top pipeline positionings are progressing as we had hoped for this time of year."",
  ""Overall, while we recognize the frustrations experienced over the past year, I'd like to take a moment to say  to our shareholders and to remind all of our stakeholders that we cannot control the pace of the broader transition, but we can control the aspects within our reach."",
  ""Our patented technology is fully de-risked, is demonstrating best-in-class performance and is integrated into top OEMs in electrification."",
  ""We continue to control our cost, developing ongoing cost reductions and we control the partnerships we select in which we enter into, ensuring we collaborate with market leaders who share our commitment to excellence."",
  ""I recognize all of the challenges and I acknowledge the misses that we've experienced."",
  ""However, our vision of being best-in-class supplier for power electronics remains the same."",
  ""We are ready to scale and grow alongside the ongoing transition."",
  ""And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Darrell."",
  ""Sorry about that little mix up there."",
  ""I thought my voice had went off on my phone there, so I apologize."",
  ""First off, I want to say  to all of the Exro team for your dedication to our progress."",
  ""Tomorrow marks our first inaugural Analyst Day in Mesa, where we will launch our integrated Coil Driver propulsion system with a ride-and-drive event that allows the opportunity to see the differentiation firsthand, and we will provide guidance towards our 2025 business plan."",
  "" to all of our shareholders for all of your continued support."",
  ""And with that, I'll open it up for questions."",
  ""Today, we will discuss our performance of the third quarter, followed by a Q&A session."",
  ""Joining us today are Sue Ozdemir, our CEO; and Darrell Bishop, our CFO."",
  ""During this call, we will make forward-looking statements."",
  ""Actual results could differ from those expressed or implied."",
  ""We undertake no obligation to update or revise any of these statements."",
  ""Relevant factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements are listed in our MD&A for the quarter that ended September 30, 2024, which can be found on In addition, during the call, we may refer to specific non-IFRS measures."",
  ""These measures are also reconciliation of non-IFRS measures to the most directly comparable IFRS measures."",
  ""Management believes these non-IFRS measures provide useful information to investors regarding the corporation's financial condition and results of operations as they provide additional metrics and performance."",
  ""These non-IFRS measures are not recognized under IFRS, do not have any standardized meaning prescribed under IFRS and may differ from similarly named measures reported by other issuers."",
  ""Accordingly, they may not be comparable."",
  ""These measures should not be considered as a substitute for related financial information prepared under IFRS."",
  ""With that, I will now turn over our call to our CEO, Sue Ozdemir."",
  ""Nothing like a live event here."",
  ""As we dive into the financial aspects of the quarter, want to ground everyone and that the story around the quarter is that we demonstrated a steady improvement over Q2."",
  ""So first, we are beginning to recognize the benefits of the SEA Electric acquisition that closed in April of this year."",
  ""Second, our operations are beginning to stabilize."",
  ""And third, we continue to drive down costs to demonstrate a focus on profitability."",
  ""As Sue highlighted, in Q3, we achieved a record revenue milestone of CAD 11 million, more than double the CAD 5.3 million posted in Q2."",
  ""This revenue was primarily recognized from the delivery of 74 electric propulsion systems to OEMs during the quarter, a more than twofold increase on a sequential basis."",
  ""Importantly, we also demonstrated our ability to drive down costs on our bill of material and across the business."",
  ""We were able to achieve these results while also addressing the many challenges to our supply chain, which we highlighted on our Q2 ."",
  ""In Q3, we successfully reduced costs on a per unit basis while also doubling our deliveries."",
  ""Our cost of goods sold for the quarter was CAD 12.6 million, resulting in a gross profit/loss, excluding a non-cash provision for inventory, of CAD 1.7 million."",
  ""This is compared to CAD 2.7 million loss in Q2."",
  ""On a per unit basis, cost decreased by approximately 20% quarter-over-quarter as we improved supply chain efficiency, we minimized airfreighting of materials and ensured one time – on-time delivery of parts."",
  ""We continue to drive down that bill of materials as Sue highlighted, and we are targeting an additional 20% reduction by the end of Q2 2025."",
  ""Turning to notable operating expenses, payroll and SG&A accounted for CAD 8.1 million and CAD 3.4 million respectively, showing reductions of 7% and 35% quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""Following the close of Q3, we implemented additional cost cutting measures, which included further reductions in payroll and SG&A as part of our ongoing efforts to streamline operations."",
  ""Since April 5, we have reduced our head count by approximately 35% and annual payroll by more than $10 million."",
  ""Other items worth noting, accounts payable stood at CAD 31.3 million at the end of the quarter, which was up slightly from just over CAD 29 million in Q2 as we continued to work through the legacy SEA acquisition payable in conjunction with ramping up our working capital purchases to support the growth that you saw in Q4 and going into 2025."",
  ""Offsetting this was an inventory value of CAD 27.9 million, down from CAD 32 million in Q2 as we advanced the conversion of inventory into revenue in Q3."",
  ""The main components of this inventory at September 30 included raw materials, which were valued at just over CAD 20 million."",
  ""This includes batteries, motors, the components that make-up our e-propulsion system in addition to a work-in-progress inventory of CAD 7.1 million."",
  ""Moving to goodwill and intangibles, now given the decline in our share price through Q3 and the decreased volume outlook since April 5, we were obligated by accounting standards to complete an impairment test."",
  ""This test resulted in a write-down of all goodwill and a portion of intangible assets related to the SEA Electric acquisition."",
  ""This is a CAD 211 million non-cash adjustment to the carrying value of these assets."",
  ""From a cash perspective, we closed the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of – just of CAD 14.0 million."",
  ""This was supported by a CAD 25 million equity financing, which we completed in Q3, which was backed predominantly by existing shareholders who are aligned with our long term vision."",
  ""As we continue our path to profitability, we are also actively engaged to secure additional non-dilutive capital."",
  ""We believe our execution in Q3 has positioned us well to secure the necessary bridge to profitability with the goal of achieving self-sustainability in the second half of 2025."",
  ""Want to take a few minutes to further highlight that path to profitability."",
  ""I want to emphasize that we remain laser focused on our revenue growth in parallel with our cost out efforts."",
  ""I just want to dive into the progress that we've made on a couple of key initiatives."",
  ""First, our bill of material cost reductions."",
  ""As Sue highlighted, when we closed the acquisition of SEA Electric in April, we were targeting a 5% reduction in our bill of material on our propulsion systems for 2024."",
  ""Building on the progress made in Q2, the team continued to drive down costs and implement continuous improvements."",
  ""As a result, we've achieved more than 18% in savings on our bill of material and are on track to further exceed our 2024 goals through Q4."",
  ""In the first six months, we've achieved roughly $15 million in annualized savings against the 2024 target of $10 million."",
  ""These cost reductions have been primarily driven by head count reductions, facilities optimization and operational efficiencies."",
  ""While much of these savings are annualized, they underscore the strength of our CapEx-like business model and are focused on efficient processes and supply chain management."",
  ""Third would be design evolution."",
  ""We continue to make progress in R&D. While we've seen success in reducing costs, it has been driven by the foundational work we've done over the past few years."",
  ""Our initial mission, which was set five years ago, was to build a technology platform that was both scalable and flexible."",
  ""Our current R&D spend, alongside partnerships with world-class OEMs like Stellantis, Mack, Linamar and Hino and others, position us for continued innovation and cost reduction."",
  ""And this all coincides with our plan to continue to demonstrate quarter-over-quarter growth in deliveries of our technologies with blue-chip OEM customers through efficient execution."",
  ""Before I turn it back to Sue and we open it up for questions, I just want to echo Sue's sentiment that innovation is the key to our electrified future."",
  ""Over the first six months after we closed the merger, our organization has undergone a transformational shift, overcoming numerous challenges and delivering record results quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""While the journey thus far has not been without its hurdles, we are making progress in the key drivers of our business, consistent growth, cost reduction and a clearer path to cash flow profitability."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it back over to Sue for some closing remarks and questions.""
]","[
  ""So just I guess the first question is just looking at kind of production rates and the ramp."",
  ""I think, Sue, as you talked about, initial expectations Okay."",
  ""And then just maybe thinking about the SEA write-down, and I appreciate there was some accounting requirements in this, but in going through the notes and thinking about what it kind of implies about kind of longer term revenue growth from SEA, can you maybe address kind of puts and takes around the combination and what's really changed in the expectations since you've done the transaction?"",
  ""And as well, I'm sure we're going to get this question, but in terms of the compensation that Exro provided to SEA, is there anything that offsets some of those changes even at this point?"",
  ""And then just one quick question just – and I appreciate getting more detail."",
  ""But you had it in previous quarters and even as part of the combination, talked about doing kind of a reverse split All right."",
  ""I look forward to seeing you guys tomorrow."",
  ""I'll pass over the line."",
  ""I was curious for sure, Darrell, kind of the trajectory of those 74 systems throughout the quarter or even better if you have anything post quarter in terms of the shipment cadence."",
  ""Just wondering either the distribution of those shipments throughout the quarter, was there kind of an accelerating pace maybe exiting into September and maybe how shipments have trended into Q4?"",
  ""Anything along those lines that you could share would be great."",
  ""And for my follow-up, on the cost side of things, appreciate all the efforts you guys have made on that front."",
  ""Would you say Q3 OpEx is kind of a good representation of where you guys would like to keep things going forward or have there been some either cuts made in the quarter that you didn't get a full benefit from or anything kind of forthcoming that can further benefit the OpEx side of things?"",
  ""Yeah, sure, Chris, and tomorrow we'll be providing kind of the details around it."",
  ""But what I would say is the software issues have been fully dealt with."",
  ""There are not any type of barrier for us right now, and we continue to see that growth continuing into the quarters to come."",
  ""We're well setup right now."",
  ""We're expecting shipments in – to continue to set us up through the first quarter, and we see that ability to continue to grow quarter-over-quarter."",
  "", Jeff, and great question."",
  ""So, yeah, there's definitely kind of an acceleration."",
  ""I would say we're not quite at that full ramp of week over week exactly growth but I would say you definitely see the ramp month over month, where we kind of came out stronger at the end of the month as those efficiencies really started to take effect, and kind of inventory started to catch up with supply chain and kind of really positioned us well as we go into the fourth quarter."",
  ""So that's – we're navigating that but from a delivery and execution perspective, we're really well set up coming out of the quarter and expect that ramp to continue week over week."",
  ""And Chris (sic) [Jeff] (00:31:22), I'll add on a little bit on that one just to say, it kind of goes to what we were talking about with the foundational systems that we have in place and that ability to get more efficient as we go."",
  ""So as we continue to ramp where a lot of companies have to do the investment at that point, that's the investments that we've made over the past years that we're now recognizing."",
  ""And so we can do those cost reductions but still ramp up the units that we need to do."",
  ""So  once again to our shareholders."",
  ""Keep an eye on our website on our Investor Center."",
  ""We will be sharing all the highlights of our Analyst Day tomorrow."",
  ""And we look forward to having everybody enjoy in our guidance and our innovation."",
  ""Maybe I'll jump in a little bit on the impairment first, Chris."",
  ""I think you kind of hit it with the beginning part of your question in terms of this – I want to identify this as a non-cash write-down in goodwill and intangible assets."",
  ""A lot of it was driven by the share price, the depreciation that we've seen as well as the forecasts that we're lower today than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year, when we announced the merger with SEA Electric."",
  ""We'll give some additional color to that tomorrow when we go through the guidance and the outlook on the Analyst Day."",
  ""But for the most part, this was driven by – the bigger part of it would have been the depreciation of our share price from approximately CAD 1 a share when we announced the acquisition of SEA Electric earlier this year, and we are around CAD 0.85 on April 5 when we closed."",
  ""And at the end of the quarter, we were sub CAD 0.30 a share and so that would have been the bigger driver in there."",
  ""I think it's always something that's been out there, Chris."",
  ""I would say it's not a topic of conversation right now and anything that we're speaking with from a board level and a management perspective."",
  ""To be quite frank, we are laser focused on the operations, we are focused on rebuilding the value that we see and I think that we're starting to recognize from the execution within the business and kind of really put our head down on making sense of that first."",
  ""Yeah, great question, Chris (sic) [Jeff] (00:30:34)."",
  ""I would say, we are continuing our cost out efforts across the business, including OpEx."",
  ""When you look at the payroll numbers quarter-over-quarter, we made some progress there."",
  ""There were some additional cuts that were made subsequent to the quarter through the month of October that you will see pay – that you will see play out with our Q4 results and certainly on an annualized basis as we look into 2025."",
  ""Now when we are optimizing the business from that perspective, of course, that plays over into an SG&A perspective, as well your direct head count impact from an SG&A standpoint and so, we would anticipate to see that – those costs continue to decrease across the business.""

3132787,00FZJZ-E,2024-12-05,"[
  ""For our second quarter, we reported net sales of $1.47 billion, which increased 3.5% year-over-year, primarily the result of recent acquisitions, with volume growth in Ceilings, Steel Framing and Complementary Products."",
  ""Softened conditions across our end markets, together with the impacts from two major hurricanes held back our Wallboard volumes and our results in general for the quarter, causing the closure of more than 40 of our locations for at least one day during the quarter, plus subsequent slowdowns and disruption in construction activity in the hardest hit areas as the local focus turned to clean up and recovery."",
  ""We estimate that hurricanes Helene and Milton negatively impacted our net sales and organic sales in the quarter by approximately $20 million and adjusted EBITDA by approximately $6 million inclusive of lost purchasing leverage and operational inefficiencies impacting SG&A. Organic sales for the quarter declined by 4.6% due to the hurricanes and to softening year-over-year demand, particularly in our multi-family and commercial end markets."",
  ""Gross margin for the quarter was 31.4%, up 20 basis points sequentially from our fiscal first quarter, but down 90 basis points from a year ago."",
  ""This variance from last fall can largely be attributed to a mix shift from commercial and multi-family to single-family deliveries combined with price and cost dynamics in Wallboard as our team continued to work during the quarter to pass through previously announced manufacturer price increases in a very competitive and cost sensitive environment."",
  ""Net income for the quarter was $53.5 million, compared to $81 million a year ago, and adjusted EBITDA was $152.2 million compared to $167.6 million in the prior year quarter."",
  ""Given this softer market environment and amid the storm disruption, EBITDA margin was 10.3% for our second quarter, compared with 11.8% a year ago, when both the multi-family and commercial end markets were much more active."",
  ""The trends that we discussed on last quarter's call have continued to impact the industry at large."",
  ""Although public sector project, data centers and other projects backed or influenced by government incentive programs such as the CHIPS and Inflation Reduction Acts continued, overall, commercial activity levels were lower than a year ago and are expected to remain challenged until the interest rate and lending backdrop improves."",
  ""In multi-family, high interest rates and suppressed commercial real estate lending also continue to constrain activity in the near term."",
  ""However, solid absorption rates of recently completed units in the space provide optimism for renewed investment."",
  ""Given the development cycle for these projects, however, the ramp up will take some time."",
  ""For the longer term, the solid underlying demand fundamentals of the housing market, including favorable demographics, low levels of supply of new homes, a chronic undersupply of homes in general, and easing regulatory constraints for development are expected to provide considerable support for the multi-family market over time."",
  ""For single-family affordability issues driven by sustained high mortgage rates and low resale inventory have muted its recovery."",
  ""It is particularly difficult for smaller builders who are already relatively challenged in terms of land acquisition, lack the balance sheets and scale to buy down rates and offer other homebuyer incentives common in today's market."",
  ""Overall, single-family activity during the quarter was roughly flat with a year ago, but with a continuing shift to larger builders."",
  ""We believe that we will see improvement in this end market once mortgage rates recede, as there continues to be significant pent-up demand for housing."",
  ""Ramping Expansionary sentiment for zoning improvement in local markets should also have a positive influence, both single and multi-family."",
  ""As we noted last quarter, all of these favorable influences should help to trigger eventual recovery in all of our end markets, led first by single-family, then followed by commercial and multi-family."",
  ""Against this backdrop, our diversified customer base and balanced revenue mix continue to serve GMS well, as we can nimbly flex up or down as our end markets fluctuate."",
  ""In addition, where large national homebuilders now account for more than half of all new home sales, GMS is very well-positioned to serve this demand with our distinct footprint, equipment, expertise and scale."",
  ""Taken together, these factors provide us with a great deal of confidence for the long-term prospects of GMS."",
  ""I'd like to thank our dedicated team for their unwavering commitment to position GMS for success, especially when faced with market and operational challenges like the weather events that affected our business in the southern regions this fall."",
  ""As we manage through the continued macro dynamics impacting our industry, the efforts that our team have made to execute against our four strategic pillars are key in maintaining our position as the supplier of choice for our customers."",
  ""These pillars are highlighted on slide 4."",
  ""Even as demand has further muted, we maintained our focus on growing or maintaining our share across our core product categories throughout the second quarter."",
  ""For Wallboard, despite being significantly impacted by pricing headwinds in multi-family and commercial, our teams continue to stay close to customers across our end markets, particularly as we work through the quarter to manage through the manufacturer price increases announced in early calendar 2024."",
  ""Using the Gypsum Association disclosures for the calendar third quarter, our share grew slightly year-over-year."",
  ""In Steel Framing and Ceilings where our teams have been working to drive sales in data centers and other large commercial projects, our share also expanded year-over-year for information provided by the Steel Framing Industry Association and manufacturer disclosures through September."",
  ""Data centers represent a growing and attractive opportunity for GMS in many cases demanding higher end Ceilings products, Steel Framing, Wallboard and Complementary Products, as well as specialized service and delivery."",
  ""Next, we continue to prioritize growth in our Complementary Products."",
  ""As we've discussed on previous calls, we are focused on expanding high opportunity growth subcategories, including Tools & Fasteners, EIFS and Stucco and insulation."",
  ""The Complementary Products category continues to grow faster than our core products and these three focus areas within the category have even stronger growth rates."",
  ""We believe that driving solid growth in Complementary Products beyond that of our core products will over time increase the value we bring to our customers while also enabling accelerated growth and margin enhancement."",
  ""During the quarter, we expanded our platform to the recent openings of one new greenfield location, plus two more in November to enhance our service levels in existing markets, complemented by the exciting acquisition of exterior product specialist, R.S. Elliott in Florida."",
  ""Our M&A expertise is one of our core competencies."",
  ""Since COVID, we have invested just over $1 billion to acquire 16 companies that generated approximately $1 billion of total annualized net sales and roughly $140 million in annualized adjusted EBITDA at the time of the deal closures."",
  ""Six of these transactions were focused on the expansion of our core products, while 10 primarily helped us accelerate our Complementary Products initiatives, including those focused on EIFS and Stucco and Tools & Fasteners in the US, together with adding broadened offerings and scale to the one-stop, more broad-line model in place in Canada."",
  ""Finally, we continue to make progress to drive improved productivity and profitability."",
  ""Our team worked diligently during the quarter to implement the cost savings initiatives we announced in August, which we now believe we'll achieve closer to $30 million of annualized cost savings for the company."",
  ""These results are realized through simplification and efficiency optimization, which were made possible by our prior investments in technology and other process improvements and structural changes."",
  ""On a run rate basis, we achieved roughly half of the $30 million annualized savings in the second quarter and expect the remainder of the pacing to be realized in the third quarter."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Scott."",
  ""While near-term market conditions continue to present headwinds, GMS is well-positioned given our expertise, flexibility and scale to successfully service both commercial and residential customers."",
  ""Given all of the evolving market dynamics, we believe the conditions will remain choppy and unpredictable into calendar year 2025."",
  ""Considering this, let me discuss our expectations for the fiscal third quarter."",
  ""Starting with organic Wallboard growth, using our US business as the proxy as compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect single-family volumes to be roughly flat versus prior year, multi-family Wallboard volumes to be down roughly 25%, and commercial Wallboard volumes to be down high-single digits."",
  ""As a result, total organic Wallboard volumes are expected to be down mid to high-single digits and total Wallboard volumes, including acquisitions, are expected to be down low to mid-single digits."",
  ""Given the structural changes we've seen in the Wallboard space, including limited excess capacity and rising costs for manufacturers, particularly from the reduction in availability of synthetic gypsum, we expect like-for-like product level pricing to remain stable with where we are today until we see a more robust demand environment."",
  ""Therefore, for our fiscal third quarter, given our mix expectations, we anticipate Wallboard price and mix to be up slightly year-over-year."",
  ""In Ceilings, we expect third quarter volumes to be up high-single digits, driven by acquired volume and favorable project mix with mid-single digit improvement for price and mix."",
  ""For Steel Framing with soft conditions in commercial and multi-family activity expected to continue, volumes for our fiscal third quarter are expected to be down low-single digits, with price and mix down low to mid-single digits."",
  ""Although prices started to stabilize sequentially during our fiscal second quarter and despite recently announced increases, we expect the pricing in Steel Framing to contract slightly, as is seasonally typical during our fiscal third quarter."",
  ""Finally, net sales for our Complementary Products are expected to grow in the very low double digits year-over-year, likely around 10%, principally the result of acquired volume."",
  ""All in and as shown on slide 9, we expect our fiscal third quarter net sales to be up low-single digits as compared with a year ago, with organic sales down low to mid-single digits."",
  ""Gross margin is expected to continue to improve slightly over our fiscal second quarter at approximately 31.5% to 31.7% for our fiscal third quarter."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter is expected to be in the range of $113 million to $118 million with EBITDA margin of approximately 9% for what is seasonally our softest quarter."",
  ""As we continue to manage through this down cycle for the near term, we remain optimistic about the path ahead."",
  ""We see several positive trends on the horizon, including solid market demand for further housing construction, with a growing US population and undersupply of homes, along with rising demand for commercial construction in the United States, created by infrastructure investment, backed by government incentive programs, among other drivers, and with a further reduction in rates, We would expect additional drivers of demand to emerge."",
  ""We only need to look across the US northern border to see what could eventually happen here in the States, with further reductions in rates."",
  ""As we've seen a similar under build and pent-up demand situation in Canada, Canadians have been faster to react due to their typically shorter duration interest rate locks following a string of rate cuts by the Bank of Canada."",
  ""And with additional relief, expected homebuyers came off the sidelines in October, driving a 30% increase in homes sold as compared to the prior year and a 7.5% increase in the total monthly value of residential permits."",
  ""We would expect a similar directional boost in the US with mortgage rate relief."",
  ""In addition, further supporting optimism in Canada are programs such as the Government of Ontario's More Homes Built Faster Program and similar initiatives in other provinces."",
  ""These undertakings have been launched to ease the permitting and construction of additional and more affordable housing units, and we are encouraged by increasing enthusiasm for similar policy changes designed to address the need for additional housing in the United States."",
  ""In the meantime, the GMS business model is resilient and we firmly believe we are well-positioned to navigate this period as rates should continue to lower with time."",
  ""With the expectation that we will continue to generate substantial levels of cash flow, we expect to continue to invest in our business, further strengthen our balance sheet and execute against our strategic pillars to strengthen the company in anticipation of the next growth cycle."",
  "" for joining us today."",
  ""Operator, we are ready to open the line for questions."",
  ""I'm joined today by John Turner, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Scott Deakin, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""In addition to the press release we issued this morning, you can find a set of PowerPoint slides to accompany this call in the investors section of our website at www.gms.com."",
  ""On slide 2, on today's call, management's prepared remarks and answers to your questions may contain forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Forward-looking statements address matters that are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and may cause the actual results to differ from those discussed today."",
  ""As a reminder, forward-looking statements represent management's current estimates and expectations."",
  ""The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements in the future."",
  ""Listeners are encouraged to review the more detailed discussions related to these forward-looking statements contained in the company's filings with the SEC, including the Risk Factors section in the company's 10-K and other periodic reports."",
  ""Today's presentation also includes a discussion of certain non-GAAP measures."",
  ""The definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures are provided in the press release and presentation slides."",
  ""Please note that references on this call to the second quarter of fiscal 2025 relate to the quarter ended October 31, 2024."",
  ""Once we begin the question-and-answer session of the call, we kindly request that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up in the interest of time."",
  ""Starting with slide 5, I'll provide some further commentary on our second quarter results."",
  ""Net sales for the quarter increased 3.5% year-over-year to $1.47 billion."",
  ""Volume growth in Steel Framing, Ceilings and Complementary Products, primarily driven by $117 million in benefits from recent acquisitions, was partially offset by an estimated $20 million negative impact from the two major hurricanes that hit one of our largest and most robust regions, and an estimated $18 million negative impact from steel price deflation, assuming current year volumes have been sold at prior year prices."",
  ""As J.T. mentioned, organic sales declined 4.6% as compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to year-over-year market-driven declines in multi-family and commercial volumes, along with the impacts from hurricanes Helene and Milton."",
  ""From a US end market perspective, across all product lines, commercial sales dollars declined 4.4%, while multi-family fell off much more significantly, declining 16.9% as compared to a year ago."",
  ""US single-family sales dollars were up just slightly, less than 1% above the prior year quarter, but below our expectations as mortgage rates have increased despite the recent Fed rate reductions."",
  ""Also, given the heavier single-family weighting in the hurricanes hardest hit regions, the bulk of the hurricane impacts were evident in our single-family results."",
  ""Wallboard sales dollars of $582.1 million were down 0.5% as compared with the same period last year, comprised of a 1.6% decline in volume, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in price and mix."",
  ""Again, we estimate that the bulk of the $20 million reduction to net inorganic sales from this quarter's major hurricanes had the greatest impact on single-family volumes for Wallboard."",
  ""Organically, second quarter Wallboard sales were down 5.2%, entirely volume-driven, reflecting approximately flat year-over-year demand in single-family volumes, a 19.2% drop in multi-family volumes in commercial volumes that were down 6.9%."",
  ""The decline in Wallboard volume included an estimated nearly 200-basis-point reduction due to the hurricanes, with the remainder reflective of the weaker market conditions."",
  ""A heightened mix shift toward the lower-priced board used in the single-family construction resulted in flat year-over-year organic price and mix for Wallboard, despite a slight improvement in realized price."",
  ""Notwithstanding the unfavorable change in mix, the average unit value for Wallboard products was again up slightly sequentially from our fiscal first quarter as our team worked to implement the pricing actions that were announced by the manufacturers early this calendar year."",
  ""The average realized Wallboard price for the quarter was $481 per 1,000 square feet, which is similar to where we ended the quarter on October 31, but up slightly from the $476 second quarter average for fiscal 2024."",
  ""While the additional round of wallboard manufacturer price increases originally proposed to go into effect this fall were not realized in this current environment, given their escalating costs and industry capacity utilization that is estimated to be in the mid-80s even with relatively soft market conditions, we would expect a renewed attempt at increases sometime in the first half of calendar year 2025."",
  ""For Ceilings, including acquisitions, sales were up 16.6% year-over-year in the second quarter, comprised of an 11.1% improvement in volume and a 5.5% benefit from price and mix."",
  ""Organic sales for Ceilings grew 1.6% for the quarter, including a 2.5% decrease in volume, but with a 4.1% increase in price and mix."",
  ""The decrease in organic volumes this quarter can largely be attributed to the general slowdown in commercial activity, despite some bright spots in projects such as data centers and healthcare facilities."",
  ""Looking to calendar 2025, we expect that the inflationary dynamics typically associated with the ceilings market will continue."",
  ""Second quarter Steel Framing sales were down 6.3% in the quarter, reflecting volumes that improved 1.5%, offset by negative price and mix of 7.8%, which indicative of a stabilizing commodity market was better than we had expected."",
  ""As J.T. mentioned earlier, while steel prices were down year-over-year, we did start to see some slight sequential improvement as we move through the quarter."",
  ""And there are new supplier increase announcements in the market in this third quarter."",
  ""Organically, Steel Framing sales were down 14%, with an 8% decline in volume and a 6% decline in price and mix."",
  ""Complementary Products sales were $466.8 million for the quarter, grew 9% year-over-year, representing the 18th consecutive quarter of growth in this category."",
  ""Sales decreased 1.4% on an organic basis due primarily to the soft commercial and multi-family conditions combined with lower year-over-year pricing for some of our products, such as lumber and metal trim."",
  ""Our team remains focused on driving growth in Complementary Products, particularly for Tools & Fasteners, EIFS and Stucco and insulation, where these subcategories collectively grew 14.1% for the quarter."",
  ""Now turning to slide 6, which focuses on the quarter's profitability."",
  ""Gross profit of $461.1 million was just slightly higher than during the second quarter of fiscal year 2024."",
  ""Gross margin was 31.4%, down 90 basis points from a year ago."",
  ""Roughly two thirds of the percentage variance was a result of cost price dynamics from Wallboard manufacturer price increases not yet captured during the quarter, together with a mix shift from higher margin, commercial and multi-family business to single-family activity."",
  ""Unrealized manufacturer purchasing incentives given the tighter demand and storm disruption were also a factor by an estimated 15 basis points."",
  ""Finally, several onetime operational impacts, including inventory loss and damage and liquidation of capitalized freight, lower gross margin by another approximately 15 basis points."",
  ""Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter were $324.2 million, up from the prior year's $300.9 million."",
  ""As a $23.3 million year-over-year increase, approximately $21 million related to recent acquisitions."",
  ""$5.6 million related to additional severance costs, primarily associated with the previously disclosed cost containment actions, and $2 million related to higher insurance claims."",
  ""Despite the headwind of storm-related operating efficiency – inefficiencies in the quarter, these increases were partially offset by lower overall operating costs, reflective of the realized savings from the announced cost reduction actions and reduced activity in spending due to softer market conditions and mixed shift in end market demand."",
  ""SG&A expenses were 22% of net sales compared to the prior year's 21.2%, an increase of 80 basis points."",
  ""45 basis points were attributable to restructuring costs, primarily severance related to the previously announced cost containment efforts."",
  ""General operating cost inflation resulted in approximately 40 basis points of deleverage."",
  ""Operational expenses, principally associated with higher accident claim activity and rent expense drove 30 basis points of deleverage and steel price deflation contributed another approximately 30 basis points of deleverage."",
  ""These factors were partially offset by a 30 basis point improvement from a lower average operating costs of recent acquisitions, a 20 basis point improvement from our implemented structuring actions, and a 15 basis point improvement related to Wallboard price inflation."",
  ""Adjusted SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales of 21.1%, increased 50 basis points from 20.6%."",
  ""All in and inclusive of a 26.4% increase in interest expense, net income decreased 33.9% to $53.5 million or a $1.35 per diluted share compared to net income of $81 million or a $1.97 per diluted share."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA of a $152.2 million decreased 9.2% year-over-year from a $167.6 million in the prior year second quarter."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA margin was also down at 10.3% compared to the prior year quarter's 11.8%."",
  ""Now, continuing with the balance sheet on slide 7."",
  ""On October 31, we had cash on hand of $83.9 million and $458.6 million of available liquidity under our revolving credit facilities."",
  ""Following the acquisition of Kamco, Yvon and our affiliate earlier this calendar year, coupled with share repurchase activity and an increase in capitalized equipment leases, our net debt leverage was 2.3 times as of the end of the quarter, up from 1.5 times a year ago."",
  ""Cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $115.6 million, compared to $118.1 million in the prior year quarter."",
  ""Free cash flow was $101.5 million, which was almost 67% of our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter, compared to $102.1 million or 61% of adjusted EBITDA a year ago."",
  ""For the full year fiscal 2025, we now expect free cash flow to total approximately 60% to 65% of adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""Capital expenditures for the quarter were $14.1 million compared to $16 million a year ago."",
  ""At this point, we expect the capital expenditures will be approximately $45 million to $50 million for full year fiscal 2025."",
  ""During our fiscal second quarter, we repurchased 593,000 shares of stock for $52.3 million at an average price of $88.19 per share."",
  ""Indicative of continued confidence in the business, earlier this week, our Board of Directors renewed our share repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to $250 million of its shares outstanding."",
  ""Share buybacks continue to be a core component of our capital allocation strategy as we balance those repurchases with continued investment in our business, attractive M&A opportunities and debt repayment."",
  ""Our capital structure and solid balance sheet provide what we continue to believe an effective foundation for the execution of our strategic pillars."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call back to J.T. who will start on slide 8.""

  ""I guess first question is, around Wallboard price cost."",
  ""J.T., you mentioned, that – I think you guys have made some headway."",
  ""But you did mention that there is a competitive and price sensitive market."",
  ""Can you talk about where you are there as far as that price cost kind of getting that back and pushing that through kind of where you see that going over the next couple of quarters?"",
  ""Specifically on Wallboard, if you could."",
  ""And then kind of sticking to the, I guess, the pricing theme here, but maybe longer-term pricing expectations, especially around Steel Framing and I guess maybe even Ceilings, with the tile and grid, with the backdrop of some tariffs, the noise around tariffs, but also, with the new administration coming in and that sort of thing."",
  ""Any kind of color on that as far as maybe a little bit longer-term kind of pricing expectation there on other parts of your business?"",
  ""And best of luck with the rest of the quarter."",
  ""You gave us some views on multi-family and commercial."",
  ""You're pretty negative coming up."",
  ""I just want to clarify, is that sort of your view for the next quarter or is that something going into next year?"",
  ""And your commentary on the commercial Wallboard and Ceilings, the volume seems different."",
  ""It seems like Ceilings is going to do a lot better."",
  ""Is that remodel business or am I interpreting that wrong?"",
  ""The guidance for the next quarter, the net income, is that a GAAP net income or adjusted net income?"",
  ""Just in terms of the different outlook items, I'm curious where you feel like you have kind of the best visibility at this stage and whether, it's commercial project deferrals or maybe the same thing on the multi-family side, whether the level of visibility compared to three or six months ago as has improved at all?"",
  ""And then just second on SG&A. Could you talk a little bit about, how you're thinking about the next couple of quarters in terms of, getting back to neutral or maybe generating some positive SG&A leverage, just given some of the moving pieces with acquisitions and the cost reductions, obviously, volume is going to play a component as well."",
  ""But with where you sit today, how are you thinking about that over the next two to four quarters?"",
  ""You did mention you're expecting some renewed effort on price increases from the manufacturers early next year."",
  ""I understand your comment that getting price – let's say more price near term is challenging just given the level of demand."",
  ""But I mean, should we anticipate a similar kind of experience to what you dealt with this year with a bit of a lag to realize, but eventually getting at least some of the increase?"",
  ""Is that kind of the right way to think about it at this stage?"",
  ""And then, J.T., given your prepared comments about smaller builders and the challenges they're facing, can you just talk about how GMS is positioned relative to the larger builders versus the market."",
  ""Wanted to ask a broader question on Wallboard pricing."",
  ""You're kind of waiting on more demand to make it easier for that to get passed through."",
  ""Do you have a prediction on how much better activity needs to get to make that pricing more easily achieved?"",
  ""Just sort of thinking by all three end markets, how much better does it need to get to make it – to make it easier to swallow for the customers?"",
  ""And to clarify, when you talk about just any volume growth, is the market backdrop kind of moves from flattish to negative to more mixed?"",
  ""Or do you need just almost all three end markets or the composite backdrop to flip to volume growth?"",
  ""And last one for me, the good guys within the commercial market."",
  ""You cited healthcare, education, data centers, and you talked about how that's an uplift for Ceilings, at least offsetting other declines there."",
  ""But can you talk about the Complementary Products exposure to the good segments within the commercial market."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""Yeah, I want to go back to the Ceilings side."",
  ""If I look at your guidance and take into account that the Kamco acquisition and some of the other deals are driving kind of double-digit M&A contribution and you're expecting a mid-single-digit price/mix growth."",
  ""That suggests that organic volumes would be declining, call it, like, high-single digits, which is a pretty big acceleration to the downside versus the last couple of quarters."",
  ""Can you talk more specifically about what's driving that expectation for your organic Ceilings volumes in 3Q. Okay."",
  ""If we can follow up on some of the M&A contributions by segment I guess... ...offline."",
  ""And then shifting gears to margins, I just want to make sure we understand kind of some of the bridge correctly."",
  ""The 60 basis points, that basket is price/cost/mix."",
  ""It sounded like it's mostly price/cost, but can you expand on that part a little bit more."",
  ""And then similarly, I want to make sure that we understand the unrealized rebate issue, which – and volumes are down year-on-year."",
  ""It makes sense that your rebates will be down."",
  ""But is there something that was more temporary about that, that resolves over the next couple of quarters?"",
  ""Yeah, that was going to be my last clarification."",
  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""Just on Wallboard price and mix."",
  ""Did you call out the kind of like-for-like versus mix or I guess quantify that impact?"",
  ""And I guess as you're looking at Q3 and presumably beyond, as you got this headwind from multi-family and commercial, I'm just curious if there's a way to parse out how you're thinking about that mix headwind going forward in Wallboard."",
  ""And you're effectively assuming they will continue that way going forward?"",
  ""And then just on the M&A landscape."",
  ""Obviously, you've been quite active in the past year."",
  ""So my question is, from you guys, should we be looking for kind of a digestion period here going forward?"",
  ""Or perhaps, given the kind of choppier end market backdrop, does it seem like the M&A funnel is reasonably active from a valuation perspective?"",
  ""Just kind of where are you guys willing to operate from a leverage perspective?"",
  ""Any thoughts on M&A into the next year?"",
  "", J.T. Good luck, guys."",
  ""Hey,  for taking my questions today."",
  ""Did you guys see a deceleration in single-family demand as we move through the quarter and into November as the, industry and there's an air pocket from slower single-family starts earlier this year?"",
  ""And if so, are you expecting the air pocket and demand to last multiple quarters on the single-family side?"",
  ""As we look at third quarter, obviously, and into the fourth quarter, how you're thinking about things right now?"",
  ""And then I just wanted to touch on Steel Framing pricing."",
  ""Obviously, you saw some sequential improvement and, even though you're expecting seasonal dip here, with manufactured prices increases in the market, are you seeing signs, pricing is starting to stabilize?"",
  ""And if we see any improvement in market demand, things could improve into 2025?"",
  ""I think we just discussed maybe 60 basis points of gross margin was still price/costs attributed to Wallboard."",
  ""And that's slightly better than it was in our last quarter."",
  ""And we talked about the gross margin moving forward sequentially, again, somewhere between 10 basis points and 30 basis points."",
  ""Most of that is going to come from the normalization of some of the onetime events that we saw in the quarter that Scott talked about."",
  ""But we continue to see, as I just indicated, a little bit of improvement in Wallboard price going forward."",
  ""But it's a really difficult market right now."",
  ""I think we've gotten about as much as we can get, particularly in some of the residential markets."",
  ""With multi-family being down as much as 25% in the market, probably unlikely to get much price in multi-family."",
  ""And you can hear the single-family guys and their remarks, difficult to get much more in single-family, although we continue to find ways to get a little bit here and there."",
  ""We are focused in other parts of the business to improve gross margin as well, not just Wallboard."",
  ""I think, commercially, we still have an opportunity with our service advantage and some of the ability to service some of the more difficult work that's out there, to continue to drive some more gross margin until we really see a demand-improved environment."",
  ""I think the key driver here is demand."",
  ""When we see demand improve, instead of continue to decline in volume, I think that's when we'll all be able to go out and get all of our margin."",
  ""I mean, there's tariffs in place now on steel, right?"",
  ""And so it should be somewhat helpful for us if those stay in place and/or increase, no big impact in ceiling tiles from tariffs."",
  ""We expect that market to be basically what it has been forever, which is slightly inflationary almost all the time, in that case."",
  ""Tariffs in general, really for us, we talk about it internally that we'll have to wait and see what happens."",
  ""But steel is really the one product that we would have that would be impacted dramatically from tariffs."",
  ""Tools & Fasteners in some respects also, but mostly steel would be impacted, which I guess I would consider it probably a positive for us as a distributor."",
  ""But I think that's probably more positive than negative for us."",
  ""In the near term, with no tariffs, we still see steel bouncing along the bottom, right?"",
  ""We had a little bit better quarter from a price perspective this last quarter."",
  ""The underlying commodity, the cold-rolled steel is kind of bouncing around right about the bottom of where it's been over the course of the last 18 months."",
  ""And hopefully that's what it does in the near term with demand being off is that it kind of flattened."",
  ""So kind of what we have in our forecast going forward is flattening price."",
  ""And again, just as a reminder, what you already know, the steel industry is all about cars and all about appliances and all about structural steel."",
  ""So, I think, in general, with an improving rate environment, that's probably going to help also be inflationary for steel."",
  ""Well, again, the categories that we're most involved in, Keith, in construction, to this point, aren't showing a whole heck of a lot of improvement as we go into the next few quarters."",
  ""I would expect with rates coming down that what we'll see is we'll see a pretty good improvement across the board."",
  ""I mean, retail has been lousy."",
  ""Healthcare and education has been buying and holding in."",
  ""Data centers are good, but that's offsetting just the office component."",
  ""All the manufacturing spending that we're seeing, all the infrastructure spending that we're seeing in construction, that's not helping in the wallboard business."",
  ""So we need people to build structures."",
  ""And so, we don't see a lot of impetus for new structures being built over the course of the last couple of quarters."",
  ""All that being said, just like I said last quarter, if this is the bottom of the cycle, which we feel like we're moving into the bottom of the cycle as we speak, it's a relatively soft cycle."",
  ""Well, a couple of things."",
  ""Ceilings are doing better than the underlying Wallboard business because of the projects that are happening."",
  ""So data centers are great for Ceilings."",
  ""Healthcare has been good for Ceilings, education has been very good for Ceilings."",
  ""And that's offset basically the fact that office has been lousy, right?"",
  ""So those categories are fine for Ceilings."",
  ""Additionally, the acquisition of Kamco, what you're seeing there, if you look at our organic versus our acquired volumes, Kamco is an exceptionally strong Ceilings provider in New York City."",
  ""And so we have been seeing a little bit of recovery in New York City when it comes to some office activity, et cetera, and Kamco is doing a fantastic job up in the city."",
  ""So we are benefiting from that."",
  ""I mean, I think our best end market visibility is single-family and then commercial."",
  ""And what's been happening in multi-family, which is unusual, is the degree of delay of the projects."",
  ""So we still have the pipeline, but the pipeline is not being sold because the projects aren't happening."",
  ""So as we get on the line with our guys and they talk about the pipeline, what we hear consistently is that three or four or five of the largest projects and each one of the divisions continues to be pushed down the road, not canceled, but being told by subcontractors and developers that the projects are being delayed in anticipation of lower rates or the need for lower rates and/or the financing itself didn't come through."",
  ""So that's basically what we're seeing."",
  ""And so the multi-family pipeline, we can see it."",
  ""Unfortunately, it just keeps getting delayed and pushed down the road."",
  ""But most of the commercial work that we're doing, our projects related to kind of the mega projects and CHIPS Acts and Infrastructure Acts, et cetera."",
  ""So we see those and/or healthcare education, those are all still happening."",
  ""And of course the data centers."",
  ""So I think the best visibility is single-family then I would tell you that we're pretty confident in the outlook on commercial and then multi-family remains difficult because of the degree in which we just don't see them happening."",
  ""I mean, I think we're pretty close to neutral in this next quarter and then I would expect us to be better going forward."",
  ""Again, I'm going to caveat that the same way you did in that if we don't see further declines in volume, that make it much more that we end up chasing."",
  ""Right, as you know as you're chasing the volume declines, you're always trying to understand the degree of fixed infrastructure that might be necessary to be taken out versus the variable piece."",
  ""The variable piece, obviously, we will take out some of it naturally and some of it has to be forced out."",
  ""But that I'm very confident in, the fixed piece we'll have to take a step back and understand there's more of that that's necessary or not."",
  ""Right now we're getting north of $30 million from our cost savings activity last quarter."",
  ""And I think we've done a nice job to get us positioned to get us through the next two quarters and three quarters, which I really would imagine would have to be the bottom based upon what we're hearing from a rates perspective."",
  ""Barring any kind of really strange new policies coming in from the government."",
  ""But I would guess we're two quarters to three quarters away from a bottom."",
  ""I think we'll absolutely – as an industry, I think it's become very, very aware."",
  ""Manufacturers are very aware of their customers, meaning distributors difficulty in passing through this last price increase."",
  ""So I think there'll be a combination of everyone working together to get the next one in."",
  ""All that being said, we always have a lag to get it, but we're basically communicating now moving forward to our customers that, prices are going to probably be up in the first half at some point."",
  ""We're going to have to decide when that is."",
  ""But we're beginning to communicate that now and work through some of those issues, the same ones we've had to work through."",
  ""But I would expect a similar experience to what we've had this year, albeit I do think that we will get more of any kind of price increase from the market going forward simply because we all need to at this point, we all must get more."",
  ""And so I'm hoping and believing that we'll do this more in partnership across the manufacturing environment and in the last price increase."",
  ""I mean, again, I think that we are in a wonderful position along with a couple of the largest competitors out there to service the national builders in a much better way than, let's say, a lot of the smaller competitors can."",
  ""And that's just our ability to flex our equipment, our ability to move equipment around."",
  ""So in the morning, it's very easy for us to do a commercial drop and then get out in the afternoon and do residential drops with the same equipment."",
  ""All of our equipment is capable of both."",
  ""For the most part, all of our teams are trained to be able to do both."",
  ""We've got the geographic presence across every major market in the country, with the exception of one or two very small – very small places like Utah to serve anybody's volume."",
  ""So I think that when it comes to being able to service the national builder, we're in a great spot along with, again, just or two competitors."",
  ""But we also do service the small builder and we love the small builder business."",
  ""We have wonderful relationships there, small and medium builder business there."",
  ""And we're really hopeful for them to have success as well."",
  ""And that hopefully the rising tide floats all boats when it comes to the situation next year with rates."",
  ""I really feel like it just needs growth."",
  ""It just needs volume growth."",
  ""It doesn't need dramatic volume growth."",
  ""Low-single digit volume growth would be enough."",
  ""And I mean, ultimately, customers again are exceptionally difficult in environments where they are under the same profit pressures that we are under."",
  ""And so it's not a time when anybody is comfortable accepting a price increase in anything when it comes to building products."",
  ""I mean, if you really look across the spectrum of building products, probably insulation is the one that's probably the firmest."",
  ""And again, that's a really tight capacity situation."",
  ""So for me, it's going to take just a little bit of volume to go out and get it."",
  ""And let me just clarify one word you use there waiting."",
  ""We're not waiting for anything."",
  ""We're fighting every single day to get pricing and we continue to get it, albeit trickling in versus pouring in."",
  ""Well, I think it's going to be depending on the degree of growth in each one of those categories."",
  ""I mean, if we see a significant mid-single digit to high-digit uplift in single-family activity or the expectation of that, if we see mortgage rates get into that 6% range, we've seen some pretty damn good activity with selling and mortgage."",
  ""Even just this last week with just this little drop in rates, we saw, right, a big pop in mortgage applications just in this last week."",
  ""If we can see some activity in single-family in the neighborhood of that mid-single digit to high-single digit, that would do it almost regardless of what's going on with multi-family and commercial."",
  ""I think multi-family will come back summertime."",
  ""You'll start to see things be better come summertime."",
  ""I think a lot of the multi-family developers are trying their best to accelerate seeing the demand that's out there."",
  ""They just have to get the projects out of the ground."",
  ""It's really hard for them to do that right now, but I do think that'll be better come summertime and commercial is going to be what it is until we get some more residential development and reduction in rates."",
  ""This kind of mid-single digit, low-single digit declines."",
  ""But, any growth at all in the composite aggregate Wallboard consumption I think will be enough."",
  ""I mean, we're equally weighted."",
  ""That's I think, all things being equal, we'd be a little stronger in Complementary Products than we would be in Wallboard volume commercially because of the data centers and the degree of the strength in data centers."",
  ""When it comes to Complementary, I think we're a little heavily a little more heavily weighted in data centers with Complementary Products than some of the core commercial categories."",
  ""I mean, we have more like low-single digits down."",
  ""So I'm not sure how the math is working out right here on the call, but I think our organic Ceilings volumes are probably low-single digits, similar to what we just experienced."",
  ""I mean, I think what we said was like-for-like pricing is very similar to up again, sequentially."",
  ""And this next quarter, we're talking about again overall pricing being up, flat or up slightly in spite of that mix impact."",
  ""But we're still getting a little bit of pricing on a like-for-like basis."",
  ""I mean, through the third quarter at least, we are."",
  ""I mean, the pipeline is still really good."",
  ""We expect to stay active."",
  ""We have allocated a little bit more cash towards share repurchase."",
  ""I think it was prudent as we purchased a lot of shares at $88 on average this last quarter."",
  ""And we obviously have the authorization now renewed."",
  ""All that being said, we still like 1.5 times to 2.5 times leverage."",
  ""So that's certainly something we're targeting."",
  ""We do expect to continue to generate really good cash flow as we mentioned, 60% to 65% of adjusted EBITDA now."",
  ""That's a higher amount than we had historically guided to."",
  ""That's a combination of us managing working capital better, but also just managing working capital in a declining environment."",
  ""So we still have plenty of cash to do things with."",
  ""And again, I would expect – we'll wait and see what happens over the course of the next few months as the new administration steps in, if there's any shocks to the system."",
  ""But it does look like 2025 late to 2026, maybe even faster, could be really good."",
  ""So I don't think we'd be afraid to get up into that 2.5 times range considering the cash we're going to generate and the expectation that 2026 and 2027, probably late 2025, we hope, are looking pretty good."",
  ""I don't think we'll slow down the M&A a lot."",
  ""Well, I mean, we're thinking it's flat as we go through this quarter, which is certainly lower than we would have thought two or three quarters ago."",
  ""But we're not seeing a dramatic deceleration as we go forward."",
  ""I mean, October starts were lousy, but those aren't going to impact us this quarter."",
  ""We'll have to see how November starts came in."",
  ""And so there's – it's really choppy, as I said."",
  ""If you look at it, one week is bad and the next week it looks like it might be better."",
  ""And then long-term rates were below 4.2 yesterday, the 10 year."",
  ""Now, I don't know what it is this morning, who knows?"",
  ""But I think that if we get mortgage rates mid-6s, I think single-family is going to, just kind of muddle along."",
  ""If mortgage rates are 7-plus, I think we could find ourselves in a more difficult spot when it comes to single-family."",
  ""I think what we'll see in 2025, at least in the first half of 2025, because of the – in our space, at least is flat pricing in spite of the price increases."",
  ""I think there'll be spots where prices can go up."",
  ""I think there's a lot of markets where it'll just remain flat as we go forward."",
  ""I do think steel pricing is going to be another beneficiary of lower rates because I do believe the automobile industry will do better."",
  ""I probably believe that we're not going to see a reduction in the tariff environment when it comes to steel."",
  ""And we'll probably see an increase in that environment, right."",
  ""Or at least in rhetoric when it comes to steel."",
  ""So I think with improving automobile sales, with improving housing, which would improve appliances, with improved commercial construction, that would improve structural steel, I think that you should see things maybe accelerate in the back half of 2025."",
  ""But steel has been as volatile as anything and the hardest one to predict."",
  ""So, I don't know if you can take my prediction to the bank."",
  ""I would just tell you over the next quarter or two, we think at least flat is reasonable."",
  ""And I would just add for clarity's sake, we don't source any of our steel framing externally or outside of the country, but to the extent there is an overall impact to the rolled steel market, that would impact us indirectly."",
  ""So we provide if you look in the slide deck to the back slide, we actually provide a reconciliation of that."",
  ""So you can see those particulars there."",
  ""I mean, capacity levels are already tight and the inflationary dynamics are driving the manufacturers to be inflationary."",
  ""So we've really essentially got the fundamentals on the supply side."",
  ""We really just need more demand side support in terms of being able to get the market to understand that."",
  ""All that said, the reality is that single-family – the leverage effect of demand on single-family is higher on a per unit basis, which I think is understood."",
  ""The price/cost dynamics is roughly two-thirds of that is one element of it."",
  ""The second piece is, just with the way the manufacturer incentive programs, the work is around a calendar year basis."",
  ""And with the decline in the markets and with the storm impact, ultimately, our ability to generate enough purchase volume against that was impacted in this last quarter at a rate that was higher than what we had typically seen in the third quarter."",
  ""So that drives the year-over-year difference for us."",
  ""And just fundamentally, given the timing of it, we don't think we can make it up accordingly, affecting our ability to recruit against it."",
  ""I'd say also in that, in terms of our ability to manage the leverage, even though we just renewed our share repurchase authorization, we really got the ability to flex that up and down to be both opportunistic in terms of what we're doing in share repurchase but also manage cash to direct it appropriately towards acquisition should we need to.""
