Your approach is innovative and leverages integer mapping to potentially improve the join performance. Let's break down the steps, analyze the feasibility, and estimate the time savings:

### 1\. *Concept of Integer Mapping for Faster Joins*:

*   *Rationale*: Joining on integer columns can be faster than joining on alphanumeric columns because integers require less storage space and allow for more efficient indexing.
*   *Hash to Integer Mapping*: By converting the JOB_HASH alphanumeric key to an integer, you aim to reduce the computational overhead involved in join operations.

### 2\. *Steps in Your Approach*:

*   *Extract Unique JOB_HASH Values*: Collecting unique JOB_HASH values from all four tables will create a manageable set that you can map.
*   *Mapping to Integers*: Assigning a unique integer to each JOB_HASH value creates a direct one-to-one mapping, which you can use as a surrogate key.
*   *Adding Integer Column*: Storing the integer representation alongside the JOB_HASH allows you to join using the new integer column.
*   *Reversing the Mapping*: After the join operation, reverting to JOB_HASH by reversing the mapping ensures consistency with the original data format.

### 3\. *Benefits*:

*   *Faster Joins*: Integer joins are typically faster due to reduced computational complexity and better use of indexing. The database engine can perform integer comparisons faster than string comparisons.
*   *Reduced Memory Usage*: Storing integers consumes less memory compared to alphanumeric strings, improving cache efficiency.
*   *Improved Index Performance*: Indexes on integer columns are more compact and require fewer I/O operations.

### 4\. *Potential Time Savings*:

*   The actual time savings depend on several factors:
    *   *Database Engine*: Some modern database engines are optimized for handling alphanumeric joins efficiently. If you're using one of these, the performance gain might be less pronounced.
    *   *Indexing and Query Optimization*: Well-designed indexes on JOB_HASH could already be optimized for performance, reducing the benefit of using integer mapping.
    *   *Hardware and Configuration*: The performance gain will be more evident on systems with limited memory and processing power.
*   *Estimated Time Savings*: If you're currently experiencing significant delays due to alphanumeric joins, you could expect noticeable improvements. In practice, integer joins could be 2-5 times faster than string joins, depending on indexing and database configuration.

### 5\. *Considerations*:

*   *Implementation Complexity*: This approach adds complexity to your ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process. You need to maintain the mapping logic and ensure consistency across all operations.
*   *Maintenance Overhead*: Any changes to JOB_HASH values would require updates to the mapping table.
*   *Reverse Mapping Step*: Adding a reverse mapping step after joining might reintroduce some of the time savings lost in the join operation.

### 6\. *Alternative Approaches*:

*   *Direct Index Optimization*: If not already in place, create a composite index on JOB_HASH columns in all four tables. This may significantly improve join performance without the complexity of integer mapping.
*   *Partitioning*: Consider partitioning your tables based on JOB_HASH if applicable. This can sometimes optimize join operations.
*   *Materialized Views*: If the data is relatively static, creating materialized views for frequently joined combinations could speed up retrieval times.

### Conclusion:

Your approach could lead to significant time savings, especially if you currently observe slow join operations on JOB_HASH columns. However, it's essential to weigh the complexity and maintenance overhead against the expected performance benefits. Testing with a subset of data and benchmarking the join performance before and after implementing the integer mapping would provide a clearer picture of the time savings you can expect.
