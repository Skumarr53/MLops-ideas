  ""We appreciate you joining us today."",
  ""For those of you that may be learning about VENU for the first time, let me take a few minutes and tell you our story and what we've accomplished over the past few years."",
  ""VENU is a leading developer of luxury entertainment venues dedicated to transforming how fans experience live music and hospitality."",
  ""From state of the art amphitheaters and intimate music halls, our spaces are thoughtfully designed to put fan experience front and center with unparalleled entertainment and exceptional service."",
  ""We are known for our disruptive approach to live entertainment."",
  ""We have created unique, elevated amenities, like luxury fire-pits suites and premium custom-built Owners Clubs."",
  ""Our luxury outdoor amphitheaters range from 8,000 to 20,000 seats, and our entertainment campuses feature legendary restaurants, premium size, mid-size event centers and live music halls."",
  ""Our goal is to create unforgettable experience for all of our fans."",
  ""In our third quarter, VENU brought luxury entertainment to life."",
  ""We successfully executed our business plan and most notably opened our gates to 8,000 capacity, $70 million development known as the Ford Amphitheater here in Colorado Springs."",
  ""The amphitheater adopted the name Ford Amphitheater after Colorado Ford Dealers purchased the primary naming rights for 10 years for $13 million, which was one of the largest amphitheater sponsorships in history."",
  ""The amphitheater is booked and operated in partnership with AEG Presents-Rocky Mountains."",
  ""We started hosting acts about a third of the way through our typical season starting in August with a sold-out three day grand opening weekend by Grammy Award winner Ryan Tedder and his globally recognized band, OneRepublic."",
  ""We ended the season in September, having hosted 17 incredible shows, featuring internationally renowned performers like Steve Miller Band, Robert Plant, Alison Krauss and Walker Hayes."",
  ""We ended the season welcoming over 96,000 fans from over 5,500 zip codes from all 50 states and was recently nominated for Pollstar Magazine's 2024 New Concert Venue of the Year, which recognizes venues that have made significant impacts in the live entertainment industry through exceptional design, operation and audience experience."",
  ""We believe 2025 is going to roar, and we are actively booking an exciting line-up with six shows already announced for the upcoming season."",
  ""We are also set to unveil our highly anticipated $35 million dining and entertainment collection here in Colorado Springs in the spring of 2025."",
  ""We're strategically developing the building to sit alongside the very eastern perimeter of the Ford Amphitheater."",
  ""We designed this to be able to be used year-round and with many different experience options, restaurants, bars, Owners Clubs and a vibrant social and private event space all with floor-to-ceiling windows to showcase the unparalleled views of the Rocky Mountains."",
  ""Outside of the Ford Amphitheater, we have 11 markets operating and/or in various stages of development."",
  ""Colorado Springs, Colorado, and Gainesville, Georgia are operating."",
  ""And we are in the construction phase in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, the Tulsa Market, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, El Paso, Texas and our largest in our collection so far announced in McKinney, Texas, the Dallas-Fort Worth market."",
  ""Further, there are five additional markets in the preconstruction stage, setting the stage for continued growth."",
  ""We believe that these initial markets are projected to add over $2 billion in real estate assets to our balance sheet and will bring our seating capacity and inventory to an anticipated 150,000 seats."",
  ""When they are fully developed, the complexes in the collection will host up to 60 shows a year, which calculates gross saleable seating at approximately 10 million tickets per year."",
  ""With an expected average gross sale price of $150, VENU's annual gross receipts could be in excess of $1.5 billion per year."",
  ""In the past few months, we also made notable announcements."",
  ""In the spring and early summer, we proudly announced two new public-private partnerships, one in McKinney, Texas and the other in El Paso, Texas."",
  ""These collaborations join our existing partnerships in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma, making three significant private partnerships for VENU."",
  ""These strategic alliances play a vital role in our site selection and expansion efforts, and we are honored to work alongside these great communities."",
  ""This October, we announced Kaiser Permanente's exclusive partnership at Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs, and we held an official ground-breaking ceremony in Broken Arrow, Oklahoma."",
  ""Of course, in August VENU opened the Ford Amphitheater in Colorado Springs."",
  ""In November, we rebranded our mid-sized music hall here in Colorado Springs after a new naming rights sponsorship was announced with Phil Long Ford Dealerships, one of Colorado's largest auto dealerships."",
  ""Also in November, as mentioned previously, our Ford Amphitheater was nominated for Pollstar's 2024 New Concert Venue of the Year."",
  ""In December, we announced our strategic partnership with Dallas Cowboy, 3 times Super Bowl champion and Founder of EIGHT Elite Light Lager, Troy Aikman."",
  ""Our partnership with Troy Aikman makes EIGHT beer the powerhouse partner for all of our Texas and Oklahoma venues along with making Troy the namesake of our membership based Owners Clubs in both Texas and Oklahoma."",
  ""We are branding these exclusive suites, the Aikman Club."",
  ""Finally, I am honored to have accepted a seat on EIGHT's Advisory Board of Directors."",
  ""In addition to these exciting developments, we are very fortunate that just a few weeks ago, in December, we announced two additional employees."",
  ""The first, our new President, Will Hodgson, who we will hear from shortly, and our powerhouse Chief Marketing Officer, Terri Liebler."",
  ""And finally, in December, we believe in giving back to the communities that support us."",
  ""So, we announced our official non-profit organization, VENU Arts and Culture Foundation, dedicated to nurturing talent, creating shared experiences that will unite communities together and championing our initiatives."",
  ""Now with that, I will turn it over to Will Hodgson, our President."",
  ""And again,  for everybody being here."",
  ""At VENU, we are built for music fans."",
  ""We're built by music fans, and we're redefining the live music experience from every angle and we're proud to be doing all that we are doing."",
  ""With that, I'm going to open it up to Q&A., Sara, and , all, for joining VENU's September 30, 2024 third quarter  and update."",
  ""On the call today, we have our Founder, Chairman and CEO, JW Roth as well as our President, Will Hodgson."",
  ""Following the Safe Harbor statement, JW will provide an overview of our business, then Will is going to provide an update on the current expansion plans for VENU."",
  ""And finally, I'll provide a summary of the quarterly financial results."",
  ""Following that, we'll open up the call for questions."",
  ""We'd like to remind everyone that various remarks about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""VENU cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated, including risks described in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 and other filings with SEC, all of which can be viewed on the company's website at venu.live spelled V-E-N-U-dot-L-I-V-E or on SEC's website at sec.gov."",
  ""Any forward-looking statements made on this conference call speak only as at today's date, Monday, December 23, 2024, and VENU does not intend to update any of these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that would occur after today's date except as may be required by federal securities laws."",
  ""With that, I'd like to turn over the call to our Founder, Chairman and CEO, JW Roth."",
  ""And it's certainly a pleasure to talk to everybody today on the call."",
  ""I've lived and breathed this industry for 25 years and just coming off of close to a decade of running the House of Blues Entertainment brand and just really excited to dig in and help develop and execute VENU's disruptive vision."",
  ""I mean, we have a robust roadmap for VENU's growth as we move into 2025."",
  ""Not only are there significant opportunities to improve profitability from our existing revenue streams through more strategic F&B tactics, streamlined premium upgrades, innovative marketing and better cost control through system integration and data analytics, we also plan to add several outlets JW just spoke of, but none bigger than the Broken Arrow Amphitheater coming in the fall of 2025."",
  ""As always, we will continue to evaluate the guest and artist experiences at our venues, always striving to improve our already best-in-class reputation."",
  ""With that, I'd like to turn it back over to our Chief Financial Officer, Heather Atkinson."",
  ""I appreciate everyone being on the call."",
  ""I'm going to dive right into some of our performance highlights from the Q and on our press release."",
  ""As you might have seen already, our total assets rose to $166.6 million as of September 30th, 2024, an increase of 100% compared to the same period from $83.2 million at December 31, 2023."",
  ""Property and equipment totaled $125.8 million as of September 30, 2024, an increase of 118% compared to $57.7 million as of December 31, 2023."",
  ""Over the limited 2024 season of 17 shows at the Ford Amphitheater for the three months ended September 30, 2024, this location generated gross receipts of $12.7 million, which is inclusive of ticket sales, concessions, ticketing fees, parking, premium upgrades as well as other receipts."",
  ""The Ford Amphitheater sold over 83,000 tickets at an average of $152 per ticket in its first 17 shows."",
  ""Total revenues for the company were $13.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, an increase of 56% compared to $8.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023."",
  ""For the three months ended September 2024, total revenues were $5.5 million or an increase of 39% as compared to $3.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2023."",
  ""Our restaurant operations business generated $2.7 million or 50% of our total revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2024 and $8.1 million or 60% for the nine months ended September 30, 2024."",
  ""Our event operations defined as our small to midsize live entertainment venues generated $3.7 million or 28% of our total revenue during the nine months ended September 30, 2024 or $1.1 million or 21% of our total revenue during the three months ended September 30, 2024."",
  ""Our amphitheater operations generated net profit, which is defined as profits after our split with our operating partner, AEG, which included receipts from our naming rights agreements, which are outside of our AEG Partnership Agreement of $1.6 million or 30% of our total revenue for the three months ending September 30, 2024 or 12% of our total revenue."",
  ""And we did not recognize any amphitheater operation net profits prior to the opening of Ford Amphitheater in August 2024."",
  ""With that said, I'd like to now turn the call back over to JW.""

  ""JW and team, great quarter."",
  ""Way to come out of the gates hot, congratulations."",
  ""I was just wondering for the new markets that are happening in Oklahoma and Texas, will AEG continue to be your partner there and will they go along to each venue along with you or will you secure a new partner in each one of those locations?"",
  ""This is a great kick-off."",
  ""Just going ahead, and please excuse me if I missed your opening comments, but the $2 billion of facilities, what proportion of that is signed and what proportion are there preliminary letters of intent and are just in the pipeline that you're working on?"",
  ""It would be very useful if you sliced and diced that by category not by city."",
  ""Like, how many are signed versus how many are under construction and how many are letters of intent, just let's say for the future if not today."",
  ""What proportion of that have signed agreements with the city and finished development, obviously, under construction counts."",
  ""Once you have the site, that's a huge step."",
  ""And how long are your agreements with AEG and Live Nation?"",
  ""And how much of the Ford agreement was included into your quarter?"",
  ""Let me be more clear."",
  ""You show in the quarter an operating profit, which is great."",
  ""I wonder how much of those revenues each year or in this period is the Ford payment, the Ford signed payment?"",
  ""I'm not being clear enough."",
  ""Just the sale of naming rights."",
  ""How much in revenue did you show in the quarter and how much are you going to show per year going ahead?"",
  ""And looking forward to your future calls."",
  ""So, first,  for joining."",
  ""Let me sort of start with how we have viewed the amphitheater here at – in Colorado Springs, the Ford Amphitheater, and what it has sort of taught us as we've gone along."",
  ""Number one is we have honed in on our public-private partnerships."",
  ""The whole key to our business and the foundation of our business is developing these public-private partnerships."",
  ""Bob Mudd has done an excellent job."",
  ""Ryan and company has done an excellent job in developing these relationships, expanding these relationships and prospecting new relationships in new communities."",
  ""We have a very strong list of communities that we are working with."",
  ""And over the course of the next several years, we will continue to build these amphitheaters under these public-private partnerships."",
  ""As sort of the idea of learnings go and it's interesting, you learn sort of three different things."",
  ""The first is the value of premium seating."",
  ""We never knew going into the Ford what sort of – or we didn't know what to anticipate."",
  ""There's big construction going on right next to us and it keeps knocking my phone out of here."",
  ""Crystal, would you do me a favor and call the construction company and have them stop this a second?"",
  ""Again, I apologize for the construction noise."",
  ""What I meant by premium seating is we did not realize going into the Ford how premium seating was going to be... It's JW Roth again."",
  ""We have construction going on in our offices and they knocked our phone lines out here for a second."",
  ""So, anyway, I will continue, and this time, hopefully we can get through this."",
  ""As it relates to premium seating, our premium seating has been more than we could have ever imagined."",
  ""We went into our season, in the 2024 season, thinking that our premium seating would represent about 50% and that we would earn about 20% on that premium seating."",
  ""It turned out that premium seating was 100% and that our turnover in premium seating was about 50%."",
  ""So, to answer the question I would say that – I'm going to have to go back and relearn the question."",
  ""But to answer the question, I would say that's where we're at with our learnings."",
  ""Marty,  for the question and  for joining us today."",
  ""Here in Colorado, AEG has been our operating partner and they've done a terrific job."",
  ""I don't think we could be more happy than we are with that partnership."",
  ""As we move forward into new markets, every market has strengths and weaknesses as it relates to operating partners."",
  ""Operating partners being AEG and/or Live Nation or whoever it might be in that particular market."",
  ""We have made the decision, at least for right now, to operate Tulsa and McKinney and possibly El Paso as an open room."",
  ""So, we'll see what that – we'll see how that shakes out."",
  ""But what that means is that it will be open to Live Nation to book into those amphitheaters as well as AEG."",
  ""Actual operations will either come through an operating partner agreement or it will come through an ASM-style agreement."",
  ""Steve,  for the question."",
  ""And, first, Steve,  for taking the time to be on the call."",
  ""You're a very, very good investor and I appreciate you, appreciate your question."",
  ""So, we are in the process – actually in development process at several different stages with several different municipalities."",
  ""So, as I said earlier, we are in – we're either opened or opening 11 new venues and we're somewhere in that process with all 11 venues."",
  ""At the end of the day, we really don't know the exact number per development until the fire-pits suites are circled and we have a good idea of what the end result will be."",
  ""So, as each municipality comes on, they could be worth between $150 million and, in the case of McKinney, well over $300 million."",
  ""So, I've got to be a little careful to talk about the specific municipalities because we have confidentiality agreements with them, but I can tell you that we have a good line of sight to over $2 billion in net tangible assets in the municipalities that we currently have prospected."",
  ""So, where we're at in each one of those, I got to be careful talking about, but I could tell you that we have good line of sight to that number."",
  ""So, as we've reported, Colorado Springs is open and operating."",
  ""Gainesville is open and operating."",
  ""Broken Arrow is under construction."",
  ""We are under construction and under development in McKinney."",
  ""We'll be closing on that land here in about two weeks, but the development agreement is signed and dirt is moving."",
  ""In El Paso, we are not under construction yet, but we are signed there."",
  ""We have LOIs going back and forth in three additional markets."",
  ""And then, we have development agreements in process and/or prospecting in process in an additional three markets, if that answers your question."",
  ""Yes, no question about that."",
  ""So, El Paso signed, McKinney signed, Broken Arrow signed, Colorado Springs completed, Gainesville signed and completed, Oklahoma City is in process right now, not signed but in process."",
  ""And then we have – there are a total of three and then three more, so six altogether that are not signed but they are in process."",
  ""That's about all I can say about that."",
  ""So, typically, Steve, these operating agreements are 10 with two 5s."",
  ""We will be operating Broken Arrow most likely as an open room as we will be in McKinney and in El Paso."",
  ""With that said, we will most likely have agreements very similar to what we have in Colorado Springs with AEG but limited."",
  ""So, in other words, we might have a – I'll give you an example, in McKinney, we'll most likely have two or three agreements with two or three operators that would all be participating in booking and promotion into that room."",
  ""And the reason that is, is because a market like McKinney is just tough for one promoter to do it all, especially in an amphitheater that size."",
  ""So, most likely, there'll be multiple partners in that particular amphitheater."",
  ""But to answer your question, a typical arrangement is 10 with two 5s."",
  ""So, we see that... Ask that question one more time."",
  ""So, let me break that down into sort of three buckets."",
  ""So, the first bucket, if I understand correctly, you're asking how much of the revenue is associated with the Ford?"",
  ""It would be less than a third."",
  ""So, on a typical season, like for example, the season that we're building out right now... Okay."",
  ""So, for the quarter, we showed $1.3 million, I believe, in this quarter."",
  ""Heather, correct me if I'm wrong or do – or is part of that coming in the October quarter?"",
  ""So, Steve, about – I'm going to say 50% or so of the naming rights were recognized so far."",
  ""The rest of it will be recognized in the fourth quarter."",
  ""But on a go-forward basis, Ford will be recognized to the tune of about $1.3 million annually."",
  ""And then in addition to that, will be the other four sponsorships, which would be the – which would be Kaiser."",
  ""And then, obviously, Air Academy Bank and then Coke and Budweiser."",
  ""Well, I appreciate it, Steve."",
  ""I mean, just to go back and talk a little bit about this, we're in the development stage and we're working hard on our P&L. And we believe that over the next six quarters, you will see it continue to do what it did this quarter."",
  ""And you'll see those operating profits continue to be what they are."",
  ""But you will also see the – to go back to the previous question as it relates to our balance sheet, you will see the acceleration of assets coming on to our balance sheet based on the public-private partnerships that we are currently developing."",
  ""So, I think what you're asking we recognize – we were able to recognize August and September."",
  ""So, two months' worth of the naming rights sponsorship.""

  ""We're here this morning to present the half year results for financial year 2025."",
  ""Myself, John Ions; Chief Financial Officer, Vinay Abrol; and Marketing, Simon Hildrey are here."",
  ""It's been a year of challenge and change within the industry and within Liontrust."",
  ""But we continue to strive to be the best we can and to stay true to our core beliefs of active management and excellence in brand and distribution."",
  ""We've diversified our product range."",
  ""We've broadened and strengthened our technological, data and digital capability to ensure we continue to serve our clients to the best standards and the standards they expect."",
  ""The highlights If I just If you look at the way our dividend is paid out, we have the interim now."",
  ""We're looking at a final year dividend of £0.50 in the summer."",
  ""This time in a year's time, we'd be following through with the next interim."",
  ""So, really the only strain on the dividend is about 20 months away."",
  ""And what we were keen to do by that is to give guidance that – it gives us time to look at the underlying performance of the business."",
  ""We'll go into reasons why we're confident that that position is maintainable, sustainable, but we wanted to move away from short-term comments about does the dividend also need to be cut or not."",
  ""So, in reality, it's a 20-month period If I now go into where the market backdrop is, asset management has been in a bad neighborhood really for the last couple of years, especially in active management, Interest rates, whilst coming down, have not come down as quickly."",
  ""And you can see from the high cash levels that are building up in banks that interest rates staying higher for longer has More specifically in the UK, having said at the time of the election, a Labor government coming in could be the opportunity to provide stability and direction for the UK economy."",
  ""In the run-up to the UK budget, so where there was much uncertainty, that uncertainty around tax, around how pensions would be treated and specifically So, through October, we saw a higher level of redemptions, predominantly from people taking The US election is behind us now and a lot more focus will be on the economic growth trajectory in the US, but probably a more domestic orientation So, that's where the headwinds are."",
  ""The opportunity side is we believe the outlook for active managers is looking much better."",
  ""And then, once you start to see that passive funds are now going So, I think the outlook is that attractive valuations exist, specifically in the UK."",
  ""And with a savings rate that continues to be too low at 8% I think that concentration and growth I'll hand over to Vinay now more for the financials."",
  "" And over the next slides, we'll maybe drill down into some of the teams, standout performance from the European Dynamic, from the Cashflow Solution's team, which also demonstrates the So, we have reasons to be optimist there for growth and the team."",
  ""The Global Innovation team, innovation and disruption and I talked about earlier and this Our Global Equities team, if I go back four, five years, we would have had a much higher bias of our total assets in UK equities."",
  ""One of the things we've tried to aim with Economic Advantage team, very much at the core."",
  ""We're facing the headwinds of the UK equity market, This is just to sort of highlight where those valuation opportunities exist, very much in the mid and small cap areas."",
  ""And all that is required is a small turn in sentiment, and you will well see some of these significant discounts to market levels start to come back into more realistic levels."",
  ""So, we do see this as an opportunity."",
  ""We manage one Multi-Asset, I think Vinay touched on, And with Sustainable, I think I think also the material scope to gain more further market share here, the FCA have put in or putting in place classifications ESG to remove greenwashing and green So, I think with the changes we've made across the business, the strong brand that we have, the high levels of engagement, we had – I think we had over 103 events The brand remains strong."",
  ""It is fourth out of 120 asset managers for communication And in summary, again, so we are very well-established business."",
  ""It's committed to two active fund management and best-in-class distribution."",
  ""That strong brand, excellent client engagement, I mean, impressive long-term performance track record and despite the headwinds for three years, the short-term performance over the last year with the outlook for active managers improving strongly going forward, I think, puts us as well-positioned to have the confidence where we are."",
  ""I think the improvements we've made to the business generate even more efficiency both financially and in harnessing data to be able to deliver."",
  ""The platform for the business is as strong and robust as ever."",
  ""Throughout this recorded presentation, investors will be in listen-only mode."",
  ""Questions are encouraged and they can be submitted at any time just by using the Q&A tab situated in the right-hand corner of your screen."",
  ""And I'd now like to hand you over to CEO, John Ions."",
  ""Maybe I'll pick up a few key points from our financial results for the period to 30 September."",
  ""I'll start with – and maybe just staying a few minutes on our capital position, given what John's talking about the dividend, the business remains in a very strong capital position."",
  ""So, our regulatory surplus capital is just under £60 million."",
  ""And even if you take into account the dividend – the first interim of dividend payable in January, we still have just under £50 million of surplus capital within the business."",
  ""So, we remain in a strong capital position with circa £90 million of cash on the balance sheet."",
  ""In terms of revenues, revenues were £81 million for the half year, which is down from the equivalent period last year."",
  ""But I just need to note, the equivalent period last year did have significant performance fees included, which were on a couple of funds which Overall, that has impacted our adjusted PBT."",
  ""So, adjusted PBT of £25.8 million, Again, the equivalent period last year and the full year number was around that 35% level."",
  ""Again, last year's half year number and the full year number both impacted by performance fees, If you look at our adjusted profit, just a bit more detail here."",
  ""I will just show the reconciliation between On the next slide, we've got the detailed adjusted income statement."",
  ""I'm not going to go through this line by line, but the key points here maybe are to look at costs."",
  ""We have been in an environment where revenues are down."",
  ""But our costs, both staff costs and other admin expenses, are both down circa 10%."",
  ""So, it shows, again, we are managing our costs well, and that's a credible performance in a high inflation evolvement, so where inflation has been coming down."",
  ""So, cost management has been strong both in terms of staff costs and in terms of The other thing I'll touch on is maybe the revenue margin."",
  ""So, you see the revenue margin is 60.3 basis points, which compares to last year's full year of 62 basis points."",
  ""We tend to guide that revenue margin will come down about 1 basis point or so, and this is really mostly related to revenue mix."",
  ""So, the mix last year, exiting the first half, had some higher margin products, where we have Again, here, just a bit more detail on the capital position for the business."",
  ""Again, as we – as mentioned earlier, we remain in a strong capital position with just under £60 million of surplus capital at the end of September."",
  ""I think if you take into account the dividend, which is paid in January, This slide just shows you our capital allocation framework."",
  ""So, for those of you who have seen us present before, you'll see that is a new line in the share buyback."",
  ""But in terms of how we allocate our capital in the business, obviously top priority is organic investment, organic UK business to run the business day to day and to expand that."",
  ""That is key purpose of capital that we have in the business."",
  ""We've instigated the share buyback program."",
  ""I'll touch on that more in a moment, but, okay, that is a new addition to our capital allocation framework."",
  ""So, we are – we have annually for many, many years taken the The business transformation program, I will – John has touched on this already."",
  ""If you look at the elements of the business transformation program, there's a number of But also, we've decided to merge our Global Fixed Income team into our Multi-Asset team and for Multi-Asset team to use the skill set that they have in the Global Fixed Income team to allocate their fixed income exposure to the in-house team, which Alpha is part of that team."",
  ""And again, that allows us to scale up our Fixed Income team, although revenue neutral, that would allow us to have larger, bigger fixed income funds to take out to the market."",
  ""Another key element of our business transformation is being the transformation of the operating platform that we have."",
  ""We've invested in both front office systems and data management partnering with BlackRock's Aladdin business and also taking further outsource services from BNY, Bank of New York, which gives us much The other element of the business transformation program, which we started in the second half, is the efficient management of the cost base."",
  ""A lot of the work that we've done in terms of making the business more efficient, in terms of that business transformation, reduce the product range, for me it's We've outlined that we're going to have a staff reduction of circa 25 people."",
  ""Some of these are as a result of the business transformation that we've done as we've outsourced the functions, relying more on BNY and other partners to do the work."",
  ""It allows us to reduce our head count and our cost and also So,""

  ""I think if we look at where we were if we go back a year ago, oh well, The only things we want to take place inside of our buildings are the things that we can add value on."",
  ""So, simple things like outsourcing factsheets to be able to get So, we've been able to reduce those costs."",
  ""We've made some changes on the sales team, but we've brought in three or four new people as well to enhance that dynamic and bring that forward."",
  ""And I've been delighted with what the sales team have achieved despite a very difficult three-year period for the business."",
  ""The level of client engagement we have, the communication and enthusiasm within that sales team is strong."",
  ""On the fund management side, no real difference in terms of head count came out out of the cost savings."",
  ""Those of you that know us will know that the fund managers have a revenue share and that revenue share is split between the members of the teams."",
  ""So, even if somebody was taken out of a fund management team, the revenue pool would remain the same."",
  ""It's just distributed between the people there."",
  ""Some of the costs come out from Our two largest With Sustainability, the interest rate sensitivity and maybe the more negative But I also touched on the debate between active and passive."",
  ""There comes a time when that list pricing becomes Yes."",
  ""In short, I think the industry probably has too many providers, too many unambitious providers."",
  ""It's always a difficult thing to sort of see where and what it is."",
  ""But definitely, with the challenging periods over the last sort of couple of years, I think people are beginning to question some of their business models, the ones that aren't as robust."",
  ""I mean, when I talked about us still maintaining an operating margin over 30%, some of them are very much in the low-teens It's got to be things that fit into our own  I think we've covered as much of it as we can."",
  ""If I can just say, I think it's been a challenging period, but I think the improvements we've made to the business on the operating platform, the strong brand, strong distribution and the improvement in the one-year performance, I think looking at a move away from relentless flows of passivesGreat."",
  ""If you would like to ask any questions, please do post them."",
  ""We do have two or three questions already."",
  ""So, do post any others."",
  ""John, Vinay, the – you talked about the cost savings."",
  ""You gave us some of the details."",
  ""Somebody is asking about the details, which I think Vinay's... Yeah. ..."",
  ""So, a follow-up question to that is, how does that affect Liontrust's ability to compete and to maintain profitability over the long term?"",
  ""I think I'll just add as well, we strongly feel that Great."",
  ""And you talked – John, you talked about the market context."",
  ""Can you – do you want to talk more about why our assets under management performed, is the question."",
  ""Can you talk about what we're doing to enhance profit, gross profit and post-tax profit?"",
  ""No, I think the key elements of that, the business transformation program has been a quick efficiency in our target operating model, which would help us keep our costs down."",
  ""And we're seeing some of that in our costs here compared to the equivalent period last year."",
  ""Non-legal costs coming down by about 10%."",
  ""The head count reduction, again, there are certain levers you can pull, so to increase your profit, I mean, is to increase your revenues and And John's already talked about the events and the efforts that we're putting in distribution to increase our net flows, which can certainly increase our revenues."",
  ""You can see from, again, some of the slides that we've shown earlier, performance has been improving."",
  ""We had a challenging 2022."",
  ""That's becoming more and more in the rearview mirror now."",
  ""The one-year numbers on a lot of our funds are looking pretty strong."",
  ""So, the building blocks of returning to net flows and growth in revenues are there."",
  ""But we still need to have that positive environment to get those flows."",
  ""So, I think on the revenue side, the engagement that we're doing, the changes we've made on the distribution side to make it more focused, I think, will pay off in the short, medium and long-term."",
  ""On the cost side, again, we're managing those costs."",
  ""So, we are – we're not sitting here So – but it's not all about closing funds."",
  ""We just launched three funds for our Innovation team in our Next question is often asked."",
  ""Do you see scope for consolidation in the industry?"",
  ""We've been asked what are Liontrust's key competitive advantages and how Great."",
  ""That brings the Q&A part of this presentation."",
  ""John, Vinay and Simon,  very much for answering those questions from investors."",
  ""Of course, the company can review all the questions submitted today, and we will publish such responses out on the Investor Meet Company platform."",
  ""Just before redirecting investors to provide you with their feedback, which I know is particularly important to the company, John, could I just ask you for a few closing comments?"",
  "" once again for updating investors today."",
  ""Could I please ask investors not to close the session, as you'll now be automatically redirected to provide your feedback in order that the management team can better understand your views and expectations?"",
  ""This will only take a few moments to complete, but I'm sure it'd be greatly valued by the company.""

  ""We're going to move to the mechanism of action and the groundbreaking discovery we announced recently that actually with the QPCTL or the isoQC as the enzyme, which is responsible for reducing kidney inflammation and fibrosis and that improves kidney function."",
  ""And as a short recap, the pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic peptides require largely pyroglutamization, that is a ring formed at the end terminal and of these peptides to become fully functional and potent."",
  ""And varoglutamstat is an inhibitor of that enzyme and therefore, the pyroglutamate peptides do not occur with same amount and are significantly reduced."",
  ""And there are various numbers of peptides, which are involved in the inflammation fibrotic cascade and then end up creating a kidney dysfunction, kidney fibrosis, and kidney insufficiencies."",
  ""And we have, in that slide, you can see below run and published animal experiments and pharmacology experiments, which show that we reduced the markers of inflammation, including pyroglu-CCL2, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha."",
  ""We can show that we reduced collagen 3, alpha-SMA, and CX3CL1, which are fibrotic markers and then, we can show that we improve eGFR and reduce urea and cystatin in these pharmacological models."",
  ""And based on this novel and groundbreaking discovery and mechanism, we now go to the VIVA-MIND US study design and see how that mechanism impacted on that US study."",
  ""The US study was an NIH-sponsored study for early AD and was a 1:1 randomization of patients between varoglutamstat and placebo."",
  ""And there were those funding elements included in that study in the sense that if the 600 milligram would not have been well tolerated in the DSMB interim analysis, then we would have dropped to 300 milligram and 150 milligram."",
  ""But we announced already about a year ago that the 600 milligram BID was well tolerated and could continue, and therefore no dose de-escalation to 300 milligram was needed or required."",
  ""And second quarter 2024, we decided together with the ADCS to terminate that study, because we saw in VIVIAD no efficacy in early Alzheimer's disease, and we did not deem it appropriate to continue the study in a nearly identical population with the same dose, just with different endpoints in this population."",
  ""And therefore, we have about 109 patients now allocated to placebo and to active instead of the finally planned 414 and 180 were planned to formal interim analysis."",
  ""So there were much less patients."",
  ""But that is quite important because we can see that with this little patient, we have highly significant eGFR patients."",
  ""Just to remind you of what that patients were, these were patients selected for early AD with an MMSE of 20 to 30 and a CDR sum of boxes between either 0.5 or 1 and an age of 50 to 89 years old."",
  ""And we had objective to look at the safety and tolerability, as well as efficacy for Alzheimer's disease, and the primary endpoint was CDR sum of boxes and that was different than the VIVIAD study, where we had a CogState NTB."",
  ""And then we had an interim preplanned analysis after 180 patients were treated for up to 24 weeks to look at interim efficacy using EEG and neuropsychological test battery."",
  ""Kidney function were prospectively defined, the eGFR being a safety parameter, and we did not change that because we didn't deemed it appropriate after we saw the VIVIAD data to do a last-minute post-hoc evaluation to efficacy."",
  ""We thought that is a kind of cheating."",
  ""Therefore, we left it as a safety perspective parameter, and as such, it is reported here."",
  ""So, going on, I just want to remind you that the top-line data as always are preliminary and maybe subject to minor changes on additional analysis and quality check, which you always have."",
  ""And so, that should not change the overall additional data, but there can be some numbers changing, of course, always to happen until we have final data."",
  ""Going to the next chart, this is the distribution of patients between active and placebo."",
  ""And it starts unfortunately with a little bit of a confusion, because we have 53 patients and 59 patients in – actually should be 58 and 52 and 57, and that is due to a patient, which was initially randomized to placebo, but got one single dose of varoglutamstat, which was an error, and administration error by the site, but it, of course, made the patient still in the efficacy group, in efficacy in placebo."",
  ""But for safety, you needed to put him into the varoglutamstat group because he had exposure to the drug."",
  ""That should not change any interpretation of the results, just a small detail."",
  ""So you see that the groups were well-equilibrated regarding sex and age."",
  ""The average treatment duration is probably quite important is 45 weeks."",
  ""In this study, the CDR sum of boxes at baseline was 3.35 and 2.99."",
  ""So, in the early stages, the eGFR was around 77 for both groups."",
  ""Then you see how the study rolled out, as it was planned to have evaluated by the 72 weeks in it, if it would be prematurely terminated."",
  ""We had only 25% to 33% completing the 72 weeks, and the rest of the patients were either prematurely terminated by the sponsors, that is our decision to stop the study, or by withdrawal of the subject, or all other together."",
  ""So we look here at data, which are, of course, much shorter and much smaller than in VIVIAD."",
  ""So we first of all want to discuss the results on Alzheimer's disease."",
  ""And at the pre-specified primary, key secondary, and relevant endpoint of ADAS-Cog, we saw no clinically meaningful and no statistically significant differences between varoglutamstat BID and placebo."",
  ""And I want to remind you that additional data will come, EEG, biomarker data in the CSF and in the blood, but they will only be available in the first quarter 2025."",
  ""In that respect, VIVA-MIND fully replicates the finding in VIVIAD, where we had the same outcome for Alzheimer's disease."",
  ""So, on the right side, you'll probably find some specifities of which I have already talked about."",
  ""So, we can jump to the next slide, which is the safety."",
  ""And we see in VIVA-MIND, a very good safety and tolerability profile."",
  ""We did not see any additional safety."",
  ""And here, it is important that VIVA-MIND exclusively used an accelerated fast titration regime starting at 150 milligrams and going to 300 and 600 milligrams, whereas VIVIAD started at 50 milligram and it took a longer time to come to 600 milligram."",
  ""So, it is a more convenient and accelerated regime we tested here, but it did not impact negatively on safety."",
  ""Actually, the safety arm quite equilibrated with a similar number of related treatment adverse events in both groups."",
  ""Also, by severity, there are no major differences."",
  ""Also, the serious and the related serious treatment emergent – adverse event didn't show any difference."",
  ""And there is also for patients this drug modification has no difference, and for drug discontinuation, there is a minor difference, but not a lot."",
  ""I want to remember or tell you that there were two patients dying, which were unrelated to the drug in the study, one because of the gastrointestinal bleeding and the surgery for this and the complication of the surgery thereafter, which happened many weeks after stopping of treatment, and the second patient having a fall down the stairs and having a patient provision not to have intensive Then, we come now in the next slide to the kidney data."",
  ""And we see here on the left side the difference between placebo and active for the totality of all patients and all visits."",
  ""So, what we did here is we simply took all the data around the treatment and subtracted active and placebo and that is the difference between it."",
  ""So, you see it's a little bit about 4 milliliter average difference across all visit and each visit, active is better than placebo."",
  ""And that is highly significant as you see with the p-value."",
  ""And as said, that is all patients and all visits."",
  ""So, there's no subgroups, no division, no post hoc here."",
  ""That is the totality of the data."",
  ""And then, you look on the right side, where we divided the efficacy parameter in two periods, one in the starting period where the drug was titrated and a little afterwards of the titration that is between week 4 and 16."",
  ""And you see that the effect size versus placebo is already significant, but with around 3 milliliter or 3.3 milliliter, of course, much smaller than later between weeks 24 and 72 where you basically reach a plateau of efficacy of above 5 milliliter difference of active versus placebo."",
  ""What it means is that each of these visits, the average of the active was more than 5 milliliter better than the average of placebo."",
  ""And that's, of course, a huge effect size, which is three to four times higher than everything you saw with approved drugs used for the treatment of kidney diseases these days."",
  ""We want to dive a little bit in the sustainability and – no, here on this slide, sorry."",
  ""This is, first of all, the slide where we compare two calculations as we did in VIVIAD."",
  ""So, we look MDRD and CKD-EPI."",
  ""And while there is a little bit of difference, the significance level and the effect size is very comparable."",
  ""It's just a different formula to make sure that we are not facing only one thing and forget another one."",
  ""You see that this data is robust, comparable, and consistent."",
  ""Next, now going to the comparison of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND because in the following charts, I want to present you a little bit more about the consistency between the VIVIAD and the VIVA-MIND study."",
  ""So, first, before we go to the data, we need to understand that the studies have similarity and differences."",
  ""So, the study completion, of course, VIVA-MIND is smaller data set as a discontinued study and VIVIAD is a completed study as per protocol."",
  ""The mean age is quite comparable in VIVA-MIND, but a little bit older than in VIVIAD."",
  ""And we saw that the upper age range in VIVA-MIND was 89, whereas in VIVIAD it was 80, so that is expected."",
  ""The number of patients treated, as I said, is smaller in VIVA-MIND and VIVIAD by 2.5-fold actually."",
  ""In VIVA-MIND, we only tested 600 milligram as explained because we did not need to down-escalate the study, whereas in VIVIAD we tested up from 300 milligram and 600 milligram and then besides these, we decided that 600 milligram is good and we moved everybody to 600 milligram."",
  ""The dose escalation is different."",
  ""So, in VIVA-MIND, we started fast with a 150 milligram BID and we reached 600 milligram at week nine, whereas in VIVIAD we started slow with 50 milligram and we reached 600 milligram at week 13, so four weeks later."",
  ""Mean treatment duration was also shorter in VIVA-MIND than in VIVIAD 46 and 76 weeks or you can put it in other words, the longest treatment duration in VIVA-MIND is 72 weeks is still four weeks shorter than the average in VIVIAD."",
  ""So, we have a shorter treatment set."",
  ""And based on this result – based on these facts, the results are actually, I think, mind-blowing in terms of the robustness and consistency."",
  ""The number of patients with eGFR results week 36 and later was 73 – sorry, excuse me, 73 in VIVA-MIND and 246 in VIVIAD, so about a third with long-term data."",
  ""And when you now compare what the results are between VIVA-MIND and VIVIAD and you compare comparable patients, meaning only patients treated with 600 milligram at – in VIVIAD and of course all of VIVA-MIND, you see that numerically there's even a slight advantage for VIVA-MIND, but overall, it's pretty consistent around 5 or above 5 milliliter average benefit in the period, where you have a stable dose range."",
  ""So, visits 24 to 72 Next?"",
  ""And here is what I announced before."",
  ""We look at week 60s and 72s because what is important not only is to see the effect size, but also whether this effect size is sustained across the whole study."",
  ""So, on the left part of the chart, you see the week 60 results."",
  ""That means, we compare here the effect size observed only at that single visit."",
  ""And you see in VIVA-MIND, we had about 5.5 milliliter and with VIVIAD, we had about 4.5 milliliter."",
  ""And of course, in VIVA-MIND, we have much less patient at that time point than in VIVIAD."",
  ""And of course, here, we also only compare the 600 milligrams."",
  ""And on the right side, you have the 72 weeks results, which are the last visits in the VIVA-MIND study, but it's not the last visit in the VIVIAD study because you know VIVIAD went up to week 96."",
  ""But we compared week 72 in both studies just to see how the effect is sustained in VIVA-MIND and VIVIAD."",
  ""And what you see is despite only having 13 and 20 patients in VIVA-MIND at that time point, we have a p-value of 0.002 and an effect size at that visit day of more than 6-milliliter difference between active and placebo."",
  ""And in VIVIAD, the data were correspondingly a little bit above 5 milliliter and also statistically significant."",
  ""So what we can conclude from that analysis that in both studies, the effect size was sustained in the midst of the second year."",
  ""Until the end of the second year, there was no lowering or reducing of the efficacy over time."",
  ""The efficacy was fully maintained and that was significant until the last visit."",
  ""I want to summarize the finding of our Phase 2 program in this chart."",
  ""We now have two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, one conducted in Western Europe and one in US, totally different investigation sites, totally different CROs who is not connected to each other, and both show a consistent, very comparable, statistically significant, and clinically meaningful improvement for eGFR for varoglutamstat versus placebo."",
  ""In both studies, eGFR was improved above baseline and stabilized across the whole treatment period for up to 96 and 72 weeks, respectively."",
  ""These results provide a robust, and I want to send a very robust evidence of the treatment benefits."",
  ""We have good safety results in VIVA-MIND with the accelerated dose escalation scheme, and that provides a very good pathway for a convenient and commercially viable dosage schedule."",
  ""And what is also important looking forward is that VIVA-MIND, with this small patient number of 109 patients, of course, support the sample size planning of 120 patients or less for the next planned study in diabetic kidney disease, which we announced before."",
  ""And so, the sample size assessment we did before, I think, was very solid and probably we need a couple of less patients, but we will follow up on this in a later conference when we have fully digested the VIVA-MIND data."",
  ""So, we will continue to analyze the data."",
  ""We are here at top line-only data, first view on it."",
  ""And with that, I want to hand over back to Anne."",
  ""This morning, Vivoryon issued a press release reporting its nine-month 2024 financial results and also provided an update on our progress, which was marked by compelling kidney function data as well as execution of important steps in implementing our strategy to advance varoglutamstat in kidney disease."",
  ""This press release is posted on Vivoryon's website at www.vivoryon.com."",
  ""On the call with me today are Vivoryon's Chief Executive Officer, Frank Weber."",
  ""Our Chief Business Officer, Michael Schaeffer, is also available for Q&A. We will begin today's call with opening remarks from myself, giving you an overview of the key highlights from the third quarter and post-period updates, after which we will move to Frank who will provide some details on the exciting news update we announced yesterday, which is a positive kidney function data from our VIVA-MIND Phase 2 study."",
  ""I will then review the financial results for the third quarter of 2024 and conclude the call with an overview of our corporate outlook and strategic update."",
  ""Following the prepared remarks, we will host a Q&A session."",
  ""I would like to remind you that during this conference call, we will present and discuss certain forward-looking statements concerning the development of Vivoryon's core platform, the progress of its current research and development programs, and the initiation of additional programs, as well as results of operations, cash needs, financial condition, liquidity, prospects, future transactions, and strategies."",
  ""Should actual results differ from the company's assumptions, ensuing actions may differ from those anticipated."",
  ""You are therefore cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof."",
  ""For those that have been following Vivoryon over the last months, you know this has been a period of major change for the company."",
  ""Since March of this year, we have step-by-step rolled out the strategic shift to kidney disease and in particular have presented to you the results from two Phase 2 studies demonstrating varoglutamstat's potential to beneficially impact kidney function, which provide the foundation for this new path forward."",
  ""Now, shifting to the third quarter and post-period updates, clearly, the biggest development is of course the topline VIVA-MIND data we disclosed yesterday, which shows a highly significant improvement of eGFR versus placebo, confirming VIVIAD eGFR results and providing a second Phase 2 long-term data set."",
  ""Frank will walk you through these data in detail shortly and show you why we can confidently say now that with the strong data package generated to-date for varoglutamstat in kidney, we have a unique chance to become a key part of the treatment landscape for a number of diseases with high unmet medical need."",
  ""Another important development in the third quarter was our presentation at ASN."",
  ""We were thrilled that kidney outcome results from our VIVIAD Phase 2 study were selected for a late-breaking oral presentation at ASN Kidney Week, which is the world's premier nephrology meeting."",
  ""Frank's presentation was very well-received, and we have been extremely encouraged by the positive reactions we received from the community."",
  ""Vivoryon hosted a Virtual Kidney Disease KOL event in September, during which the experts provided insights into the limitations of current standard of care and new developments in kidney disease."",
  ""They outlined that novel medicines are needed with MoA-suitable to addressing the kidney, the key inflammatory and fibrotic pathways underlying this disease and the potential of varoglutamstat in this space."",
  ""So, as you can see, once again, we've had a very active reporting period marked by continued strong progress in advancing varoglutamstat for kidney disease and are poised to enter 2025 with positive momentum."",
  ""With that, I will now turn the call over to Frank."",
  ""Let me take you through the key figures for the period."",
  ""R&D expenses in the first nine months of 2024 amounted to €12.6 million versus €10.4 million in the same period of 2023."",
  ""This increase of €2.2 million was largely attributable to the increase in clinical costs from the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies, as well as investments in the kidney-related research and analysis."",
  ""We have seen a decrease in G&A expenses with costs of €4.9 million in the first nine months of 2024, compared to €6.8 million in the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""This €1.9 million decrease was largely attributable to higher compensation of non-executive board members in 2023."",
  ""All of this resulted in a net loss for the first nine months of 2024 of €17.1 million, the same amount as we had in the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""The company held €12.5 million in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, compared to €28.6 million, which includes cash and cash equivalents and term deposits within financial assets as of December 31, 2023."",
  ""Cash utilization for the first nine months of 2024 reflects the intensive investment period in VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND, especially in the first six months of the year, both of which are expected to continue to ramp down in the months ahead as both studies conclude."",
  ""Our reduction in cash and cash equivalents for the third quarter was less than half seen in each of the first and second quarter."",
  ""We updated our financial guidance and expect our cash and cash equivalents being sufficient to fund our operating plan into the third quarter of 2025."",
  ""Looking ahead into the upcoming months, we will continue to thoroughly analyze the VIVA-MIND data and expect to disclose additional results, including biomarker data related to varoglutamstat's unique MoA, as well as preclinical data on orphan kidney diseases biomarker data related to varoglutamstat, unique MoA, as well as preclinical data on orphan kidney diseases from our scientific collaboration."",
  ""In 2025, Vivoryon plans to start a Phase 2 study in DKD, which we have outlined previously and see as the next natural step given the strong VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND data."",
  ""Depending on anticipated preclinical results from our collaboration with Professor Huber, Director of the III, Department of Medicine, UKE Hamburg-Eppendorf, we are also looking into potentially launching a small orphan disease study."",
  ""As a reminder, all potential future clinical studies are subject to additional funding and our partnership, which we continue to actively explore."",
  ""Beyond 2025, we anticipate upcoming meaningful milestones to include interim and full data read-outs from the planned DKD Phase 2 study, which we have also outlined previously in detail."",
  ""So, as you can see, we have lots in store for 2025 and beyond that will build on our current momentum."",
  ""I'd like to conclude by reiterating that despite the setback in AD earlier this year, we have been able to successfully generate compelling efficacy and safety data and people at risk of kidney disease from two independent, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 2 studies, and we are now very well set up to become a key part of the treatment landscape for a number of diseases affecting the kidney with high unmet medical need."",
  ""Backed by our strong scientific foundation, varoglutamstat's novel mechanism of action and confirmed target engagement, the extensive safety data package with convenient dose escalation scheme, as well as compelling dose-dependent long-term kidney function improvement, we have a focused development plan in place."",
  ""Furthermore, based on new filings, we anticipate composition of matter patent protection to be extended to beyond 2044."",
  ""In addition, we have been active in strengthening our patent protection in the kidney field in general."",
  ""We actively pursue – pursuing funding in BD opportunities to realize the full potential of the significant commercial opportunity in DKD and beyond."",
  ""With that, we will now open the call to take questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions, and congratulations on the encouraging data."",
  ""Just a couple for me."",
  ""Firstly, can we expect any additional subgroup analysis from the VIVA-MIND study or any additional data on transaminase levels or weight loss, diastolic blood pressure?"",
  ""And any of those would be great."",
  ""And yeah, any further analysis that we can expect on both of the trials?"",
  ""And then, the second question is just on the kidney opportunities outside of diabetic kidney disease, such as Fabry disease."",
  ""Has the preclinical analysis started or is this subject to additional funding?"",
  ""Sorry, and just on the opportunities outside of diabetic kidney disease, are there any updates on that front?"",
  ""Hi,  for taking my questions."",
  ""So, just following on from that you mentioned that there was a small proportion of patients with diabetic kidney disease in this study, can you tell us how many, if any, patients did have diabetic kidney disease across the two arms?"",
  ""And then, just related to that, any of the patients were they on concomitant SGLT2 or GLP-1s both within VIVA-MIND and in the VIVIAD study?"",
  ""And then, just on the final comment or comment toward the end about extending the composition of matter IP, just what's driving confidence that that will be feasible for varoglutamstat?"",
  "" for taking my questions, and congrats on this positive consistent data."",
  ""Just on the plan for the Phase 2 DKD study, the fact that you've seen that these data are quite consistent with VIVA-MIND – VIVIAD, does that change the plan in any way, the recruitment size, or any factors of that study?"",
  ""And then secondly, on the cash runway, the streamlining that you've been doing to extend it, has that affected any of the preclinical work that you're doing?"",
  ""Is there anything there that's now not being explored that was previously part of the program?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""First of all, of course, congrats on the data confirming your earlier findings."",
  ""And my first question, in terms of the VIVA-MIND study analysis, what are the main motives behind withdrawal by the subjects themselves?"",
  ""Yeah, if you could elaborate on that."",
  ""And in terms maybe a question more for Anne, in terms of the expenses over the next quarters, what can we expect here?"",
  ""And when will the – is that the VIVA-MIND's trial completely terminated altogether or when will that happen?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""So, first of all, we are – as you said, we are the beginning of the analysis of VIVA-MIND."",
  ""We are happy that VIVA-MIND is consistent with VIVIAD."",
  ""But of course, we are not through all the analysis of VIVA-MIND."",
  ""We've just started with it."",
  ""So, we will take our Christmas holidays and dig into the data and come up with all the things you have asked for."",
  ""And yeah, of course, they will be published as said and disclosed at the next webcast and press release."",
  ""And the same is true for diabetic kidney disease."",
  ""We are convinced that this is a very good indication based on VIVIAD."",
  ""We still need to do some analysis in VIVA-MIND."",
  ""But there are not so many patients with diabetes in VIVA-MIND."",
  ""So, let's see what that brings."",
  ""But given the overall result are positive, I expect that similar things would happen for diabetic patients."",
  ""But I haven't seen the data personally, so I cannot make any promises to be very clear."",
  ""But we are looking forward to looking – to dig deep into the data and come back to you with all the results we will have."",
  ""Did I answer your question or was that not what you asked?"",
  ""We have not yet the updates on the orphans and other indications, but we will work on this and we will come relatively short in this."",
  ""These are partially academic collaboration, but not necessarily run by the week, probably more by the month."",
  ""And so, we are ourselves waiting for that."",
  ""I don't know any update material on this, but it will come."",
  ""Do you want to start, Mike, with the IP?"",
  ""Maybe I can add to this."",
  ""We're – I mean, filing a patent to get it approved is a process."",
  ""That process runs as by the books."",
  ""And we will have some updates in the future of this once there is the time to update you on this."",
  ""It's probably not too far away."",
  ""So, of course, until that point is happening, we cannot give you any information."",
  ""But we are in the process as it should be and there are no bad surprises so far."",
  ""As you know, we are patenting the compound we're using under a specific contingency, I would say."",
  ""And that was a genius move from the past, and I think we let it there until we can fully speak about it in the public."",
  ""And regarding diabetes patients, I mean, the process we do is that we, by hand, check the identification of diabetes and pre-diabetes patients, and we are currently trying to understand what is a pre-diabetic patient, so some with disturbed hypoglycemia or hypoglycemia and disturbed glucose tolerance versus a full diabetic patients."",
  ""We expect the number of full diabetic patients to be something between 10 and 20, but that separation is currently ongoing to really identify the groups properly and to ring fence the number."",
  ""So, I cannot give you a more precise number because while a patient may have a history of diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance that needs to be checked with the laboratory data and the concomitant medication and the history accurately."",
  ""And we have topline data now."",
  ""So, we are, from a timing perspective, not fully through this."",
  ""So, I cannot give you more precise information on this."",
  ""And, of course, we will disclose the concomitant medication."",
  ""But the patients who had diabetes, those had the typical co-medications, including some patients with SGLT2s."",
  ""I have to wait until the data are fully mature in QC."",
  ""Was that... So, we actually did more in kidney than we ever planned."",
  ""But of course, there are limitations because as you can imagine, the opportunities are infinitive to do exploratory pharmacology in animals or in cells."",
  ""You could do thousands of things, but we have neither the manpower, not the money to do everything, but all the critical activities have been started, and we have restricted the evidence generation in non-clinical based on our financial situation."",
  ""Of course, we are careful with our spending, but that doesn't mean that in that area, we would have restricted."",
  ""What we have be restricted is investments in Alzheimer's disease, clearly because currently, we have with these results and VIVA-MIND confirmed with the current dosing regimen, no way forward for Alzheimer's disease."",
  ""Now we are looking, of course, in alternative options, but the mainstream is diabetic kidney disease and the experiments for kidney disorders are fully run."",
  ""The other thing of the sample size, as I've announced, we have not recalculated sample size based on the VIVA-MIND results and the consistency thereof."",
  ""And that is because the results are fresh from the press."",
  ""And we could not make a statistical model, including VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND data."",
  ""As you see, they are totally homogeneous."",
  ""There's no difference between the data that, of course, would facilitate, or no meaningful difference between the data."",
  ""Of course, there's minor differences, sorry."",
  ""I have to correct this, but there's no meaningful difference between the data."",
  ""So that helps, of course, planning the next study, and probably will more reduce the sample size needed."",
  ""But on the other hand, we don't want to do a totally minimalistic study."",
  ""That means our aim is not to invest as little money as possible, because we want to have a meaningful study and robust data at the end."",
  ""So, a too small study may not be convincing either."",
  ""Even from a statistical point of view, it would be feasible, but I would not recommend to go down to a minimum."",
  ""So we try to find that good balance between evidence generation and statistical sample size."",
  ""And I think we are in a good spot to assume that 120 patients are the max, max, max, and likely it will go more down."",
  ""But if it's too small, then of course, everybody scratches their head, even with a p-value of the relevance of this."",
  ""So that's a little bit between the two where we are trying to find a solution in upcoming weeks, and then, of course, the final product will have to go again through the KOLs and need to be tested, and then we're going to publish it and discuss it with you."",
  ""This is an Alzheimer's study, and it's done in the US, and you know that the distances from study sites to where the people live are meaningful."",
  ""And if the patient, the burden of the study is much higher than the patients thought initially, or they have problems with the relatives taking care of them, patients drop out."",
  ""The other part, which was a withdrawal reason, is that lecanemab became commercial in the midst of the study, and we had a couple of patients who elected to leave the double-blind placebo-controlled study because they could be on placebo for one and a half years and elected to go to commercially available lecanemab, which was at that time approved."",
  ""So, we had a couple of those and that explains a little bit the number."",
  ""Probably to be a little bit more concrete, we haven't paid every single VIVA-MIND."",
  ""There are still some remaining expenses coming also because there are additional subgroup things and statistics and so on."",
  ""So, there will be some more expenses."",
  ""But I think, the vast majority, of course, of the costs have already been paid."",
  ""So, there are some things to come, but that largely Phase 2 program is paid, a little bit to come."",
  ""And then, we have the typical operational expenses of the company, plus some non-clinical activities for the kidney disorders So, that's probably it."",
  ""But our confidence in financial planning and the team's financial capabilities is good."",
  ""And this is why we made today the announcement that through the third quarter cash report we have today is really bad."",
  ""First of all, I want to  for your attendance, and I want to close with the remarks that repetition and replication is the name of the game, and consistency of data is really important to make scientific and medical judgment and look at the scientific merits of the data."",
  ""I think we are largely through a transformation of the company from a hopeful Alzheimer's disease to a validated and confirmed kidney company with additional opportunities."",
  ""So, having seen that in very well-conducted, high-quality, robust randomized, placebo-controlled studies, which both are long term of 72 And with that, I wish you a very happy festive period and Christmas period and a good relaxation period and see you back next year."",
  ""As you've seen the progression of our sort of cash burn or cash usage over the entire year so far has gone progressively down."",
  ""So, we've had a lot of expenses in the first six months of the year related to VIVA-MIND and VIVIAD."",
  ""And then, you've seen a stepdown in the third quarter."",
  ""And so, as those studies do come to a conclusion, we should see that ramping down."",
  ""And we've also had the additional update today of our guidance into the third quarter and that also reflects that ramp down.""

  ""During our fiscal fourth quarter and through today, we have continued to execute our plan and accomplished key milestones regarding commercialization, product development and financial objectives."",
  ""In 2024, our top priorities were to pursue a 510(k) clearance from the FDA to market our OneRF Ablation System and to secure a strategic partnership for distribution."",
  ""While there was risk associated with the 510(k) given there were no other devices with such a clearance, we successfully achieved this objective, as well as securing a strategic partnership to distribute the system."",
  ""We are proud that the OneRF Ablation System is the first and only FDA-cleared system with an intended use for both Our recent announcement regarding the extension of the partnership with Zimmer Biomet provides a broad distribution network for both the US and certain We are also protect projecting gross margins for fiscal year 2025 to range between 47% and 51% compared to gross margins of 31% in 2024."",
  ""We are very happy to be reporting strong annual revenue growth in fiscal 2024 and expect our revenue growth and margin improvement to accelerate in 2025."",
  ""We have also been able to strengthen our balance sheet with the $3 million license payment from Zimmer Biomet, along with the improved product gross margins from the expanded Zimmer Biomet partnership, as well as the $2.65 million private placement completed in August."",
  ""Regarding the launch of the OneRF Ablation System, we have been working very closely with the Zimmer Biomet team to initiate commercialization activities, including initial product shipments and training of Zimmer Biomet personnel."",
  ""Physician interest has been very strong, including during the product exhibition at the American Epilepsy Society meeting last week."",
  ""We were also very happy to report that OneRF ablation procedures have now been completed in 12 patients, and to date, all patients are either seizure free or have had a significant reduction in seizure occurrence and less severe seizures after the OneRF ablation procedure."",
  ""We continue to be overwhelmed with the initial results and have now performed more than 150 RF ablations on 12 patients in five centers during our initial limited launch."",
  ""To date, 24 epilepsy centers have requested proposals to acquire the technology, which doubled from last quarter, and we continue to receive strong interests from neurosurgeons and neurologists regarding the technology."",
  ""We are also happy to report that the new ICD-10-PCS code granted by CMS for the OneRF ablation procedure became effective October 1, 2024 and will allow hospitals to report inpatient procedures that are performed using the OneRF Ablation System."",
  ""This will serve to support accurate data collection and processing of reimbursement claims by hospitals for the procedure."",
  ""Turning to our product development programs, I am excited to announce that we are pursuing additional applications for RF ablation outside of the brain."",
  ""Our next FDA submission will target patients with debilitating facial pain, also known as trigeminal neuralgia."",
  ""The trigeminal nerve is located in the face with one nerve on each side of the face."",
  ""Trigeminal neuralgia is also a chronic pain condition and is characterized by severe, sudden and recurrent facial pain with over 150,000 patients diagnosed each year in the United States."",
  ""We expect to submit our 510(k) application to the FDA in the first half of calendar year 2025 with the potential to contribute to revenue in calendar year 2025, that is not currently factored in to our 2025 revenue plan or revenue guidance."",
  ""We remain convinced that the OneRF Ablation System can serve as a platform technology for additional indications such as RF ablation for lower back pain and knee pain, among others."",
  ""We believe that having multiple indications for a OneRF Ablation System provides competitive differentiation compared to a single function system and will offer added value to hospitals and physicians, which can be a consideration in hospital purchasing decisions."",
  ""I would also like to provide updates on our product development programs Based on the strong feedback from our advisory board, we initiated discussions with potential strategic partners and are actively exploring partnerships for this technology."",
  ""This technology is another great example of our novel thin film technology that can be applied for multiple indications, including not only back and neck pain, but also for other potential peripheral pain applications."",
  ""We are also making significant progress with our sEEG-based drug delivery program, which leverages the small size and easy Going forward, we will be preparing a 510(k) application for sEEG-based drug delivery, as well as developing a miniaturized device for use in preclinical research."",

  ""Finally, we intend to continue actively monitoring the closing bid price for our common stock between now and January 7, 2025, and will consider all available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement."",
  ""I would now like to turn the call over to Ron McClurg to provide a review of our fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 financial results."",
  ""In closing, we are very happy with the progress made in fiscal 2024 and are looking forward to driving accelerated revenue growth and margin improvement in 2025."",
  ""We now have clear near-term growth drivers, as well as a strong product pipeline leveraging our novel platform technology."",
  ""In the near term, we are well positioned to drive meaningful revenue growth and margin improvement having just completed the first shipments to Zimmer Biomet of the OneRF Ablation System, the first and only FDA-cleared device for RF ablation in the brain."",
  ""We also expect our trigeminal nerve indication to be commercialized potentially in calendar year 2025 and we are continuing to make progress on product development milestones and potential strategic partnerships for our drug delivery and spinal cord stimulation programs."",
  ""I would like to thank everyone for attending the call and look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter."",
  ""Product revenue was $0.3 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, compared to $0.7 million in the prior year fourth quarter."",
  ""The reduction in product revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was due to the company's cancellation of a Zimmer Biomet purchase order in order to transition our manufacturing to the new OneRF product line."",
  ""Product revenue increased 77% to $3.5 million in fiscal year 2024, compared to $2 million in fiscal year 2023."",

  ""We are extremely pleased with our fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024 results."",
  ""For the full year, net revenue grew 6% to a record $191.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $26.7 million compared to a loss of $224,000 for fiscal year 2023."",
  ""We achieved avocado and lemon volume guidance for the year."",
  ""In fact, the 15.1 million pounds of avocados sold in fiscal year 2024 was the most volume sold in almost 15 years."",
  ""These overall results demonstrate the strength of our agricultural platform, and validate our strategic decision to expand our avocado production by 1,000 acres through fiscal year 2027, which is expected to drive significant EBITDA growth."",
  ""In addition, our lemon offering is achieving increased penetration in the foodservice and quick service restaurant channels."",
  ""And we expect more meaningful market penetration in fiscal year 2025."",
  ""Our agricultural success, combined with a compelling portfolio of real estate assets, valuable water resources and a strong balance sheet, create multiple potential pathways to build lasting stockholder value."",
  ""As an example, our residential joint venture with the Lewis Group of Companies for the Harvest real estate development project continues to perform very well, and we anticipate meaningful water monetization transactions in fiscal year 2025."",
  ""In addition, we continue to explore strategic alternatives for our assets and are very pleased with the interest."",
  ""We remain committed to thoroughly exploring all options to maximize stockholder value and we'll provide updates, if the Board of Directors find that further disclosure is necessary or advisable."",
  ""In fiscal year 2024, we achieved two significant real estate milestones."",
  ""First, in April, our joint venture with Lewis closed on lot sales, representing 554 residential units, thus completing the sellout of Phase 2 of the development."",
  ""A total of 1,261 residential units have closed from the project's inception."",
  ""Second, in May, we announced that the Santa Paula City Council approved the joint venture's proposal to increase the total number of residential units for the project from 1,500 to 2,050 units."",
  ""The 550 unit increase will provide 250 additional single family for-sale home sites within Phase 3 of Harvest."",
  ""A separate joint venture with Lewis plans to construct 300 multifamily rental homes on a mixed use portion of the project."",
  ""This is a 37% increase in dwelling units, unlocking further value creation opportunities."",
  ""Based on these events and the expected continued increase in land value associated with this project, we increased our cash flow projections by 46% in June and expect to receive $180 million in total proceeds spread out over seven fiscal years, with $15 million received this year."",
  ""In addition, in December of 2024, we received approval from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, to revise a flood zone map area effective May 15, 2025 that significantly reduces the number of property owners that are required to pay flood insurance within East Area I, East Area II and other real estate within the flood zone area west of Santa Paula Creek."",
  ""Within East Area I, approximately 1,100 existing and future residents will not be subject to mandatory flood insurance due to the revised flood zone map."",
  ""It has been a time of intensive process as we have been working with various public agencies since 2020 to correct the FEMA flood zone insurance rate map."",
  ""Revising the flood zone map is expected to improve future interest in residential and commercial real estate in these zones as it removes the concern of flooding and the cost of mandatory flood insurance."",
  ""Turning to our balance sheet, our net debt as of October 31, 2024 was $37.6 million."",
  ""Additionally, our 50/50 real estate development joint venture had $66.9 million of cash and cash equivalents as of October 31, 2024, of which 50% is approximately $33.5 million."",
  ""The joint venture currently has no debt."",
  ""We consider this approximately $33.5 million as an offset to our net debt position of $37.6 million."",
  ""Now, I'll provide a quick update on our decision to evaluate strategic alternatives for the overall business."",
  ""Today, we consider ourselves to be a very strong financial position, having recently reduced our net debt position to right size the balance sheet through our ongoing strategic shift towards an asset-lighter business model and with stronger cash flow projections from Harvest at Limoneira."",
  ""Since announcing our exploration of strategic alternatives, we have received significant interest and are diligently working with our advisors to evaluate these potential opportunities."",
  ""We remain committed to thoroughly exploring all options to maximize stockholder value, and will provide updates, if the Board of Directors find that further disclosure is necessary or advisable."",
  ""Even after the recent non-strategic asset sales over the past year and a half, we continue to manage approximately 10,500 acres of land with approximately 21,000 acre feet of owned water usage and pumping rates, representing tremendous long-term value growth opportunities from our assets."",
  ""You can see, by our improvement in agribusiness operating income during the fourth quarter and full year, our transition to an asset-lighter business model and focus on the best use of our assets to enhance stockholder value is having a positive effect."",
  ""We removed our pension obligation, achieved our significantly increased volume guidance for fiscal year 2024, and are monetizing water through a fallowing program with the Yuma Mesa Irrigation and Drainage Ditch (sic) [District] (00:09:20)."",
  ""And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Mark."",
  ""We expect fresh lemon volumes to be in the range of 5 million to 5.5 million cartons for fiscal year 2025, and expect avocado volumes to be in the range of 7 million to 8 million pounds for fiscal year 2025."",
  ""In addition, we now expect to receive total proceeds of $180 million from Harvest LLCB II and LLC and East Area II, spread out over seven fiscal years with $15 million received in fiscal year 2024."",
  ""Looking ahead, we continue to see a strong EBITDA outlook underpinned by plans to expand avocado production by 1,000 acres through fiscal year 2027 to capitalize on robust consumer demand trends."",
  ""During this transition, the company expects fiscal year 2025 avocado volume to be lower compared to fiscal year 2024 due to the alternate bearing nature of avocado trees."",
  ""These operational results do not take into account anticipated additional gains from asset monetization."",
  ""Operator, we'll now open the call to questions."",
  ""On the call are Harold Edwards, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Palamountain, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""By now, everyone should have access to the fourth quarter fiscal year 2024 , which went out today at approximately 4:00 PM Eastern Time."",
  ""If you've not had a chance to review the release, it's available on the Investor Relations portion of the company's website at limoneira.com."",
  ""This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on Limoneira's website as well."",
  ""Before we begin, we'd like to remind everyone that prepared remarks contain forward-looking statements, and management may make additional forward-looking statements in response to your questions."",
  ""Such statements involve a number of known and unknown risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside the company's control and could cause its future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from the results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements."",
  ""Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences, including risks detailed in the company's Form 10-Q and 10-K as filed with the SEC and those mentioned in the ."",
  ""Except as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking or other statements herein, whether a result of new information, future events or otherwise."",
  ""Please note that during today's call we will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures, including results on an adjusted basis."",
  ""We believe these adjusted financial measures can facilitate a more complete analysis and greater understanding of Limoneira's ongoing results of operations, particularly when comparing underlying results from period to period."",
  ""We have provided as much detail as possible on any items that are discussed on an adjusted basis."",
  ""Also, in the company's  and in today's prepared remarks, we included adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP financial measures."",
  ""A reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted diluted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the company's press release, which has been posted to its website."",
  ""And with that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to the company's President and CEO, Mr. Harold Edwards."",
  ""To best gauge our performance, we encourage viewing our business on an annual basis, given our natural seasonality with Q2 and Q3 historically stronger, and Q1 and Q4 more moderate."",
  ""For the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, total net revenue increased 6% to $43.9 million, compared to total net revenue of $41.4 million in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal year."",

  ""Approximately 470,000 cartons of US packed fresh lemons were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 at a $17.95 average price per carton, compared to 550,000 cartons sold at a $20.39 average price per carton during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023."",
  ""During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, our lemon volume was impacted by lower fresh utilization rates due to weather-driven events, coupled with the delayed start to the desert region harvest period."",
  ""Brokered lemons and other lemon sales were $14.6 million and $13.2 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively, representing 11% growth year over year."",
  ""The company recognized $8.9 million of avocado revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to no avocado revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023 due to the biannual nature of this fruit."",
  ""Approximately 4.6 million pounds of avocados were sold in aggregate during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024 at a $1.92 average price per pound."",
  ""The company recognized $1.7 million of orange revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $1.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023."",
  ""Approximately 91,000 cartons of oranges were sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, at an average of $18.99 price per carton, compared to approximately 69,000 carton sold at a $28.32 average price per carton during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023."",
  ""As a reminder, the company opportunistically has buy/sell arrangements for orange orders with our retail and foodservice customers to complement our lemon sales."",
  ""Specialty citrus and other crop revenue was $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024, compared to $6.5 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2023."",
  ""The decrease was primarily due to decreased volume of specialty citrus sold and decreased wine grape revenue."",
  ""During the fourth quarters of fiscal year 2024 and 2023, approximately 8,000 and 75,000 40-pound carton equivalents were sold at an average price of $42.63 and $32.64, respectively."",

  ""Now, I'd like to turn the call back to Harold to discuss our fiscal year 2025 outlook and longer-term growth pipeline.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions, and congratulations on a really good year here."",
  ""First, I have a couple of questions around the water monetization efforts."",
  ""First of all, you characterized the events that you anticipate coming in fiscal 2025 as being meaningful?"",
  ""And I'm wondering, relative to the fallowing events, which were certainly appropriate and accretive, would you characterize those fallowing events to have been meaningful as well?"",
  ""I'm just trying to get kind of a relative scale of what we can expect here in fiscal 2025."",
  ""And, Harold, could you remind us what the relative value of Right."",
  ""We'll have to stay tuned for more information there."",
  ""And then, kind of a big picture question on this dynamic is, is the – I'm wondering kind of the status of the regulatory environment as it pertains to these water assets."",
  ""I mean, are there any barriers in place today or events coming soon that you think may be a catalyst for a monetization effort either via the Colorado River Compact or some other regulatory agency or state or local?"",
  ""Anything like that that we should have our ears open to?"",
  ""A lot going on here."",
  ""We'll stay tuned for more news there."",
  ""One question for me on the agribusiness front, and then I'll get back in queue, is around the fresh lemon targets here for 2025."",
  ""So, you're targeting 5 million to 5.5 million cartons, which is nice 10% or so step-up from where you were this year."",
  ""But I think those on lower utilization."",
  ""So, can you talk about what is embedded in that 5 million to 5.5 million in terms of the – an improvement in the utilization rate, more volume coming in from third-party growers, any other big drivers here to get to that that 5 million to 5.5 million carton figure?"",
  ""Well, I appreciate you guys taking my questions."",
  ""That does it for me."",
  ""I'll get back in queue."",
  ""Herald, Mark,  for taking my call."",
  ""Ben asked a couple of my questions, which was great, but I wanted to touch on avocados, right?"",
  ""So, obviously, the underlying theme here is shift from less lemons, more avocados."",
  ""And you highlighted, I think, 1,000 additional acres."",
  ""Could you give us a little bit more details – I know that this is going to be a multi-year process, but how those avocados come into play?"",
  ""And maybe if you're in a position to do so, sort of the economics behind that shift?"",
  ""And just – a lot of numbers there."",
  ""This year, 2025, not much change in avocado pounds, one, because what Harold talked about the rain, but the non-bearing acres should start to come into play a little bit in 2026, more in 2027 and more in 2028."",
  ""And 30 million pounds, got it."",
  ""And I mean, but it was – did you say $15,000 an acre for avocados?"",
  ""How does that compare to lemons?"",
  ""Shifting gears, real estate, JV, I think the last distribution was in June of this past year."",
  ""One, do you know when the next distribution will be?"",
  ""I mean, is it generally speaking, June the timeframe to look at it?"",
  ""And two, I know you said there's $30-some-odd-million in there, no debt, but is – what about the CapEx side or inflows/outflows on that number?"",
  ""I know it's going to grow over time, but I just curious as to... Is that the Harold Edwards Bridge?"",
  ""Is that the Harold Edwards Bridge?"",
  ""I'll jump back in line."",
  ""Yeah,  for taking my follow-up."",
  ""Mark, you were talking about the avocado yield per acre, and I had a follow-up on this."",
  ""So, your rough math is that this year, in a down year, in the alternating cycle, that your 800 acres is going to yield something like 9,000 pounds an acre."",
  ""And you said that over the next few years that you think that 15,000 even in on the downside is going to be possible via how you guys are constructing the Got it."",
  ""Well, congratulations to the Avocado Congress and hurray for Agtech."",
  ""So, it's great to hear all that."",
  "" for taking my follow-up again."",
  ""So, first of all, good to talk to you, Ben."",
  ""So, we believe that the fallowing program for the Colorado River will be extended for another 25 years with new terms defined in 2025, but enacted in 2026."",
  ""So, the new water monetization from the Colorado River water rights won't take place in 2025."",
  ""We do expect there will be meaningful water monetization from the Santa Paula Water Basin, and meaningful from the standpoint that as we have continued to create and accumulate surplus water shares in that basin, we'll be able to demonstrate some of our first transactions in that basin at meaningful values that will, I think, help us better point to the definition of the significant value that exists in those Santa Paula Basin pumping rights."",
  ""So, the fallowing program right now in – on the Colorado River allows us to fallow half of our productive land there."",
  ""So, right now, we have 600 acres that are fallowed."",
  ""The Bureau of Reclamation grants us 5.5 acre feet of water to fallow per acre that we've fallowed."",
  ""And we get paid $400 an acre foot, which generates about $1.3 million of value for us and for not taking that water there."",
  ""So, that's really the economics of those interests."",
  ""In the Santa Paula Basin, as we've accumulated surplus water rights in that basin, we're finding the opportunity to begin to monetize some of those rights for urban needs surrounding us."",
  ""And when we announce the transaction, we will be able to announce the terms of those sales."",
  ""But they are significant and actually significantly more valuable than the Colorado River water rights."",
  ""Well, I think the Department of Interior and their management arm of the Bureau of Reclamation have mandated that one-third of the consumptive of use be cut off the Colorado River."",
  ""And as you've probably been reading, the numerous states that derive benefit from the Colorado River have been sort of – fighting is not the right word, but negotiating on who's going to cut what."",
  ""We believe that one of the biggest needs of actual water for urban development and urban needs exists in Arizona because of the Central Arizona project, which is all the housing from Scottsdale in Phoenix, all the way down to Tucson, but also Lake Mead, which is a primary feeder of Las Vegas and its water."",
  ""We believe that that water will be necessary to divert from agricultural uses at some level anyways into meeting the urban demands and needs."",
  ""And so, therefore, we believe that our Class 3 Colorado River rights will be in perfect position to take advantage of those fallowing programs."",
  ""And that new 25-year accord needs to be set and begun on the river beginning in 2026."",
  ""So, we believe that, as administrations change right now, there will be a big focus on putting that next 25-year accord onto the Colorado River."",
  ""And I would keep our eye, to your question, on those negotiations and the deal that's actually cut on the river, that's going to add up to a third of the consumptive use being cut."",
  ""So, let me take a stab, and then Mark can fill in the rest."",
  ""So, if you look back at our tremendous results of over 15 million pounds produced and sold in fiscal year 2024, we did that on 800 acres that were bearing."",
  ""But as of right now, we have a little over 1,300 acres planted."",
  ""And so, what you'll see is over the course of the next two to three years, the balance of another 700 acres being planted, a part of that comes from being able to get the nursery stock and enough trees to actually accomplish that."",
  ""The great news is that we've got them, we've got them on order."",
  ""So, that's less of a concern."",
  ""As it relates to the economics now, you're going to see, even though we mentioned the alternate bearing nature of production, we've just guided from 7 million to 8 million pounds in fiscal year 2025."",
  ""We've done that trying to be conservative."",
  ""Part of what drives a crop is not only the number of pieces, but also how much size you can get, which is – the bigger the fruit, the heavier the amount of pounds that you get to sell."",
  ""A lot of that is driven by rainfall."",
  ""And we're sitting here towards the end of December have not had a lot of rain so far."",
  ""It's too early to say whether that sizing will actually take place or not."",
  ""But we've tried to guide being conservative that we wouldn't necessarily get the growth in the pieces that are hanging on the tree that we got last year."",
  ""If we do, then you'll see considerably more avocado volume achieved."",
  ""But we're, again, trying to be conservative as we make that guidance."",
  ""As we look forward, we expect that next year should be – or 2026 would be a bigger crop year on the existing acres, but also seeing some of the non-bearing acres that have been planted beginning to produce fruit."",
  ""And as we look forward – and I'll turn it over to Mark, maybe he can give us a look at what he would expect the volume to be."",
  ""But before I do that, we've also in our forecast, just so you know, we've used an average price per pound in our models of $1.30 a pound."",
  ""There are tailwinds that are going with us at this point that could allow us to achieve significantly greater pricing than that."",
  ""But again, in an attempt to be conservative, we used $1.30."",
  ""So if you're building a model, that's kind of where you see our forecast."",
  ""But I'll turn it over to Mark and he can make his comments."",
  ""Yes, I'll let me just take a swing at that, Gerry."",
  ""So, the one thing that happened is when we made our distributions, we actually terminated the revolving line of credit that the partnership had, because we're now in position to self-fund our working capital and our CapEx."",
  ""And so, we do have some CapEx item."",
  ""The next big one is we're about to build a bridge across Santa Paula Creek."",
  ""And so, that's scheduled to break ground and begin construction this spring."",
  ""I think that's the Mark Palamountain Bridge."",
  ""So, yeah, that – and that's actually a really great part of the project because that's actually going to create a lot more better access for people in town to get out to the Harvest project."",
  ""And so, that's actually going to be a really beneficial part of our project."",
  ""But there will be some capital expenditure that's required from that."",
  ""And then we still have the final part of the infrastructure for Phase 3 to go as well."",
  ""So, there is a little bit more CapEx requirements, but there's also community fund districts and the issuance of bond benefits that will come that will help balance that."",
  ""The answer to your question is when the next distribution will be, we're not sure at this point."",
  ""So, we're keeping our share in the partnership at this point."",
  ""And, Ben, just for statistics, the old plantings had approximately 90 trees planted per acre."",
  ""All of our new plantings are high density with over 180 trees per acre."",
  ""So, you can see the significant increase there."",
  ""And also, just as Mark was mentioning, in the way that we're farming them, our internal models are sort of averaging at 17,000 pounds an acre on the new plantings, on the new acreage."",
  ""And as he said, there'll be years that are lower, there'll be years that are higher."",
  ""But our team really feels pretty confident that the new planting should drive that 17,000 pounds per acre as we retool the operation."",
  "" all for your questions and your interest in Limoneira."",
  ""Happy holidays to all of you."",
  ""So, a couple of things."",
  ""So as we finish this year, we had all of Mother Nature's normal challenges that we – from We're gaining most of our volume through recruiting."",
  ""We've recruited about over 0.5 million cartons so far this year."",
  ""And as you know, we have our pivot from lemons into avocados and are planting 1,000 acres of avocados."",
  ""So, some of our lemons will be coming out over time."",
  ""But the goal is still to get somewhere between 20% and 25% of our own fruit owned."",
  ""And then, the balance of those 5 million to 5.5 million cartons will be outside growers."",
  ""So, if we think about the cadence, so we're two years into the, call it, four to five year replanting process."",
  ""So, as Harold mentioned, we're almost 1,400 acres in the ground, of which 750 acres are bearing at this point."",
  ""And that replanting started about two years ago."",
  ""So, we think anywhere from three to four years is when you first start getting your real commercial fruit."",
  ""And then, six to seven years is full bearing."",
  ""You look at some of the trees we've planted right now and some of our neighbor growers have even commented on how well they've grown already."",
  ""We've got them a little bit bigger out of the nursery, it seems."",
  ""And so, we're really anticipating sooner than four years of seeing our first crop."",
  ""And so, if we look at what we've done compared to historical plantings, we're planting higher density trees, different, more robust rootstocks, and also implementing technology to be able to best feed and water our trees when they need it, not just when we have the ability to serve."",
  ""And so, all of those contributing factors are going to are going to take our average pounds per acre, where historically we were anywhere from 7,000 to 15,000 pounds an acre."",
  ""Now, we think we'll produce between 15,000 and 20,000 pounds an acre between the on and off year."",
  ""So, quite a significant increase in production."",
  ""And if you do the math, it costs us about $5,000 an acre currently to farm it."",
  ""And at $20,000 (sic) [20,000 pounds] (00:33:48) an acre at $1.30, you're making over $20,000 per acre back to the farm."",
  ""So, quite different than where lemons are today at anywhere from $2,000 to $5,000, just depending on where the location is."",
  ""So, that's why we're really confident and this year validated that strategy change."",
  ""So, you could kind of go equally, so on our way to 30 million pounds is the target goal."",
  ""As an average, we – at once we have 2,000 acres in, you'll see some years that have 40 million pounds and you'll see some years that have 25 million pounds."",
  ""And so, we think 30 million pounds by 2029 is a good number to have as sort of your baseline average, and then, assume price from there."",
  ""It's $5,000 for us to farm it."",
  ""And it's $15,000 to $20,000 of operating profit per acre, when we get to those levels."",
  ""So, if you go back to the 2018 days, we got up to about $10,000 per acre with a lot more noise and effort."",
  ""Avocados, just depending on – we have Mexico who's the 10,000 pound grower down there that they produce about 90% of what the US consumes."",
  ""As we see comments on tariffs, deforestation and potential other cartel type issues, the US and California avocado, which is where all avocados – or most avocados are produced in the US, has a distinct market advantage, because 70% of avocados are consumed west of the Rockies, and primarily a lot of the Latin influence."",
  ""And so, I think we feel really comfortable with pricing at $1.30 to be conservative."",
  ""You saw Mission Produce come out with their earnings last week that they see pricing to be up 20% year-over-year."",
  ""So, all things point up for avocados at this point."",
  ""So, you did hear right."",
  ""We have been obviously in replanting mode with a lot more trees per acre, almost potentially double in some instances."",
  ""Our young and really intelligent agricultural team has put together the farming practices, pruning that we just never did."",
  ""And I'll go back to say that, since this last year, we started a group internally called the Avocado Congress, which has focused all the stakeholders together from sales to harvest to farming to the executive team, and even external farming board member, to come together – sometimes weekly during the season – to go through how best to take from farm to market the avocados."",
  ""And so, when we have more trees per acre, obviously, that's pretty easy to get from a higher number."",
  ""We had really antiquated irrigation systems for a long time, which were – as we replant these new acreages going forward, we're going to have pressurize lines, where before it was literally turn it on and turn it off, and you just would have to do two-week cycles, where now we could spoon feed on a weekly basis, give all the nutrients you need."",
  ""And it sounds fundamental, but it actually really, really helps as far as long-term productivity for a tree."",
  ""And we're also doing things like drone sprays now, which they're much more precise versus helicopters."",
  ""So, it's just multi factor of things."",
  ""But we're – like this year, we saw on 700 acres, over 15 million pounds."",
  ""And so, just that alone and half of those trees are still older legacy trees."",
  ""So, we're really confident in that 15,000 pounds number and getting to over 20,000 pounds per acre in those high years when we have perfect weather conditions.""

  "" for joining us today."",
  ""Our strong execution in the fourth quarter rounded out an exceptional fiscal 2024 where we delivered $1.2 billion in revenue and generated $107.8 million in adjusted EBITDA, demonstrating the strength of our business model and industry-leading position."",
  ""Throughout the year, we effectively leveraged Mission's differentiated global sourcing network to capitalize on favorable market conditions, which culminated in another quarter of solid financial performance."",
  ""The strength of our integrated business was particularly evident this quarter through the collective efforts of our sales, sourcing, and operations teams."",
  ""When others might have seen challenges given the smaller production out of Peru this year which resulted in supply constraints for the industry, we capitalized opportunities to leverage our unique capabilities and global sourcing network."",
  ""Strong consumer demand and retail support of the category coupled with the supply constraint environment helped support elevated pricing dynamics that extended into the fourth quarter."",
  ""Our ability to seamlessly shift between growing regions and maintain consistent supply for our customers translated into robust per unit margins that exceeded our targeted range."",
  ""This performance underscores the breadth of our sourcing network, which we believe is the most comprehensive in the industry, enabling us to provide reliable supply to our customers even during periods of disruption to key industry supply sources while at the same time maximizing our margin performance."",
  ""We are particularly pleased with our cash flow generation for the full year fiscal 2024 in which we delivered a $64.2 million increase in operating cash flow versus 2023."",
  ""Our strong operational performance throughout the year combined with the planned tapering of our heavy CapEx cycle over the past several years has resulted in strong free cash flow that has strengthened our capital structure through reduced leverage, further enhancing our flexibility."",
  ""While some capital projects, including our packinghouse construction in Guatemala and certain blueberry investments, will shift into early fiscal 2025 due to timing of vendor payments and blueberry plant development, our overall trajectory of moderating capital spending remains intact as we complete these remaining projects and focus on optimizing returns from our existing asset base."",
  ""While our Marketing & Distribution segment performance was the highlight of the quarter, our International Farming segment faced a more challenging set of circumstances related to the El Niño weather cycle and its associated impact on our owned volume."",
  ""We've taken proactive steps to ensure the long-term health and productivity of our orchards and are encouraged by early signs of improvement we are seeing."",
  ""Combined with the cost optimization efforts we implemented, we expect to translate these into improved operational efficiencies as growing conditions normalize in fiscal 2025."",
  ""Turning now to our Blueberries segment, the harvest season ramped up during the fourth quarter and we benefited from pricing that proved to be more resilient than we expected at the higher levels of volume."",
  ""While pricing has since moderated, we remain committed to growing this segment of our business as we see significant opportunities ahead."",
  ""The blueberry business continues to complement our existing offerings and aligns perfectly with the strategy of delivering high-quality, differentiated products across multiple growing regions."",
  ""We look forward to advancing our planned projects in this category as we move through fiscal 2025 and beyond with the support of our strategic joint venture partner."",
  ""While still in its infancy, I am also pleased to report that our strategic investment in Guatemala continues to progress."",
  ""In November, the USDA approved Guatemalan avocado imports into United States, a significant milestone that validates our expansion strategy in the region."",
  ""Similar to our approach with other source regions, the goal with Guatemala is to fill voids in the calendar to reliably supply customers year-round."",
  ""We look forward to the additional flexibility that the USDA approval affords us, which we expect to further strengthen our competitive position in the years to come."",
  ""Further on the topic of our facility work, we took actions in the fourth quarter to optimize our distribution footprint and enhance our efficiency."",
  ""As part of this effort, we will be winding down our Toronto and Calgary facilities through the first quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""We will be able to maintain the same high level of customer service while eliminating redundant costs in our system."",
  ""This decision reflects the flexibility and efficiency that we built into our North American distribution network over the years."",
  ""In closing, I want to thank our team for their outstanding execution throughout fiscal 2024."",
  ""Their hard work and dedication enabled us to successfully navigate dynamic market conditions while driving meaningful growth and operational improvements."",
  ""As we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we're confident in our competitive positioning."",
  ""Our global sourcing network continues to be a key differentiator, providing us with the flexibility to meet customer demand regardless of regional supply dynamics."",
  ""Combined with our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we believe we're well-positioned to continue creating value for our shareholders."",
  ""With that, I'll pass the call over to our CFO, Bryan Giles, for his financial commentary."",
  ""Today's presentation will be hosted by Steve Barnard, Chief Executive Officer; and Bryan Giles, Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""The company's President and Chief Operating Officer, John Pawlowski, is also on today's call for participation during the Q&A session."",
  ""The comments during today's call and the accompanying presentation contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""All statements other than statements of historical facts are considered forward-looking statements."",
  ""These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs as well as a number of assumptions concerning future events."",
  ""Such forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements."",
  ""Some of these risks and uncertainties are identified and discussed in the company's filings with the SEC."",
  ""We'll also refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures today."",
  ""Please refer to the tables included in the , which can be found on our Investor Relations website, investors.missionproduce.com, reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP measures."",
  ""And with that, I'd now like to turn the call over to Steve Barnard, CEO."",
  ""I'll start with a review of our fiscal fourth quarter financial performance, touching on some of the key drivers within our three reportable segments."",
  ""Then I'll provide an update on our financial position and conclude with some thoughts on the current market conditions that we are seeing."",
  ""Total revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 increased 37% to $354.4 million, driven primarily by a 36% increase in avocado sales prices."",
  ""Higher prices resulted from constrained avocado supply during the quarter, driven by weather impacts on fruit development and production in Peru combined with stronger consumer demand."",
  ""Despite lower Peruvian volumes, we were able to leverage our diverse sourcing network across California, Colombia, and Mexico to drive a 9% increase in North American avocado sales volumes compared to the prior year."",
  ""Amidst the supply challenges we faced, we made a strategic decision to prioritize the North American market where strong consumer demand supported by retail promotional activity translated to higher per unit price points."",
  ""Gross profit increased by $28 million to $55.8 million in the fourth quarter, and gross profit margin increased 490 basis points to 15.7% of revenue."",
  ""These increases were primarily driven by stronger per unit margins on avocados sold during the period."",
  ""We can further attribute these increases to the combination of favorable mix of sourced fruit and internal initiatives that Steve spoke to earlier."",
  ""Our Blueberries segment also contributed to the increase with higher volumes while per unit margins remain generally consistent with the prior year."",
  ""SG&A expense increased $6.6 million or 32% compared to the same period last year primarily due to higher employee-related costs, including performance-based incentive compensation and stock-based compensation expense as a result of our improved operating performance relative to the prior year period."",
  ""Adjusted net income for the quarter was $19.6 million or $0.28 per diluted share compared to an adjusted net income of $7.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share last year."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA increased $19.6 million or 113% to $36.9 million as compared to $17.3 million last year."",
  ""This improvement was driven primarily by the stronger gross profit performance from our Marketing & Distribution and Blueberries segments."",
  ""Turning now to our segments, our Marketing & Distribution segment net sales increased 35% to $319.6 million for the quarter, primarily driven by the avocado pricing increases I described previously."",
  ""Segment-adjusted EBITDA increased $14.8 million to $25.6 million as a result of the higher per unit gross margins we discussed."",
  ""Total segment sales and adjusted EBITDA in our International Farming segment were $30.3 million and $2.7 million, respectively, compared to $40.3 million and $1.1 million in the same period last year."",
  ""While we experienced a decrease in segment sales due to the previously disclosed reduction in volume from our own farms as a result of the unfavorable El Niño weather conditions during the harvest set in Peru, we were pleased to generate positive adjusted EBITDA that was higher than the prior year period."",
  ""The improved profitability correlated to the strong pricing environment within which we worked diligently to maximize sales returns with our US market focus and the cost containment efforts we implemented near the end of the prior harvest season."",
  ""In our Blueberries segment, activity is typically concentrated in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year in alignment with the Peruvian blueberry harvest season."",
  ""Net sales in the Blueberries segment totaled $31.6 million compared to $19.5 million in the prior year period."",
  ""And adjusted EBITDA increased to $8.6 million from $5.4 million in the prior year period."",
  ""The increases in both sales and adjusted EBITDA were driven by higher blueberry volumes sold during the quarter that resulted from both new plantings coming into production as well as yield improvements on existing plantings following the challenging weather conditions experienced in the prior year."",
  ""Shifting to our financial position, cash and cash equivalents were $58 million as of October 31, 2024 compared to $42.9 million at October 31, 2023."",
  ""We are very pleased with our operating cash flow performance in fiscal 2024, which increased $64.2 million versus the prior year to $93.4 million for the fiscal year ended October 31."",
  ""The growth in operating cash flow was primarily driven by improved operating performance during fiscal 2024."",
  ""Further supporting the improvement in operating cash flow was favorable working capital management."",
  ""While higher avocado pricing drove increases in inventory and accounts receivable, these increases were more than offset by higher grower payable balances driven primarily by those same high prices and higher accounts payable and accrued expenses, the latter of which was significantly impacted by incentive compensation and statutory profit sharing accruals in the current year."",
  ""In addition, higher accounts payable and accrued expenses were attributed to the impact of higher volume and increased acreage within our Blueberries segment."",
  ""Capital expenditures were $32.2 million for the 12 months ended October 31, 2024 compared to $49.8 million last year and were attributed to avocado and blueberry farming-related investments in Latin America as well as construction costs associated with expanding capacity at our UK distribution facility."",
  ""During the fiscal year, the International Farming segment also began construction of a packhouse in Guatemala."",
  ""Of note, our CapEx spending in fiscal 2024 was approximately $10 million less than we've contemplated in our outlook due to timing of vendor payments and blueberry plant development that will push this spending into fiscal 2025."",
  ""As a result of this timing shift, our projected CapEx budget for fiscal 2025 is expected in the range of $50 million to $55 million, allocated largely to the International Farming and Blueberries segments."",
  ""However, our overall trajectory of moderating capital spending remains intact as we complete these remaining projects through fiscal 2026 and focus on optimizing returns from our existing asset base."",
  ""To that end, we remain committed to driving free cash flow as a means toward maintaining a healthy capital structure."",
  ""We are proud to have generated approximately $60 million of free cash flow in fiscal 2024."",
  ""Looking ahead, we believe the business is well-positioned to continue generating meaningful free cash flow in the years ahead."",
  ""Debt paydown remains our near-term priority and we expect to continue to strengthen our balance sheet next year."",
  ""In regards to our near-term outlook on the fundamental drivers of our operations, we are providing some context around our expectations for industry conditions to help inform your modeling assumptions."",
  ""Beginning with avocados, with the conclusion of the California and Peru harvest seasons, we have transitioned to a Mexico-centric source model."",
  ""We expect industry volumes in our fiscal 2025 first quarter to be consistent with the prior year period."",
  ""While supply from Mexico has been constrained during the early part of the quarter due to fruit maturity and sizing, we expect industry volumes to ramp up when we move to the latter portion of the quarter as we expect a larger Mexican harvest season."",
  ""Pricing is expected to be higher on a year-over-year basis by approximately 20% compared to the $1.40 per pound average experienced in the first quarter fiscal 2024, indicative of continued strength and demand."",
  ""Pricing assumptions are closely tied to the volume estimates previously mentioned."",
  ""As the industry transitions to Mexico being the primary country of origin for supply and supply becomes more readily available, we are expecting that per unit margins on purchased avocados will revert to our historical targeted ranges from the elevated levels that we experienced during our fiscal 2024 third and fourth quarters."",
  ""Our blueberry harvest season in Peru will peak during the first quarter."",
  ""We expect to see meaningful volume increases from owned farms resulting from yield improvements and new acreage in production."",
  ""But the impact on revenue is expected to be offset by lower average sales prices due to higher overall industry volumes from Peru."",
  ""Pricing is expected to be approximately 30% lower on a year-over-year basis, which will negatively impact segment-adjusted EBITDA during the quarter as compared to the previous year when weather-related supply constraints led to abnormally high sales prices."",
  ""In closing, we're incredibly proud of the progress we've made this year."",
  ""We've demonstrated our industry leadership in a turbulent environment while delivering some of the strongest financial performances in our history as a public company, further underscored by robust free cash flow generation."",
  ""These achievements have laid a very strong foundation for Mission's future and we're excited to continue executing on our growth strategy."",
  ""That concludes our prepared remarks."",
  ""Operator, now over to you."",
  ""Please open the call to Q&A.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions and congratulations."",
  ""Great end to a great year here."",
  ""My first question is the results in the quarter relative to the pre-released information."",
  ""Both revenue and EBITDA comfortably exceeded what you had laid out on pre-release five or six weeks ago."",
  ""I'm just wondering kind of what the delta was in the actual results versus what you saw in the pre-release."",
  ""A couple others for me."",
  ""So, first of all, Steve, you noted winding down a couple of facilities here in this current fiscal quarter."",
  ""I'm wondering if you can comment at all on any costs associated with this, both cash or non-cash costs."",
  ""Yeah, that definitely makes sense."",
  ""Both of your comments on the International Farming segment seemed pretty encouraging."",
  ""I'm wondering if you can just kind of big picture talk about especially the EBITDA expectations coming out of that segment here, if you anticipate kind of the directional improvement that you saw in 2024 to continue in 2025 given kind of stabilizing weather conditions and the operational efficiency that you guys have made down there."",
  ""Very good and... Very good."",
  ""Well, fingers crossed up here."",
  ""So, one more for me and then I'll get back in queue."",
  ""Just kind of a big picture macro question."",
  ""Given how much you are involved in the import/export world, how you're thinking about kind of the future of agricultural exports into the US, particularly from Mexico, in the context of potential tariffs."",
  ""Is this a dynamic that's changing at all how you think about operating your supply chain or are you really just kind of sitting back and waiting to see kind of how it all shakes out?"",
  ""Well, I appreciate that context from you both."",
  ""Congratulations again on a really great quarter, really great year, and I'll get back in queue."",
  "" for taking my call."",
  ""Just to follow-up on Ben's question and then the answer, but it seems like consumers have, maybe for lack of a better phrase, busted through the price barrier and seem more consistent at higher prices than maybe a couple years ago."",
  ""Is that fair to say, especially with this past year's results?"",
  ""Does this mean moving forward that retail can keep prices elevated, make more money and maybe help?"",
  ""Does that sort of trickle through to the Missions of the world?"",
  ""Yeah, yeah, I got it."",
  ""It feels like prices or elasticity's coming back or something like that, though."",
  ""Switching gears to blueberries, I mean, blueberries are great."",
  ""But you also noted, I think, increased plantings."",
  ""How many more acres this year than last year and two years ago?"",
  ""And then what is the plan for the blueberries for the next couple years going forward?"",
  ""And then obviously, balance sheet is in good shape."",
  ""You kind of touched on cash flow, but next couple years, good cash flow."",
  ""I mean, debt would be in a very excellent spot."",
  ""I mean, any thoughts on what's after that?"",
  ""Do we go back into maybe increasing some plantings to a degree?"",
  ""Or just curious from that perspective."",
  ""Well, congratulations on a great year."",
  ""Well, those two facilities I mentioned, were not running at a profit and there's ways to provide the same service level that we were providing with a lot less cost by just going direct from other facilities either at the border or somewhere throughout United States into Canada."",
  ""So, we put those in there several years ago for a specific customer and they started buying more and more direct."",
  ""A lot of it from us."",
  ""I mean, we didn't lose the customer, but they were wanting to go direct from the border, not have it ripe and they were going to ripen it themselves."",
  ""So, it kind of outgrew its purpose."",
  ""I'll refer to Bryan on the numbers."",
  ""Yeah, we've gone through – we've gone through an El Niño series a year or two ago, which kind of damaged those trees for a year or so."",
  ""And the crop suffered size-wise, quality-wise."",
  ""We've outgrown that and I think we're on the – that happens about every 10 years so hopefully won't see it for another 10 years."",
  ""Well, I think on Trump's behalf, I think that's a ploy to get them to the table to negotiate help with the immigrant problem."",
  ""Whether he pulls a trigger on the tariff or not, I don't know."",
  ""I hope not, but obviously it will raise costs, probably slow consumption down a little bit."",
  ""I mean, consumption keeps growing and if you look at the overall category, volume goes up and pricing has gone up."",
  ""So, even if it leveled off, we'd be in pretty good shape."",
  ""So, I'm not too worried about it really."",
  ""I think that's directly focused at Mexico, too, not because – I don't think he's going to put a tariff on Peru or Colombia or Guatemala, I hope."",
  ""They're pretty high to start with."",
  ""So, in production you talking about or planting?"",
  ""And another 200 hectares developed, I mean, in process."",
  ""So... Our project's 1,000 hectares."",
  "" for your interest in Mission Produce and we look forward to talking to you again."",
  ""We certainly wanted to get out in front of it."",
  ""We knew that some of the data that was out on the Street was well below where we expected the quarter to track to."",
  ""We certainly didn't have all of our information closed out at the point in time when we put this release together."",
  ""I would say we were bullish on our Marketing & Distribution segment and where pricing and per unit margins were even though we did not yet have everything finalized."",
  ""And that is certainly why we kind of set a floor."",
  ""And we knew that there was some room to be a little bit better than those figures."",
  ""I think the biggest delta that we saw, though, was really in our Farming and Blueberries segments."",
  ""We really had not pulled the closing information together from either of those areas yet."",
  ""It does take us a little bit longer to extract that data from our systems."",
  ""So, I'd say the biggest delta where the volume sold through on blueberries not harvested but actually sold through were a little higher than we expected."",
  ""And the average selling prices that we realized held up better than we'd originally thought they would."",
  ""We knew as we were transitioning towards Q1 that blueberry prices were beginning to decline."",
  ""So, we factored in some conservatism into what we thought pricing was going to look like."",
  ""But in reality, through the end of October, that pricing held up better than we'd expected."",
  ""In terms of the cost, Ben, I would just say that certainly we have some assets there in those facilities that aren't fully amortized or depreciated yet."",
  ""But most of our leases, these leases were due to expire in the next one to two years."",
  ""So, they were close to their end date."",
  ""So, there is a tail on some fixed assets."",
  ""There's a tail on some lease payments that we have left to go."",
  ""Then there's also potentially some asset retirement-related obligations, a minimal amount of severance when all is said and done."",
  ""We had maybe 12 people within those facilities."",
  ""So, they weren't – we're not expecting this to have a significant impact when all said and done, but we do think that longer term it will generate some meaningful cost savings for us."",
  ""To Steve's point, the facilities, there was not enough volume moving through those facilities to enable them to operate efficiently."",
  ""The Canadian market simply has changed over the last decade."",
  ""It's not what it was when we first opened our facilities in Toronto back in the first 2007, 2008 timeframe."",
  ""And certainly, we've had to – it's taken us time to adapt to the changing market conditions out there."",
  ""We think long-term, this is the right choice for us."",
  ""I think at a high level, Ben, things are moving in the right direction."",
  ""I think we did some things in 2024 related to the cost structures within the farms that will continue to pay dividends going forward."",
  ""I think it'll – we expect the market conditions to be different next year than they were in 2024."",
  ""With the weather changes down in Peru, the El Niño effect kind of dissipated in May of this year with – so with weather conditions changing, we're expecting a larger crop as we move into next year, which likely translates and not only from Peru, but in general, we're expecting larger crops across many of the source regions that we work in."",
  ""So, expecting a year of higher volumes and a year where pricing is likely going to come down off the highs we saw this year, particularly as we re-engage to a greater extent with some of the international markets that we work in."",
  ""I'd say in general, we're bullish about the direction of farming."",
  ""If we look back, we've come off a couple of difficult years."",
  ""I mean, 2023, 2024 EBITDA has not been where we would have expected it to be."",
  ""We go back to 2022, our EBITDA was in the $23 million range."",
  ""In 2021, it was north of $30 million."",
  ""We absolutely believe that the Farming segment can move back to those types of levels in the near future as volume picks up and we continue to kind of reopen markets for that fruit."",
  ""I would add to Steve's comments that when you look at the historical capabilities of the team here at Mission, disruptions, price changes, price inflation challenges, getting product from one country to another has always been part of the game."",
  ""And this team has proven and really proven over the last 12 months how well they can execute when things get choppy."",
  ""So, if there's things that come down the path that create some choppiness, this team is absolutely ready for that."",
  ""And then the second piece of it is also what Steve just mentioned, and that's the consumer resilience."",
  ""We have really seen the consumer be resilient through both an inflationary period as well as price."",
  ""Not just the price side, but also from a supply challenge perspective."",
  ""And the consumer is really taking away more and at a higher price than they ever have."",
  ""So, both of those two things combined, I see Mission positioned in a great spot kind of regardless of what happens on the tariff side of things."",
  ""Yeah, we're seeing two macro trends that are driving that."",
  ""The first one, I think you'll hear consistently across anyone in the grocery sector and that is exactly what you just said."",
  ""There's been inflationary pressure over the last 18 months and you're starting to reach points where the consumer has adapted to that."",
  ""The second piece, more specific to our kind of slice of the pie in regards to the produce section is we're seeing a lot of younger consumers enter the marketplace."",
  ""You've got people that are 18 to 30 that are picking up more avocado consumption."",
  ""And those consumers, as they enter the marketplace, they're making up a much bigger portion of our shopper base."",
  ""They are much more resilient than the traditional baby boomers have proven to be in the past."",
  ""I guess the prices – the make more money piece is always the tricky question, right?"",
  ""Because the price versus our cost always plays a role in that."",
  ""I think you'll see more consistency compared to from a margin perspective, from a retail side of things where they were in 2024."",
  ""I mean, Gerry, I think it's all in relative terms where pricing's going to sit."",
  ""There's going to be a supply of volume available and prices need to – it will need ultimately be set at a level that enables the market to consume that supply."",
  ""Do I think at comparable levels, I think the price points will settle in higher than where they were in the past two, three, four years ago."",
  ""But I think as we look to this coming year, if volumes were to increase 10%, 15% across all countries of origin, I would think that that is going to bring pricing down somewhat with that much of a volume increase."",
  ""But again, it'll be a more resilient price than it would have been two, three, four years ago."",
  ""I want to say there were definitely times, I mean, where that $0.99 per piece barrier was kind of an indicator of when demand would start to taper."",
  ""And that doesn't seem to be the threshold or the limit any longer."",
  ""I mean, price points... $1.25, $1.49."",
  ""We're not seeing that having a negative impact on pull-through any longer."",
  ""So, yeah, I think inflation, it's taken a few years, I think, for maybe the consumer to adapt to paying higher prices, but it feels like it's finally kind of come through our category in this last year."",
  ""Blueberries have a pretty quick turn."",
  ""Like usually within a year, they're in a productive state unlike an avocado tree where it can take four or five years."",
  ""But blueberries, I think we rolled out another 100 hectares this year."",
  ""I think we'll be layering in at least another 100 hectares."",
  ""We're doing some double density planting, Gerry, in the first year."",
  ""So, I'm like in my head, I'm 100 hectares this year, but maybe a little more than 100 hectares worth of plants."",
  ""And then we're probably looking at another close to 200 hectares coming into production for the next harvest season, which would roll through Q4 of 2025 and into Q1 of 2026."",
  ""And that would be on top of – I think prior to this, we had about somewhere close to 500 hectares in production."",
  ""So, when all is said and done with our plantings up in the northern almost region, we should roughly double the size of the blueberry plantings that we had in place before we started that project."",
  ""So, overall acreage, certainly a lot of these plantings are of the new, more desirable varieties as well, which we believe over the long-haul are going to help drive higher average selling prices over some of the generic varieties that are being grown in country."",
  ""So, I think we're excited about the opportunity that lies ahead."",
  ""Certainly, focused on trying to stretch harvest season, things of that nature."",
  ""So, we're not overloading markets at certain times of the year and again, getting fruit of those premium varieties with the right sizing and the right quality to generate those above average returns."",
  ""I mean, I think our plan, Gerry, I mean, and we've been communicating for years and for a couple years, I don't think we changed too much on it that our expectation was that we've gone through a couple – had gone through a couple years where our operating cash was depressed."",
  ""I think the year we saw in 2024 was more in line with what we believe the long-term capabilities of this business are."",
  ""Capital has continued to step down, probably stepped down."",
  ""It looks like it stepped down a little more this year than it really did because of some timing things."",
  ""But nonetheless, it's well off of the numbers that we've seen over the last three or four years, and we expect that will continue."",
  ""So, yes, we're going to generate significant cash flow."",
  ""I would think next year, as we look to fiscal 2025, our priority would still be on paying debt down."",
  ""We will be in a position where we'll have our balance sheet in really good shape and that will enable us to evaluate other opportunities with that cash, one of which could be returning cash to shareholders in some way, shape or form.""

  ""Obviously, the first thing I would like to talk about is the impact of the war on the markets and on the Bank."",
  ""From the first day of the war, the Bank is taking a pro client approach, trying to offer immediate relief to its clients beyond the mandatory relief plan of the Bank of Israel while adapting the COVID experience and best practice to the current situation."",
  ""Well, in the first days, we have seen a typical response of the market to the unfolding events, with equities prices going down, yields and bond goes up and the depreciation of the shekel vis-a-vis the US dollar."",
  ""Rating agencies have downgraded and/or put on a negative watch both the government and the Bank."",
  ""In the weeks after, we have seen equity prices going up, bond yields going down, later up again and the dollar shekel rate went back down to even below its pre-war level."",
  ""As for the Bank, you can see from the reports the robustness of the result."",
  ""As you can see, we took what we think is a prudent approach to provisioning given the prolonged duration of the war."",
  ""It is worth noting that most of the provisions are collective."",
  ""And just to put it in the right context, in 2022, our provisions for the entire year were around ILS 0.5 billion and in 2023, our annual provisions were around ILS 1.5 billion."",
  ""And again, for the most part, provisions were collective."",
  ""As for the other items, I would like to use this call to further highlight a couple of points."",
  ""We've seen an increase in most of the major balance sheet items and we think that our credit metrics reflect the balanced credit portfolio with adequate risk management."",
  ""The net profit and the return on equity reflects the strong balance sheet in the CPI figures, the good efficiency ratio and the contribution of Union Bank to our results."",
  ""You can see that financing revenues from current operations are on a positive trend."",
  ""Commissions are, of course, affected from both the war and client-oriented relief approach the Bank has taken."",
  ""Our cost/income ratio for the quarter is well below 40%."",
  ""And I'll remind you that our cost/income ratio target, as published in the strategic plan, is to be below 50% by the end of the plan in 2025."",
  ""On the expense side, you can see the improvements vis-a-vis 2023, reflecting also the post Union Bank merger synergies."",
  ""And as always, salaries are also affected from variable remuneration related to the Bank's results."",
  ""The result also takes into account the relative extra tax Israeli banks are paying in 2024 and 2025."",
  ""Liquidity is very robust with high share of core deposits and the capital ratios are in tandem with profitability."",
  ""Credit growth in the last quarter is healthy both in mortgages and in corporate loan."",
  ""Demand for mortgages is improving and we continue to follow our strategy to retain our market share in the market."",
  ""We think that it is reasonable to assume that today's balance sheet growth will materialize in the coming quarters."",
  ""We do expect to see further responsible credit growth following the strategic plan."",
  ""And as can be seen from our results, we have already reached the main targets of our strategic plan before 2025."",
  ""We will distribute 40% of third quarter profits as dividends according to our dividend policy."",
  ""All in all, I think we are following the strategic plan and accommodating to the new environment."",
  "" very much for your attention."",
  ""And with that, I leave you with the hands of Mr. Mena Aviv, our Chief Accountant."",
  ""The main figures in our financial statements are as follows."",
  ""Net profit in Q3 2024 reached ILS 1,425 million."",
  ""Net profit in the first nine months of 2024 reached ILS 4,149 million."",
  ""Return on equity in Q3 2024 and in the first nine months of 2024 reached 19%."",
  ""The equity amounted ILS 30.4 billion."",
  ""Cost/income ratio reached in Q3 2024, 33.9%."",
  ""Financing revenues from current operation in Q3 reached ILS 2,847 million."",
  ""Our total revenues in Q3 reached ILS 3,797 million."",
  ""Operating and other expenses in Q3 totaled to ILS 1,289 million."",
  ""The ratio of provision for loans in Q3 reached 0.15%."",
  ""The ratio of Q1 reached 10.43% and total ratio reached 13.58%."",
  ""I think we can go to Q&A.""
]","[
  ""And regarding provisions and loans, we've seen some shifts in provisions over the last year from normalized levels and loan growth has been quite resilient despite the lower growth environment due to the war."",
  ""How should we be looking at these two items going forward?"",
  ""I think as you can see, if you compare it to 2023, we're down a notch."",
  ""I would expect to see us coming forward with this new level with reasonable growth there."",
  ""The main reason that we see this improvement is the finalization of all the post-merger activities of the merger with Union Bank and some internal efficiency activities which are natural, not something that is big in this respect."",
  ""So, I would say for the most part, it is because of the better synergies on the cost side we have after we have finished to merger the bank, the Union Bank."",
  ""So, on the growth side, the main two areas that grew this quarter were mortgages and corporate."",
  ""As I'm saying, we saw the improvement in the mortgage market, and we think we should see similar levels."",
  ""So, we're not going back to 2022, but also we have noted the downs of the fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024."",
  ""On the provision, we see that in Q3, we've made a very big Q3."",
  ""I mean last year, 2023, a very big provision due to the war with close to ILS 700 million."",
  ""To the most part, it was collective."",
  ""And we see now we've made ILS 130 million this quarter, 0.15% for the quarter, 0.16% if you look the nine months."",
  ""So, I think this should be a more representative environment than what we saw in Q3 last year, which was very, very big because of the war.""

  ""I'd like to welcome Darren to his first Enerpac ."",
  ""He's been on board as our CFO for nearly two months and is coming up to speed very quickly."",
  ""We're thrilled to have him on the team."",
  ""And now, switching to the quarter and beyond."",
  ""We enter fiscal 2025 mindful of a continued sluggish industrial macro environment as evidenced by persistently weak manufacturing PMI and industrial production trends you can see on slide 3."",
  ""While we saw a decline in the Americas region of our industrial tools and services business due to these challenging market conditions, we were pleased to report sales growth across Enerpac's two other geographic regions and at Cortland Biomedical."",
  ""Overall, we believe Enerpac can continue to outperform the market, given our global brand leadership, targeting growth strategy, customer-driven innovation, and continuous improvement process to enhance operational efficiency, and productivity."",
  ""In light of the global macro situation, we are actively monitoring costs in the short term, to ensure our cost structure aligns with business conditions."",
  ""We also have a detailed strategy that will enable us to continue to enhance profitability on a longer-term basis, which I will speak to in a moment."",
  ""In the meantime, I'll turn the call over to Darren to elaborate on our financial performance in the quarter."",
  ""On a geographic basis, as seen on slide 7, we were encouraged by our performance in the EMEA region, which continued to generate positive year-over-year growth against tough comparisons despite the macro pressures in Germany and France, which are two of our largest economies in the region."",
  ""We enjoyed particular strength in the wind market with a bright outlook given an array of projects in the pipeline."",
  ""Service revenue also remained strong, driven by petrochemical markets and power generation, particularly in nuclear."",
  ""In the Asia Pacific region, we were pleased to see a return to year-over-year growth with a sales gain in the mid-single-digits."",
  ""While Australia continues to be soft mainly due to depressed conditions in the mining industry, the rest of the region is experiencing solid trends."",
  ""For the full year, we continue to anticipate growth in the Asia Pacific region."",
  ""In our largest market, the Americas, the environment remains cautious, which is reflected in our results this quarter."",
  ""While we are seeing gains in Heavy Lifting Technology or HLT and services, sales of our standard industrial tool products were weaker in the quarter, with many customers sticking to a wait-and-see posture."",
  ""With inventories in line, we're cautiously optimistic that clarity on the direction of interest rates and policies from the new administration will create a more positive demand environment in the coming months."",
  ""In the meantime, we are enjoying a favorable market response to our new products, including our line of battery torque wrenches, battery-powered pumps, and hydraulic blowers."",
  ""In addition, we continue to focus on our sales funnel management utilizing Enerpac Commercial Excellence or ECX."",
  ""For the second consecutive quarter, Cortland posted year-over-year revenue growth and remains on track to generate growth for the full year with the benefit of several new products."",
  ""Last quarter, we introduced Powering Enerpac Performance or PEP, our continuous improvement program, which will propel our goal of capturing further profitable growth and margin improvement."",
  ""Overall, we're focused on continued standardization and simplification of processes and ensuring best practices are consistently applied across the organization."",
  ""Let me drill down on some specific opportunities."",
  ""On the gross profit line, we have several levers, including increasing lean conversion and kaizen activity in our facilities, value engineering and ongoing SKU rationalization just to name a few."",
  ""But perhaps our most significant near-term opportunity is on the sourcing side."",
  ""Under our new vice president of sourcing and our strategic sourcing initiative, we are optimizing and rationalizing our supply base."",
  ""At the start of the ASCEND program in 2022, Enerpac was sourcing from more than 6,000 suppliers."",
  ""Through the application of 80/20, we've been able to reduce that to fewer than 5,000 today."",
  ""And our goal is to drive further reductions in the supply base to leverage our buying power and focus our spend with supply partners who can support our needs most effectively and provide the best cost, quality, and delivery."",
  ""On the SG&A expense line, we've already made tremendous progress toward our goal of being best-in-class as a percent of revenue."",
  ""Over the past three fiscal years, we've reduced adjusted SG&A as a percent of sales by approximately 650 basis points."",
  ""For example, we have derived a significant benefit from offshoring of transactional processing and certain finance, IT, and human resource functions."",
  ""But moving labor to lower cost regions is just the start."",
  ""We're now embarking on the next phase, which is to simplify, standardize and ultimately automate key processes."",
  ""And Darren's experience in managing shared service center operations will be a tremendous asset as we add additional functions and optimize the performance of our offshore operations."",
  ""Since we announced a rounding out of Enerpac's leadership, including the recent additions of Darren and Eric Chack, our Executive Vice President of Operations, we have held our Annual Global Leadership Conference."",
  ""This was a great opportunity to conduct a deep review of our growth strategy, evaluate challenges and opportunities, and generate key action plans to pursue in fiscal 2025 and beyond."",
  ""I believe, we have the right people and strategy to succeed in any environment."",
  ""Moreover, we were pleased to see yet another year of improving employee engagement scores, which I believe, is a reflection of our winning culture that has been embraced across the organization."",
  ""With that, we'd be happy to take questions."",
  ""On the call today to present the company's results are: Paul Sternlieb, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Darren Kozik, Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""The slides referenced on today's call are available on the Investor Relations section of the company's website, which you can download and follow along."",
  ""A recording of today's call will also be made available on our website."",
  ""Today's call will reference non-GAAP measures."",
  ""You can find a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures in the press release issued yesterday."",
  ""Our comments will also include forward-looking statements that are subject to business risks that could cause actual results to be materially different."",
  ""Those risks include matters noted in our latest SEC filings."",
  ""Now, I will turn it over to Paul."",
  ""As seen on slide 4, Enerpac's total revenue increased 2.3% in the first quarter of 2025."",
  ""At our IT&S business, revenue increased 2.3% year-over-year with a 1% decline in organic sales."",
  ""The slight decline in organic sales was comprised of a 5.6% increase in service revenue, offset by a 3% decrease in product sales."",
  ""Paul will speak about the regional performance later in the call."",
  ""Results for the first quarter included nearly a full quarter of revenue from DTA, an acquisition we closed on September 4."",
  ""In the quarter, we made solid progress in integration and delivered more than $3 million in revenue and $5 million in order volume."",
  ""We are excited about the combination of DTA with our Heavy Lifting Technology or HLT business and expect growth benefits as we expand DTA sales beyond Europe by leveraging Enerpac's global commercial network."",
  ""Therefore, we are maintaining our expectation of a full-year 2025 sales of €20 million from DTA."",
  ""At Cortland Biomedical, reported in our other segment, we generated another quarter of growth with a year-over-year revenue increase of 2.6%."",
  ""Turning to slide 5, gross profit margin declined 90 basis points year-over-year to 51.4%."",
  ""This was primarily due to lower sales in the Americas, a higher percentage of service revenue and a return to normalized margins at Cortland, which remains accretive to Enerpac's overall performance."",
  ""Adjusted SG&A held flat at 29% of revenue despite the inclusion of DTA, reflecting our ability to manage our cost base."",
  ""We will continue to monitor costs closely in the second quarter, given the environment."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA margins declined 100 basis points in the first quarter of 2025 due to the gross margin discussed and the inclusion of DTA."",
  ""Adjusted earnings per share were $0.40 for the first quarter of 2025 compared with $0.39 in the year ago period, a 3% increase."",
  ""The effective tax rate was nearly flat at 22% compared with 21.9% in the year-ago period."",
  ""Turning to the balance sheet shown on slide 6."",
  ""Enerpac's position remains extremely strong."",
  ""Net debt was $63 million, resulting in net debt leverage of 0.5 times adjusted EBITDA at the end of the first quarter."",
  ""Total liquidity was $529 million."",
  ""In the quarter, free cash flow improved $11 million from the prior-year period as a result of higher net earnings and lower annual incentive compensation payments, which more than offset increased CapEx related to our upcoming headquarter relocation."",
  ""We remain very excited about the move and the benefits it will have for the company."",
  ""As we continue to generate cash, coupled with our current leverage, we have the needed capacity to deploy capital for our disciplined M&A strategy as well as internal investments and continued opportunistic share repurchases."",
  ""With that, let me turn it back to Paul to discuss our commercial performance by region.""

  ""Hey, Paul, I was just wondering, I think when we spoke on the fourth quarter and you called it out today, obviously, the industrial environment is a little bit weaker and continues to be weak."",
  ""I was just wondering, obviously, you guys don't provide quarterly guidance, but did 1Q play out generally – or as you would have expected?"",
  ""Anything, maybe positive that you saw in the quarter besides your pretty strong results?"",
  ""And kind of an offshoot of that, you mentioned a little bit of that, with the change in administration and the talk of tariffs, I think you make a good percentage of products here in the US, but you have any early thoughts on the talk of tariffs with China and Mexico and any potential impact for you guys?"",
  ""Maybe one or two more – kind of shifting gears a little bit on the geographic front."",
  ""Happy to see that the upper low-single-digits on the EMEA, I was just wondering – I mean, we continue to hear about challenging business environment, especially in Germany."",
  ""I think you called it out as one of your larger segments."",
  ""Is – any other color – you seem to be kind of outperforming the market there."",
  ""Is there any thoughts on your EMEA performance?"",
  ""Maybe just lastly on the services business, kind of a two-part question."",
  ""You continue to kind of call out or put up good year-over-year organic growth in the services business."",
  ""I guess, one, what do you attribute the – those drivers to; and two, I think you called it out as maybe a drag on overall margins."",
  ""I apologize if I got that wrong, but just – is there a pathway to get that to more of a company-wide or a product margin?"",
  ""Just any thoughts on that."",
  ""Yeah, I was on mute."",
  ""Forgive me, maybe I missed it, but anything on pricing within the US in the quarter and kind of what you're seeing more globally?"",
  ""Do you guys give intra-year price increases if it's warranted?"",
  ""It seems like there's early chatter about the infrastructure spending in the US picking up."",
  ""A lot of companies are calling for second half project activity, timing dependent."",
  ""So just anything you're hearing from your distributors and maybe expectations on what the lead times look like for restocking if we were to start to see an acceleration in greenfield activity?"",
  ""And just maybe lastly for Darren, two months into the role, but any initial impressions and can you give us a sense of what your priorities are in the coming 6 to 12 months?"",
  ""Well, welcome to the team."",
  ""We look forward to working with you."",
  ""So, great to see the return to growth in APAC this quarter."",
  ""I'm curious whether you could provide some context in terms of what drove that return to growth, given the soft – the continued softness in mining, whether it was just a return to growth among the core products or whether there was some benefit of the implementation of the second brand strategy?"",
  ""And so you guys have a lot of programs going on at the same time, all working towards improving the efficiency of the business, whether it be at PEP or ECX, or the digital transformation strategies."",
  ""A lot of those seems like investing in yourself kind of strategies."",
  ""Can you put any context around where you guys see yourselves within this goal?"",
  ""I know it's probably early stage overall, but just in terms of where you guys are within these initiatives."",
  ""And then one lastly, if I may."",
  ""The integration of the DTA acquisition, just curious as to how that's going in terms of I guess the reception from the marketplace around the combined capabilities now, combining both the vertical and horizontal listing technologies."",
  ""Just curious as to how the messaging is being received in the early days of the integration."",
  "" for all the color and congratulations on the execution in some challenging markets."",
  "" for the question, Tom."",
  ""I think, as we mentioned in our remarks on the call, it played out pretty much as we expected, frankly."",
  ""I mean, we knew it was a tougher comp lapping Q1 of fiscal 2024."",
  ""And obviously, just the environment that we're seeing."",
  ""So we suspected it was going to be a little bit more challenging here, certainly in Q1."",
  ""Our expectations are, at this point, built into our guidance essentially for the rest of the year for better topline performance."",
  ""And I think we're optimistic, just given the things that we referenced in the call around some of the potential new policies and new administration and also, just frankly what we hear in terms of latest, I'll call it, voice of customer research from our customers and our channel partners even over the last week or two."",
  ""There's, I'd say, a fair amount of optimism."",
  ""I mean, certainly that has to ultimately translate into demand and orders."",
  ""But I think people are relatively hopeful about what to expect in calendar 2025."",
  ""So – but yeah, really, Q1 played out essentially as expected for us."",
  ""We do make – we are a global manufacturer, but our largest facility is here in the US actually in Wisconsin."",
  ""So I think, generally speaking, I'd say Enerpac is probably in a relatively favorable position when it comes to the impact of or potential impact of any new tariffs."",
  ""Just for reference, imports from Canada and Mexico into the US for us are negligible."",
  ""And then from a China perspective, on a direct basis, I would estimate that our products and components imported from China into the US represents less than $20 million of value."",
  ""So, certainly not zero but something we're able to deal with effectively, something we did deal with in the first Trump administration years ago."",
  ""I think we've got a good playbook to work with that from a cost perspective, from a dual sourcing perspective, and also certainly price if that's needed."",
  ""So it's not nothing, but I wouldn't say it's hugely impactful given that dollar value for us."",
  ""I mean, we do continue to be pleased."",
  ""We had good performance in Q4 at EMEA and even here in Q1, relatively strong performance certainly versus the Americas."",
  ""And I think the market conditions have been more challenging more recently."",
  ""I mean, we can see that in the macro data as we referenced, particularly in Germany and France."",
  ""But I think we are – we believe with a good degree of confidence, we are continuing to gain share there just based on the execution of our commercial strategies, our growth strategies in the region, some of the key leadership and people changes we've made, which are having great effect there; some of the process changes, again, we've made commercially; and I think some of the success, frankly, that we're seeing with our new product rollout in the regions."",
  ""So we're pleased, again, with the progress that we're seeing in EMEA even, I would say, in a tougher macro environment."",
  ""So, yeah, I think, we have seen certainly services here in the short term outperforming from a growth perspective and probably not hugely surprising."",
  ""I mean, service revenue can outpace product, because it is in service more or tied, I would say, to regularly scheduled maintenance as opposed to kind of some of our product business that can be more linked to project work or sometimes CapEx investments."",
  ""So, I think the service business does tend to be a bit more steady and helps offset some of the weaknesses we see from time-to-time in the product business."",
  ""Over the longer term, however, I'd say, we'd expect to see product growth outpace service, just as we continue to execute on our , Tom."",
  ""So as a general rule of thumb, I mean, we're always evaluating our price positioning."",
  ""As you know, we tend to be a premium or the premium player in our space for most of where we're positioned."",
  ""And generally speaking, we would look to take price increases either one to two times a year to at least recover And we are still, I remind folks, in an inflationary environment, as we can see in the data."",
  ""And, in fact, we actually just announced a round of price increases in both the Americas and our EMEA region that will be effective at the beginning of January."",
  ""It's very low single digits, but that's pretty typical in the norm for us."",
  ""And certainly, we monitor what's happening in the marketplace."",
  ""I'd say generally what we see is a behaved observer is – behavioral kind of aspect of the market is that we typically see competitors follow within a period of time and we'll continue to monitor that."",
  ""But we typically tend to be the price leader in our space."",
  ""I mean, we certainly have in the past where we've seen more inflationary environment taken more than one price increase."",
  ""And we certainly would look at that if warranted."",
  ""Clearly, if tariffs or incremental tariffs do come into play, if we don't feel that we can effectively mitigate those appropriately through other actions, we certainly would evaluate other pricing actions as we go into 2025."",
  ""I mean, I think we subscribe to some proprietary databases."",
  ""They give us sort of pretty good indication of kind of what's coming down the pipe and that is favorable."",
  ""I mean, we certainly see a fair amount of activity picking up."",
  ""I'd say it hasn't necessarily materialized for us in meaningful ways yet."",
  ""As you know, Enerpac really participates kind of on the backend of the lifecycle once materials show up at the job site and they really need to start putting the pieces together."",
  ""But the indications we do see are projects being vetted out and kind of the design and civil engineering work underway, etcetera."",
  ""Some of the early sort of indications are procurement processes."",
  ""So I think that does bode well and we think will be favorable."",
  ""We do continue to believe that will be a nice tailwind for Enerpac over the next several years."",
  ""Again, we haven't seen that materialize so much yet here in the US although I'd say we have seen actually relatively decent infrastructure projects outside of the US, including in Europe and parts Asia-Pac."",
  ""So, that's what we've seen today."",
  ""From a lead time perspective, I think we're well-positioned."",
  ""We're pretty competitive there overall."",
  ""Certainly for our kind of standard product high runners, we do typically maintain finished goods here at Enerpac as well as in our channel."",
  ""We think those are largely appropriate levels."",
  ""But we monitor that closely, and I think we – given the lead times on these projects, I mean, you get pretty good runway and indications."",
  ""And I think we wouldn't have an issue being able to address any of that at this point in time."",
  ""I think, it actually was all of the above, Steve."",
  ""I mean, certainly the more challenging areas we referenced is Australia and that market is still soft, just due to the mining sector."",
  ""But beyond that, it was pretty broad based in Asia-Pac."",
  ""Most of the other countries where we operate with scale, we saw good, good growth year-over-year."",
  ""It was in both our core product and we saw some good performance on our HLT business as well."",
  ""So overall, I think, it was pretty broad based."",
  ""That gives us some increasing confidence as we go into the rest of the fiscal year here."",
  ""Certainly, on the second brand, we continue to execute that."",
  ""We've got, increased commercial focus on our team behind that and we have made some incremental progress, good progress, I think, on adding additional distributors in the region to cover second brand."",
  ""Obviously, that is, definitely a multiyear effort to get the channel partners, the network built up for the second brand and also to continue to drive overall marketing and brand awareness."",
  ""But we feel good about where we are with that to date."",
  ""I mean, it's really evergreen for us, Steve."",
  ""As we talked about, PEP is essentially the continuation of ASCEND."",
  ""And although ASCEND is formally over and we're not suggesting out onetime cost, really the mechanism I call the machine that we built through ASCEND is effective day to day in PEP."",
  ""In fact, we have a transformation office that's staffed, that drives the program day to day for us, all the same tracking of the initiatives, etcetera, same language that we use internally to track these initiatives and categorize them and to make sure they're driving sustainable impact to the P&L. Ultimately, we see this driving more efficiency and productivity and enabling more organic growth in the business."",
  ""Certainly from a margin perspective, through ASCEND effectively we got to our target margin of 25% adjusted EBITDA margin essentially a year ahead of plan end of fiscal 2024."",
  ""But we do see continued opportunity."",
  ""And we did say even this year effectively at the midpoint of our guidance, if you exclude DTA, essentially we built another 50 bps of margin expansion in there."",
  ""And that's kind of our framework under our current kind of multiyear financial guidance going forward."",
  ""So we do continue to see or – and expect to see benefits from the implementation of PEP."",
  ""And we're also extending that, right?"",
  ""I mean, we're extending it in the commercial tools like ECX or Enerpac Commercial Excellence."",
  ""As we previously mentioned, we rolled that out here in the Americas region through fiscal 2024 and we're now in the process of rolling out ECX in the EMEA region in fiscal 2025."",
  ""So that's just again part of our continuous improvement process and ethos here at Enerpac."",
  ""And I would just add, I agree with Darren's points also."",
  ""We have built the commercial growth playbook."",
  ""We rolled that out across our Enerpac commercial network, and they're very clear on how to identify and qualify initial leads for DTA."",
  ""So I'm really encouraged by the progress we've made there, the initial lead generation that's happening through the Enerpac commercial network, which – that was certainly a big part of the premise of our investment thesis behind the acquisition."",
  ""Early days seems to be playing out well."",
  ""Well,  again for joining us this morning."",
  ""Enerpac will be presenting at the upcoming CJS Securities Annual Investor Conference on January 14 and the Gabelli Annual Pump, Valve and Water Symposium on February 27 in New York."",
  ""We hope to see you there."",
  ""And best wishes for a wonderful holiday season and a happy New Year."",
  ""Yeah, it's been a great start."",
  ""Started obviously meeting a significant amount of investors, shareholders as well as extended leadership team in Milwaukee."",
  ""So over the first six weeks, it's been – I've got a great feel especially for the culture of Enerpac."",
  ""As I've been here, kind of a culture of continuous improvement, that mindset embeds itself in the organization."",
  ""And I would say second observation and a big one is the power of the Enerpac brand."",
  ""Seeing that at play in the markets, the pricing we can drive is a fantastic benefit for the company."",
  ""And, finally, it's – as Paul alluded to in his comments, it's just the team we have."",
  ""It's a team we can win with."",
  ""We can win in any market."",
  ""So we're going to operate and we're going to win."",
  ""I'll take both parts of that."",
  ""From an integration perspective, performing well."",
  ""We've got the back office functioning, we're working as a team together."",
  ""And then commercially, that promise holds and now we can move things vertically, we can move things horizontally, taking that business from its roots in Europe."",
  ""We're excited about the future and this year, taking some of our commercial wherewithal, moving that outside of Europe where they've been a big, big player the last couple of years."",
  ""So it is holding to the promise."",
  ""We're holding to the expectation and it's performing very, very well for us."",
  ""Orders were very strong in the quarter, which is a great sign for the future.""

  ""We are proud to report a very strong fiscal 2024 result, which came in ahead of our expectations."",
  ""We are delivering on the commitments we made during our IPO by expanding profitably into the white-space opportunities we identified."",
  ""Underpenetrated product categories such as closed-toe silhouettes, orthopedics, professional, outdoor, and important APMA region and own retail."",
  ""In our first full fiscal year since we completed our IPO in October 2023, we delivered 22% revenue growth in constant currency, extending our decade long track record of 20%-plus compounded annual revenue growth driven by continued growing demand for our products across all segments, channels and categories."",
  ""And we are growing profitably."",
  ""Our 2024 adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, beating the high end of our expectations."",
  ""In fiscal year 2024, revenue from closed-toe silhouettes grew at over twice the rate of the overall group and increased share of business to about one-third."",
  ""In 2024, about half of our Top 20 selling silhouettes were closed-toe."",
  ""Our APMA business grew at 42%, nearly double the pace of the overall business."",
  ""Our own retail revenue grew over 2 times the pace of the overall business as we continued to add to our own stores fleet, opening 20 new doors globally in fiscal 2024."",
  ""Leveraging the investments we made in our new Pasewalk factory, we launched our newest orthopedic innovations."",
  ""The Blue Footbed for sneakers expanded and relaunched our professional line, including the fully certified Birki Air 2.0 and expanded our water-ready outdoor sandals."",
  ""We also made additional investments in As consumers are becoming increasingly selective and more intentional in their spending, we are taking share and gaining the attention of our key retail partners and their shoppers."",
  ""Our D2C business grew 21% and penetration of approximately 40% was consistent with last year."",
  ""We ended the fiscal year with 67 stores globally, up from 47 at the end of fiscal 2023."",
  ""We grew our membership base by over 30% during the year to over 8 million loyal members who shop more frequently and spend on average 30% more than non-members."",
  ""We continue to balance growth between B2B and D2C to meet the growing global demand, achieve our profitability goals and maximize our reach, especially into the new targeted consumer groups."",
  ""Now, let's move to a brief discussion of segment performance for the year."",
  ""Within our largest segment, the Americas, we experienced strong consumer demand for our brand throughout the year."",
  ""Revenue in the region was up 19% compared to fiscal 2023."",
  ""We saw a noticeable return to in-person shopping at multi-brand retailers in the second half of the year."",
  ""As such, our B2B strengthened throughout the year as many of our strategic partners allocated more space to BIRKENSTOCK and experienced very strong back-to-school sell-through."",
  ""We have emerged as a must carry brand within our strategic retailers."",
  ""We believe that significant reach with both store count and social media impressions have amplified our consumer demand beyond what we may achieve on our own."",
  ""In the Americas D2C channel, which is almost entirely digital, we delivered revenue growth in the mid-teens."",
  ""We expanded our physical retail presence, opening four new stores during fiscal 2024."",
  ""We recently opened our first Boston store and plan to add several additional stores later this year."",
  ""In Europe, we delivered exceptional growth of 21%, which was broad-based across all countries and channels."",
  ""In the first full year since the completion of our transformation initiatives in the region, we clearly see the benefits of the improved quality in our distribution with double digit unit and ASP growth."",
  ""While both closed-toe and sandals grew at double digits for the year, closed-toe grew at over 2.5 times faster than sandals, driving ASP higher."",
  ""We have gained shelf space in strategic retail partners and our brand awareness increased an average of 400 basis points in the key markets since we began our transformation in 2022."",
  ""We saw strength in both the D2C and B2B channels in Europe."",
  ""Our focus on better alignment with key strategic retail partners led to increased orders and elevated sell-through performance from these targeted accounts."",
  ""Our partners continued to widen their BIRKENSTOCK assortment to meet the expanding consumer demand."",
  ""In our B2B order book for Autumn-Winter 2024, we doubled share of business in shoes compared to last year."",
  ""Our European D2C business grew at a similar pace as B2B. After several years of retail consolidation in the region, we embarked on our retail expansion strategy in 2024."",
  ""We opened three new stores in the region, including our first store in Paris."",
  ""We have identified several additional locations throughout Europe for additional owned retail stores in 2025."",
  ""The APMA region was our fastest growing segment in fiscal 2024, growing 42%, nearly double the pace of the overall business."",
  ""We continue to make progress toward penetrating this significant whitespace for the BIRKENSTOCK brand."",
  ""Still at only 12% for our overall revenue mix, we see substantial opportunities for growth and will continue to invest in the segment."",
  ""Aligned with our roadmap and commitment to the region, we added 13 new owned retail stores, bringing our total to 25 in the APMA region."",
  ""Additionally, the launch of our online store in the Philippines and the strong performance throughout our digital channel is supporting strong regional DTC growth."",
  ""We also expanded our strategic partnerships, increasing our mono-brand partner doors by approximately 20%, which drives B2B growth in the region."",
  ""Greater China made up mid-teens share of APMA revenue."",
  ""We are still in the early stages of our market rollout there, but are steadily building brand awareness and demand through our increased retail and online presence."",
  ""We opened our first owned store in Chengdu in October and will turn our successful pop-up store in Shanghai into a permanent store later this year."",
  ""I will now turn it over to Erik to discuss our financial results in more detail."",
  ""Our strength in fiscal 2024 and outlook for 2025 demonstrate our ability and commitment to deliver on the promises we made during our IPO."",
  ""We are delivering strong double-digit revenue growth, excellent margins, exceptional cash generation, and expanding into the whitespace areas we highlighted over a year ago."",
  ""Our brand strength is evident as our growth continues to outpace our peers globally with strong and increasing demand from our B2B partners and in our growing D2C footprint."",
  ""We are investing in our production capabilities to meet the growing demand for our products, while carefully executing on our proven engineered distribution strategy to drive ASP growth, ensure healthy stock levels, and maintain strong full-price realization."",
  ""We are entering the next chapter of growth as we tap into our largest whitespace market, the APMA region."",
  ""We are increasing brand awareness, educating the consumer on the purpose of the BIRKENSTOCK footbed, and are taking market share by following our prudent playbook of disciplined, engineered distribution to support ASP."",
  ""With our growing retail presence in the region and continued investment in digital, we see a long runway of growth ahead in APMA."",
  ""As 2024 draws to a close, so does the year in which we celebrated 250 years of shoemaking tradition, shining a light on our purpose, to empower all people to walk as nature intended."",
  ""Many of our wholesale partners used this moment to create special retail placements, allocating additional shelf space for our brand."",
  ""In our whitespace region, we were investing to drive awareness."",
  ""It was great to see the strong appetite for our rich brand heritage."",
  ""As I've said before, the first 250 years were just the beginning of a much larger and more significant journey."",
  ""I would now kindly ask the operator to open our Q&A session."",
  ""Hello and , everyone, for joining us today."",
  ""On the call are Oliver Reichert, Director of Birkenstock Holding plc and Chief Executive Officer of the BIRKENSTOCK Group; and Erik Massmann, Chief Financial Officer of the BIRKENSTOCK Group."",
  ""Klaus Baumann, Chief Sales Officer; David Kahan, President of the Americas; Nico Bouyakhf, President of EMEA; Alexander Hoff, Vice President of Global Finance, will also join us for the Q&A. Today, we are reporting the financial results for our fiscal fourth quarter and full year ending September 30, 2024."",
  ""You may find the press release and supplemental presentation connected to today's discussion on our Investor Relations website, birkenstock-holding.com."",
  ""We would like to remind you that some of the information provided during the call is forward-looking and accordingly is subject to the Safe Harbor provisions of the federal securities laws."",
  ""These statements are subject to various risks, uncertainties and assumptions, which could cause our actual results to differ materially from these statements."",
  ""These risks, uncertainties and assumptions are detailed in this morning's press release as well as in our filings with the SEC, which can be found on our website at birkenstock-holding.com."",
  ""We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements or information except as required by law."",
  ""During the call, all revenue growth rates will be cited on a constant currency basis unless otherwise stated."",
  ""We will also reference certain non-IFRS financial information."",
  ""We use non-IFRS measures, as we believe they represent the operational performance and the underlying results of our business more accurately."",
  ""The presentation of this non-IFRS financial information is not intended to be considered by itself or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS."",
  ""Reconciliations of the IFRS to non-IFRS measures can be found in this morning's press release and in our SEC filings."",
  ""Before I turn it over to Oliver, I want to draw your attention to the note in our press release in 20-F regarding the change in our segment reporting beginning in fiscal 2025."",
  ""In our fiscal years up to and including 2024, our three reporting segments were the Americas, Europe and APMA, which was comprised of two operating segments, Asia Pacific and Middle East, Africa, and India."",
  ""During the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we have changed our internal organization to merge the Middle East and Africa regions with the European operating segment under the leadership of Nico Bouyakhf to create a new reporting segment, Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA."",
  ""While the India region has been merged with the Asia Pacific operating segment to create a new segment, APAC, which will continue under the leadership of Klaus Baumann."",
  ""The change was due to the operational advantages and complementary benefits between the regions."",
  ""No changes were made to the composition of the Americas operating segment."",
  ""As a result, starting with fiscal 2025, the company has three operating as well as reportable segments, Americas, EMEA and APAC."",
  ""Our first quarter 2025 results will be reported under this new segment structure."",
  ""Prior to the release of our first quarter 2025 results, we will issue a 6-K with the 2024 quarters and fiscal year and the full fiscal year 2023 recast under the new segment reporting structure to aid in your year-over-year comparison."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it over to Oliver."",
  ""I'm pleased to share BIRKENSTOCK's performance in fourth quarter and full year 2024."",
  ""Again, we saw very strong growth throughout the year, which accelerated into our fiscal year end, allowing us to achieve another year of over 20% top line growth, coming in ahead of our expectations."",
  ""First, let's look at revenues."",
  ""Fourth quarter 2024 revenues were €456 million, growth of 22% in constant currency, accelerating from third quarter's growth of 19%."",
  ""B2B was up 26% and our D2C performance was up 18%."",
  ""This brought our total revenue for fiscal year 2024 to over €1.8 billion, up 22% from 2023 and ahead of our expected growth of 20%."",
  ""B2B revenues were up 23% and D2C were up 21% for the full year."",
  ""Now, looking at gross profit."",
  ""In analyzing our fourth quarter gross profit margin, it's important to note that the prior-year quarter was impacted by several non-cash end-of-year true-up adjustments and the reclassification of logistics expenses."",
  ""Combined, these elevated Q4 2023 gross margin by approximately 450 basis points, making it not directly comparable to Q4 2024."",
  ""The adjustments did not impact EBITDA in the period."",
  ""And importantly, EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points year-over-year in the quarter."",
  ""On a reported basis, gross profit margin for fourth quarter fiscal 2024 was 59%."",
  ""The remaining 190 basis points of decline in gross margin was the result of, A, the expected under-absorption impact from new production capacity, which accounts for around 200 basis points; B, the increase in B2B share relative to the last year; and C, FX impact, all offset by some pricing initiatives."",
  ""The gross margin in Q4 2024 represents the more normalized trend."",
  ""For the full year, gross profit margin was 58.8%, down 330 basis points from full year 2023."",
  ""As expected, about 150 basis points of margin decline was the result of the temporary under-absorption costs from the added production capacity, the remaining 180 basis points from a combination of FX, channel mix and other impacts."",
  ""Selling and distribution expenditures were €141 million in the fourth quarter, representing 31% of revenue, down 640 basis points year-over-year due to, in part, the logistics reclassification into COGS, as well as lower consulting and other expenses relative to those incurred during our IPO last year."",
  ""For the full fiscal year, selling and distribution expenditures totaled €507 million or 28.1% of revenue, down from 29.8% in fiscal year 2023."",
  ""General administration expenses were €32 million or 7% of revenue in the quarter, respectively, €101 million or 5.6% of revenue for the full year 2024, up 20 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to the incremental public company costs."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 of €125 million was up 31% year-over-year, and margin of 27.4% was up 190 basis points year-over-year."",
  ""For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to €555 million or an EBITDA margin of 30.8%, down 160 basis points year-over-year, largely as a result of the capacity expansion, but coming in ahead of our expected range of 30% to 30.5%."",
  ""Adjusted net profit of €55 million in fourth quarter was up 118% and adjusted EPS was €0.29, up 107% from a year ago."",
  ""Fiscal 2024 adjusted net profit of €240 million was up 16% from 2023."",
  ""EPS of €1.28 increased 13% year-over-year."",
  ""Let's now have a closer look at our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024."",
  ""Cash and cash equivalents were €356 million as of September 30, 2024, up from €344 million at the end of fiscal 2023."",
  ""We generated €429 million operating cash flow during 2024, up 20% year-over-year."",
  ""This was driven by the strong EBITDA growth, combined with improved working capital efficiency."",
  ""We improved our inventory to sales ratio to 35%, down from 40% in 2023."",
  ""Our DSO for fiscal 2024 remained very healthy at 23, in line with year ago, despite a slightly higher B2B mix."",
  ""During 2024, we spent €74 million in capital expenditures and made net repayments of €662 million in outstanding loans."",
  ""Our net leverage was 1.8 times as of September 30, 2024, below our stated target of 2.0 times."",
  ""As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we believe we are well-positioned to meet our stated growth and profitability objectives."",
  ""Our outlook for 2025 is in line with our medium to long-term targets."",
  ""We expect revenue growth of 15% to 17% with balanced and healthy growth from both D2C and B2B. We believe this is the right pace of growth to meet demand within the guide rails of our scarcity model and maintain brand health and full-price realization."",
  ""Gross margin should improve year-over-year as we increase utilization and efficiency at our production facilities, moving closer to our 60% target."",
  ""We expect EBITDA margin in the range of 30.8% to 31.3%, an increase of up to 50 basis points compared with 2024."",
  ""Our effective tax rate is projected to be around 30%."",
  ""We expect to invest approximately €80 million in capital expenditures in 2025, primarily related to production capacity and retail store expansion."",
  ""We plan to use excess cash to continue reducing our outstanding debt."",
  ""Our target leverage ratio for the end of fiscal 2025 is approximately 1.5 times."",
  ""Now, I'm happy to hand over back to Oliver.""
]","[
  "" and congrats on another nice quarter."",
  ""So, Oliver, you cited 15% to 17% growth as the right pace for a healthy long-term business."",
  ""I guess, why do you think that's the right pace going forward or any structural change in drivers relative to the past decade of 20%-plus growth?"",
  ""And just near term, could you give us some color on what you're seeing in the first quarter relative to that 15% to 17% pace as you are cycling the toughest compare at 26% growth a year ago?"",
  ""Oliver, can you give a little bit more color on 1Q just how DTC versus B2B is performing, and how are you thinking about B2B versus DTC in F 2025 overall?"",
  ""How are you planning the business around that 15% to 17% in each of those segments?"",
  ""And then, can you maybe talk about gross margin by quarter, assuming 1Q is not up year-over-year, but just wondering when you're looking for gross margin to inflect positive?"",
  ""And then, Erik, maybe any color on the gross margin?"",
  "" for the detail there."",
  ""Let me keep going on the gross margin and how we should think about going forward into 2025."",
  ""Are there any other unusual items we need to think about as we look out at the quarterly trends?"",
  ""I know there was a big reclassification in 4Q as we roll into 1Q, 2Q. Is that an appropriate baseline to think about a year ago?"",
  ""And then, on revenues, I guess, to double click a little bit."",
  "" for the color on first quarter."",
  ""You mentioned the tough compares in the quarter."",
  ""But obviously, the D2C compare is, obviously, very tough in the first quarter."",
  ""Anything to think about between the two channels in the first quarter as that obviously affects margins?"",
  ""And then finally on SG&A, I'm just curious if you could speak to the cadence of spend this year."",
  ""It hasn't really aligned very closely with revenue growth in the past and can have a pretty material difference on earnings quarter-to-quarter."",
  ""It started growing in the mid-20s last year and ended the year much, much lower."",
  ""So I'm curious, does SG&A snap back to mid- to high-teens in the first half or is it best to think about it as like a high-single digit growth rate in the first half and it accelerates with revenues through the year?"",
  ""As you think about, I believe, the pairs were up 14% this year, ASP up around 8% this year."",
  ""How are you thinking of that going forward, especially given the production capacity that's coming more online?"",
  ""What are you looking at?"",
  ""And it also sounds like the traffic in stores, did it continue to accelerate in the current quarter?"",
  ""What are you seeing, given the increased penetration of stores and the new store openings?"",
  ""And just anything more on wholesale in the Americas, what you're seeing on order trends?"",
  ""Is it still more from existing accounts or are there new ones, too?"",
  "" very much for taking my question."",
  ""I wanted to ask a three-part question, if I may."",
  ""Last year, for fiscal year 2024, you opened 20 stores."",
  ""How many stores should we assume for this year, and should it be really weighted to Asia?"",
  ""That kind of leads us to the second question."",
  ""I think, Oliver, you mentioned China is only 15% of your APMA region, so about €30 million."",
  ""But can you talk about the positioning of the brand in China and what you think is the longer-term opportunity?"",
  ""And then lastly, you mentioned that the closed-toe offering was roughly a third of the business."",
  ""Where do you think that goes for FY 2025 and longer term?"",
  ""And on closed-toe offering, where do you think that goes for this year and over time?"",
  ""Just to unpack closed-toe a little more, can you give us some – a little flavor on the drivers within that category?"",
  ""Is that the Boston just getting a lot more breadth in the assortment that's driving a lot of that?"",
  ""Are there other kind of views that are kind of driving?"",
  ""Can you give us a little more flavor of what's driving closed-toe?"",
  ""And again, do you think that, that could approach 40%, 50% of the mix going forward?"",
  ""And lastly, what is the difference in ASP on average of closed-toed versus sandal?"",
  ""Can I ask one more follow-up, maybe more for Erik?"",
  ""In an effort to help us properly calibrate our thoughts between DTC and B2B, recognizing that in the first half of 2024, DTC led B2B, but in the back half, B2B led DTC."",
  ""In the 15% to 17% guide, can you just give us some maybe qualified – do you think B2B is higher in growth than DTC, at least for the first half or for the whole year?"",
  ""Just give us just any kind of flavor you can give us between the channels and how they should grow relative to the 15% to 17%, either higher or lower would be super helpful?"",
  ""I just wanted to step back and talk about the APMA region over the longer term."",
  ""What percentage of sales do you think it could grow to over time?"",
  ""And can you just talk about your progress on putting the distribution and partnerships in place for continued outsized growth?"",
  ""I was just hoping for an update on your progress on building the partnerships and distribution that you need to continue that growth."",
  ""And hope you and your families have very happy holidays."",
  ""Erik or Alexander, just as we think about the model that we can see from the outside, are you comfortable that we're past the restatements, regional P&L, etcetera?"",
  ""And then just higher level, really great revenue, guys."",
  ""Can you share some thoughts on how you're thinking about promotional environment at large maybe with competition versus what you're seeing for you guys?"",
  ""And then just maybe speak to the That's really great and really helpful."",
  ""And then just Erik, any way to think about when Pasewalk, as we ramp – we work through that ramp and it starts becoming a benefit to the line item?"",
  ""Best of luck for the year ahead."",
  "" for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter and year."",
  ""I wanted to ask about pricing."",
  ""It looks like price accounted for about half of the 8% ASP increase in 2024, call it 4%."",
  ""Is that a good way to think about 2025 as well?"",
  ""And a similar question on mix, that was also a big driver, just should we expect much of a change there for 2025?"",
  "" for taking my questions and happy holidays."",
  ""I just want to dig into the DTC business a little bit more, especially in Americas but in total."",
  ""When – in the Americas, the DTC business represents probably around 40-plus-percent of the sales and of that, 90% – over 90% is digital."",
  ""Will most of the DTC growth that happens in fiscal 2025 happen out of Asia and Europe ex the stores and is – and then those stores that open later, drive incrementality, is that the way to think about it?"",
  ""And what would you call a mature digital penetration, I guess, in total?"",
  ""Is that like going to be a tough number to get ahead of higher than digitally and you really just need these store – you need to just open the stores and have them really start producing and I guess over the long term – you can open 30-plus stores this year, in the long term, how many stores do you foresee – own stores do foresee globally?"",
  ""And a subtle dig to your other companies, David."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Just want to get more color on what you're seeing from a customer lens."",
  ""Is there any change you're seeing in either repeat purchase behavior or number of pairs owned?"",
  ""And also curious what you're seeing in terms of the customer demographic, are you seeing younger audience or just curious what you're seeing there?"",
  "" for the color and best of luck."",
  ""Wanted to ask on cash flow and capital allocation."",
  ""The 1.5 times net leverage guide at the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA implies just modest improvement in the net debt."",
  ""Can you talk about free cash flow objectives?"",
  ""Is there some sort of offset to cash generation in the working capital lines or does that imply some use of cash such as share repurchases?"",
  ""Erik, at the midpoint of the EBITDA guide, 1.5 times net leverage guide implies like €980 million in net debt at year-end."",
  ""That's just €25 million or so better than fiscal 2024 year-end."",
  ""What are you thinking in terms of free cash flow?"",
  ""You've given us the CapEx."",
  ""I'm curious, is there some sort of offset that's impeding the progress on the net debt?"",
  "" for taking my question and congrats on a great year."",
  ""I just wanted to come back on APAC to understand if – what are the P&L implications of APAC?"",
  ""Is it gross margin accretive?"",
  ""Is it operating margin dilutive?"",
  ""And just maybe it's anecdotal, but moving from APMA to APAC, is that linked to particular managers or particular synergies by grouping regions or countries together in a different manner than in the past?"",
  ""And just to check, I think you said China was a mid-teens contribution to APMA sales, so that's about 2%."",
  ""Is that Mainland China or is that Greater China?"",
  ""You talked a lot about closed-toed shoes and some of the newer products."",
  ""Can you just talk about your injection molded sandals business and how that performed in 4Q and what you expect to see in that business next year?"",
  ""I'll just stick to one."",
  ""I'll just follow-up on the manufacturing that you just mentioned."",
  ""In terms of your investments and the factory expansion plans, how are they progressing versus your expectation and how do you expect the additional supply to evolve over the next two to three years?"",
  ""Based on the overall demand we see, we can definitely grow faster."",
  ""But again, we have to think about our whole business for the next decade, not in quarters or years."",
  ""We have to plan mindfully, that's the core of our business here."",
  ""And remember, we are 100% vertically integrated."",
  ""So, we have to think about hiring people, sourcing raw material, investing in production, and we take the responsibility and wellbeing for over 6,000 employees globally."",
  ""It's very serious for us."",
  ""So, quality means for us not only the quality standards."",
  ""Also, in production, engineered distribution, it's a very qualitatively driven sales organization we are writing."",
  ""So, it's – quality comes through different layers, raw materials, all of it."",
  ""And just as a comparison, if you grow mid- to high-teens a year, that means you're doubling your business roughly every five years."",
  ""And if you think about the whole situation in BIRKENSTOCK, doubling the output of this organization in a five years' timeframe, that's a very, very strong growth story."",
  ""And this is how we operate as a company."",
  ""And that's why we committed to the mid- and high-teens growth during the IPO."",
  ""And we think this is the right pace for sustainable long-term growth."",
  ""And yes, you mentioned the 20%-plus, the 20%-plus was the track record for the last year."",
  ""And again, there will be periods where we can and will grow faster."",
  ""But it's just – if we feel it's right for our core make-up or our core value, then we will do this, absolutely, okay?"",
  ""And regarding Q1, we're seeing, globally, a very strong holiday season."",
  ""Given what we've seen thus in Q1, we feel very comfortable that Q1 will likely come in the higher end of our 15% to 17% annual revenue growth guidance range, even against the strong comps last year."",
  ""Remember, last year, there was like a 26% growth."",
  ""So we do think that ending up at the higher end of our guidance range will be a strong signal for the brand and the global demand, which is definitely outstripping our supply here."",
  ""So, I think it's important for you to understand – it's Oliver again, sorry – that APMA region is – we're not only focusing on China, okay."",
  ""So, we really try to control the growth in a mindful way, and say, okay, double the speed, aggressive – compared to the rest of the world, that's a good speed for us."",
  ""We try to establish a very strong Southeast Asian business, we have a very strong business in Australia, strong business in Japan where especially our own retail is catching up very, very positive and very, very – very good."",
  ""And, of course, China as a main focus for a lot of investors."",
  ""But we try to balance everything moving forward."",
  ""So don't expect crazy stuff from us in these regions, because keep in mind, if political situation changed, we – you will ask the questions exactly the other way around."",
  ""So mindful way moving forward, double the speed."",
  ""We grow in this region over 40%."",
  ""So I would say, that's a pretty nice speed in this area."",
  ""And – but don't over – don't override this."",
  ""It's really it's important and it's – but it's even more important to keep it balanced."",
  ""You're talking about the PU segment, the outdoor water-ready sandals?"",
  ""We are just working on this new segment."",
  ""Actually, it was invented to cover the more humidity tropical conditions around Southeast Asia and the APMA region in total."",
  ""All of a sudden, in the US, the outdoor segment and in Europe, this slides performed pretty good."",
  ""So, it's just a new category that will be rolled out globally."",
  ""There will be also coming up some collaboration styles and some special make-ups in some areas where we push and introduce these new wearing occasions in the, let's say, soft hiking, outdoor-ish, water-ready environment."",
  ""You may see some of it in REI in the US or Globetrotter and some other outdoor doors in Europe."",
  ""So, it's a very promising start for this new category and that's why we invested in Pasewalk in this kind of manufacturing process, because technical-wise, it's completely a different setup than the classical core plastic sandals."",
  ""I'm taking the first one on DTC and B2B growth and going forward."",
  ""So what we will see is definitely, we'll continue to see a balanced growth between DTC and B2B throughout fiscal 2025, certainly with some nuances from quarter-to-quarter as some quarters are more sell-in and some quarters are more sell-through driven."",
  ""Please be reminded that online represents 90% of our DTC currently."",
  ""So, in other words, retail is just presenting 10% of our DTC, and we've been executing our retail expansion plan with great success."",
  ""Recently opened stores are performing really well, and they are performing well from day one."",
  ""Paris, Le Marais that opened in Q4 is our top performing store in Europe."",
  ""Chengdu store is welcoming 4,000 visitors every week, outperforming our expectations, and then Austin store is also really outperforming our expectations."",
  ""Please be assured we have secured more locations – more exciting locations to open this fiscal year."",
  ""So, you'll hear us more talking about retail expansion and you'll see retail gaining more weight in our DTC channel."",
  ""Our overview on channel growth is that we want to fulfill demand where it occurs, while we really remain disciplined in our distribution for B2B. As you know, 90% of growth is really coming from existing wholesale partners."",
  ""What they do is they expand our offering."",
  ""They offer more shelf space and they go with a wider offering to their consumers."",
  ""So, this gives us a broader reach to consumers with a broader assortment and let consumers enjoy the full breadth of our brand."",
  ""We remain disciplined in our distribution for B2B, and this is a high quality and profitable growth with a full-price realization that is superior to any other brand out there."",
  ""Sorry, I didn't get the question in the beginning."",
  ""Gross margin, if you look at Q4, the gross margin last year had a number of non-cash out-of-period accounting true-ups that impacted the quarterly margin comparisons."",
  ""So, these totaled about 450 basis points, of which the majority was related to a true-up of internal logistic expenses for the year that were reclassified between COGS and selling and distribution expenses."",
  ""There was no impact on the full year gross margin and even more important, no impact at all on the EBITDA."",
  ""So this is why we should look at the quarterly trends for gross margin, EBITDA margin 2024 as a guide for 2025."",
  ""And while, as you know, we will not be giving quarterly margin guidance overall, we have said we expect a modest improvement in gross margin for 2025 and EBITDA will go up 50 basis points higher next year."",
  ""I will take the first and the third part of your question."",
  ""And with our numbers in 2024, the quarterly cadence, we are quite confident that this is a good basis to model the 2025 quarters."",
  ""So, 2024 is completely clean."",
  ""There's no hiccups, no unusual items you need to know about."",
  ""And, of course, we have some seasonality."",
  ""I'm sure you are aware of that, especially with the higher D2C penetration, the first and then the fourth quarter impacting gross margins and also SG&A ratios."",
  ""But overall, 2024 is a good basis to start with for 2025."",
  ""And then, maybe just one last remark on gross margin."",
  ""Erik mentioned that we are seeing a slight uptrend of the margin in 2025."",
  ""This will likely to happen in the back half of the year."",
  ""Well, on the SG&A, it's the same cadence and also a good starting point for the 2025 quarters."",
  ""There are fluctuations, but this is just pure seasonality and depending on the channel mix, but SG&A is also a good starting point, taking the 2024 numbers."",
  ""I'm going to take the first part of the question and then I'll hand over to my esteemed colleague, David, to give us some color on the Americas piece."",
  ""So, on units versus ASP growth, we definitely see volume being a bigger driver of growth than previous years."",
  ""As you know, finally, we have the capacity to really unlock whitespace categories such as the APMA or now APAC region, our closed-toe product category, but also other business areas such as professional."",
  ""These are all incremental fields of play to our unit growth."",
  ""Further to that, this increased capacity is also benefiting our B2B business."",
  ""It really allows us to gain shelf space with existing partners that are widening their assortment and offering."",
  ""Even with that high unit growth, we expect a positive ASP contribution to revenue growth driven by mix predominantly, but also like-for-like pricing going forward."",
  ""Dana, hey, this is David."",
  ""Just to follow up on the back half of that question."",
  ""As you've heard repeatedly from us, 90% of our growth in revenue comes from not only existing accounts, but existing doors."",
  ""So, that shows that we're getting increased shelf space, increased penetration, increased spread in our collection, mainly in our current points of distribution."",
  ""The only new points of distribution would be ones that are very, very tactical and strategic."",
  ""For us, we've spoken about this previously, but most specifically related to sport specialty where we've, over the last year, established a nice, small basis, but very, very disciplined growth in that specific channel."",
  ""I'm going to do the first part of it, which is stores related, then I'm going to hand over to Klaus for the Asia piece."",
  ""As you know, retail is a massive growth pillar for us."",
  ""We are currently operating 67 stores, adding – and have added 20 stores in 2024."",
  ""We have plans to open more."",
  ""We are very disciplined in regards of locations that we go after, but also our return requirements."",
  ""Cash payback on investment is, as you know, within 18 months."",
  ""So, yes, we do expand, but we also expand very consciously, if you will."",
  ""Our aim for fiscal 2025 is to increase the door fleet by 50%."",
  ""So that's a significant growth of our door fleet."",
  ""And as I said, every store that is opened is performing and has to perform really well from day one."",
  ""So you see us having some really exciting locations lined up."",
  ""We just opened in Europe."",
  ""As I said, Paris is a very, very great success story in Europe."",
  ""And so, there are many others in the other regions."",
  ""So more to come on that."",
  ""Klaus here, answering the China question."",
  ""First of all, it's important to know that we are not new in China."",
  ""I mean, we have a long history there."",
  ""And, yes, we are accelerating now our growth."",
  ""As you know, we signed up a partner for our B2B mono store development and we are delivering now to six point of sales, and we are operating two owned stores."",
  ""On the digital side, we opened social sales channels as TikTok and the WeChat program."",
  ""So, looking forward, I mean, we will keep this pace and make sure we for sure double the fleet."",
  ""So this is Nico again."",
  ""So, closed-toe offering, as you know, is now a third of our business and it continues to grow at the pace of more than twice as fast as our sandals."",
  ""Important to know that sandals is growing double digits, so we grow both areas of the business, while closed-toe is over-performing."",
  ""We haven't set ourselves a target for this one, but you will see an increased share of closed-toe business going forward."",
  ""First off, there's no copy and paste globally on closed-toe."",
  ""The beauty of the business is closed-toe encompasses everything from clogs to boots, and we're seeing positive momentum across every element of closed-toe."",
  ""In the US specifically, it has been driven by clogs."",
  ""The beauty of that is it's not just the Boston, it's also the Tokyo."",
  ""There's a new clog called the Lutry with a convertible strap that you may have seen out at retail that's selling very, very well."",
  ""And the impact of clogs actually is even spilling over to our Zermatt slipper, which has been in the line for five to six years, and because of the interest in clogs is now having its best season in its entire history."",
  ""Obviously, from an ASP standpoint, clogs overall, as do all of closed-toe have a higher ASP than sandals in general."",
  ""I don't know what that exact dollar amount is, but clearly, the mix certainly changes the ASP."",
  ""Again, I think the velocity of it is the sell-throughs are much higher than they are across the total collection in anything that's closed-toe right now."",
  ""I think Europe is seeing a bit more of a closed-toe shoe and boot reaction."",
  ""So, I'll pass this to Nico."",
  ""So, maybe you remember our Q1 last fiscal year, fiscal year 2024 where we saw a very, very strong success of launched boots silhouettes."",
  ""In fact, 4 out of top 10 in DTC, the top 10 sellers were laced-up shoes."",
  ""And we launched the HIGHWOOD and the PRESCOTT at a price point of €200 – above €200 and those styles really performed very well."",
  ""So, as you can see, we are spearheading not just closed-toe, but also boots and laced-up shoes in our DTC business."",
  ""And what we do is we take the great learnings and the great success into our B2B business."",
  ""And Autumn-Winter 2024 is the season that we are selling through now with our partners, was the first season where we doubled the order intake for laced-up shoes."",
  ""And for us, it was quite significant to do that because we shared the great success of our DTC and asked our partners to broaden the range with us and invest into that part of the collection."",
  ""Now, the sell-through now of exactly that order intake is doing really positive."",
  ""So, we see a continuation of the trend of last Q1, with again laced-up shoes and boots really performing well and over-performing against the rest of the business."",
  ""Hey, can you hear us?"",
  ""We dropped out by chance."",
  ""It wasn't because of the question."",
  ""So, we didn't break it down in detail, as you know, but it's moderate growth in all areas."",
  ""So it's a balanced growth to whatever the demand is asking for."",
  ""And as we have, I think, discussed in the past, the B2B business is as positive for us as D2C business margin-wise."",
  ""And therefore, I would overall and for the full year say it's a – yeah, it's a moderate growth."",
  ""It's a moderate plan with no specifics and obviously, seasonality a bit, as we have seen them in the quarters this year."",
  ""But again, overall, moderate on both sides."",
  ""I don't know whether that's enough answer."",
  ""I just want to follow-up there also."",
  ""Just a reminder that 40% of our business is already D2C, which is as you know pretty sizable business in D2C), and we'll ontinue to grow both the D2C and the B2B business as we look forward into 2025."",
  ""On the D2C side, I think you'll be looking at additional stores on the retail side, and that will be probably more toward the back half where you'll start to see a greater contribution on the D2C side versus B2B growth."",
  ""I think we are planning to grow about 30% share."",
  ""So, we are balancing out in the region."",
  ""In the growth cadence, we like to say that the APMA region should have a double speed of our mature markets."",
  ""And can you repeat the second question, please?"",
  ""As you know, we signed up a partner for China."",
  ""We are also very much focused on our D2C development right now."",
  ""And you can see that we are almost doubling the business on our D2C and partners for Southeast Asia, mainly B2B section, very well prepared and we are in context over here to open more stores."",
  ""We are operating by ourselves now 25 stores and in the B2B side, we have 256 stores."",
  ""We added like 45 stores only this year."",
  ""So, going forward, very well."",
  ""That sounded like more than one question, but , Simeon."",
  ""So, let me start with your comment regarding the P&L. It's very clear it's not a restatement."",
  ""It's a reclassification of internal logistic costs, which can be shown in sales and distribution and it can be shown in COGS and some companies do like this."",
  ""So, we sort of cleaned it up from 20232."",
  ""Now, as the majority of companies do it and so it showed in our gross margin."",
  ""So that's a reclass of internal logistic costs, noncash impact to EBITDA as you had seen Yeah."",
  ""I think on the question about the general promotional environment, I think what you're seeing is this bifurcation out there."",
  ""A lot is promoted, but the few things that people really demand, that they're intentionally shopping for are selling through at full price."",
  ""We're very fortunate that we are one of those brands."",
  ""As you know, we manage scarcity with such a high level of discipline that the amount of hash, which is our – which is the industry term for broken sizes, at any given time, is mathematically quite small."",
  ""Having said that, when you have a very developed digital business where you do carry a broad assortment, you are going to see what may be more breadth, but certainly a very, very low depth in any given style."",
  ""So specifically to the US, who I know you're referencing, with MAP pricing, we manage wholesale so tight, our retailers experience in-season well over 95% full price realization."",
  ""On our own D2C business, which again is largely digital right now, it's over 90%."",
  ""So you're going to see a bit more breadth, but certainly not any significant depth whatsoever."",
  ""Hey, Simeon, this is Alexander."",
  ""I will take that over."",
  ""Yeah,  for that part."",
  ""Overall, we are absolutely pleased with how well the expansion has gone so far, not only in our new factory in Pasewalk, but also in the existing build-out in Görlitz and in Portugal."",
  ""So the expansionary steps we did in 2023 and 2024 have been the foundation of our unit growth."",
  ""I think that's also important to mention in every single situation that it's not only pressure to margin, it gives us the opportunity to substantially grow in units."",
  ""And this was clearly a drag, especially in 2024 as expected and communicated upfront."",
  ""This was a peak year of the margin pressure and with that transitionary year we are now going into a 2025 year where we will see a better absorption as discussed already primarily in the back half of the year and we will also confirm that we expect a full absorption of fixed cost in the third quarter of 2026."",
  "" for the question, and you're absolutely right."",
  ""So, when you are looking into 2025, I think Nico mentioned also that we are expecting approximately two-thirds unit growth, approximately one-third in ASP growth."",
  ""And yes, ASP is primarily driven by like-for-like pricing and product mix, with consumers continuously buying more into higher price points and premium products."",
  ""We mentioned closed-toes as an example here."",
  ""So, higher level share but also product embellishments are supporting this trend, and this will continue into the future retail we'll have on the channel expansion, but overall in 2025, we are not expecting a major influence on ASP from a channel mix."",
  ""Take that one, I guess."",
  ""Obviously, we don't – we're not providing by channel, by region, but I think to your – to get to your question, yes, you're right on the Sam, hey."",
  ""First off, we're going to increase our door count, physical doors by 50% in 2025."",
  ""So, that's pretty aggressive as far as new door openings."",
  ""I would say – and again, it's a little bit mathematical, it's a little bit anecdotal, but I would say once you get to a 40% digital penetration in a market that becomes pretty much optimized."",
  ""It doesn't mean it's not going to grow, it will grow in revenue dollars, but as far as share of business, it may be slightly above 40%, about optimized where it is and I think we've learned over the last few years from other brands, once you try to lean into one channel versus the other, it may not serve the purpose that you're seeking it to actually serve."",
  ""So, I think we have a pretty optimal balance around the world that might play out a little different by region."",
  ""It might play out a little different by quarter."",
  ""But I would say that we have the most healthy balance in the market right now."",
  ""And as we open more retail stores and more physical touchpoints with that brand, that's going to be purely incremental Hey."",
  ""So, in regard of repeat purchases, we do have a very strong build-up of our membership base, currently 8 million members."",
  ""There you use your imagination how fast this can still grow."",
  ""It's growing – has been growing 30% year-on-year with already now members spending 30% than non-members."",
  ""So what we also typically see with members is they sort of transcend into other categories with us, let's say, more expensive categories, but also newer categories such as shoes, lace-up shoes, insole business that is typically adopted much faster than – with members than with non-members."",
  ""We've done a great job in becoming clearer on our member segments."",
  ""So, you'll see us becoming more personal in how we treat our members and more exclusive."",
  ""We have a very, very large amount of product that is exclusively meant for members that is displayed online, and that also typically sells through much, much faster than the rest of the line."",
  ""So, yes, a very healthy growth in membership, a very healthy business with members, but yet to be growing significantly."",
  ""Yes, we are apparently cash-rich, which shows the strength of our business and we hit the target of below 2 times leverage, 1.8 times end of the year, and the goal for next year is around 1.5 times."",
  ""Going forward the plan is much the same as it was this year."",
  ""First of all, invest in the business."",
  ""So, if something is needed, if we think it helps the business, we will do it."",
  ""And around €80 million is the plan for current year."",
  ""Afterwards, continue to pay down our debt."",
  ""We expect, as I said, 1.5 times leverage end of the year, eventually pay off the US term loan and everything after this will be decision made by the board, obviously."",
  ""But the strength of our business and the very strong cash flow conversion shows that we are on the right way."",
  ""Of course, we have to be free on this and we just want to be capable of investing in whatever is needed, either build-up inventory or invest into the CapEx."",
  ""Yes, for me personally, US term loan is the first priority because it's the most expensive one."",
  ""It's around $170 million plus, as you know, there's another euro term loan debt, bond and everything else will be decided by the board afterwards."",
  ""I'll take the first part and then hand over to Nico."",
  ""So, to keep it simple, on the margin side, with that share of business of your – of course, you don't get the full leverage if you compare that to a much more bigger business, but we have really nice price points in the regions."",
  ""Some markets are already quite developed, and we expect in the mid to long term no margin pressure from making that region bigger."",
  ""So, it's – so, definitely supporting that margin, but in some markets, to be fair, when starting that up and ramping, you don't have the full profitability in year one or year two, but this is fully built into our plan."",
  ""Just on the segment change, yes, we decided to realign our segment structure into Americas, EMEA and APAC."",
  ""Basically, the decision has been taken because we see structural similarities, but also operational advantages between Europe and Middle East, Africa, but also India and APAC."",
  ""So Asia Pacific with India stays under the leadership of Klaus Baumann in the new APAC segment."",
  ""Then, I will take care responsibility of the EMEA segment."",
  ""We've just started in Q1 to execute in this new segment formation and would provide all financials and segment results with the next quarter's release in February."",
  ""I think we touched on that question earlier in the call, but let me just wrap up that here's everything on plan, not only in the new factory, also the other two we are building out and this is not a plan which is done in 6 or 12 months, we started in 2022 and this will last until 2026, especially building out Görlitz."",
  ""This is absolutely on what we expected so far."",
  ""The drag on margin is nothing what will continue in 2025 and 2026."",
  ""So for now, all good here.""

  ""Let me start with the leadership change we announced earlier today."",
  ""As you've likely seen, I will be stepping down as CEO and Mike Smith, our current COO, will become Lamb Weston's next President and CEO beginning January 3, 2025."",
  ""The board and I believe now is the right time to transition to allow new leader to guide Lamb Weston into its next chapter of growth."",
  ""And I could not be more thrilled to hand over the reins to Mike."",
  ""His appointment represents the culmination of a thoughtful, years-long succession planning process by the board and we are confident he is the right leader to guide Lamb Weston forward."",
  ""Over the course of his 17 year career at Lamb Weston, Mike has developed a deep understanding of all critical aspects of our business and operational opportunities and driven growth across multiple areas of the company."",
  ""I've had the pleasure of working closely with Mike and have witnessed firsthand his value based leadership style and steadfast focus on people as well as his thorough understanding of the business."",
  ""I'm confident that with Mike at the helm, Lamb Weston will drive profit and deliver value for our shareholders."",
  ""Now turning to our results."",
  ""Our second quarter performance was below our expectations and not what we aim to achieve at Lamb Weston."",
  ""Slide 4 provides a snapshot of the key themes that we'll be discussing with you today."",
  ""We expect the challenging operating environment will persist in the near term as weak restaurant traffic trends and additional capacity expansions announced by our competitors since our Investor Day last year, add to the current imbalance in global industry supply and demand, especially outside North America."",
  ""In this new reality, we're evaluating opportunities beyond our initial restructuring plan to adjust our operations, including reducing manufacturing and supply chain costs and operating expenses."",
  ""In addition, we're evaluating opportunities to drive the top line by improving sales execution, while also expanding our total addressable market by leveraging proprietary technologies to serve non-traditional fry customers."",
  ""As we discussed on our last quarter's , we expect to significantly reduce our capital spending next year as we shift away from growth capital to focus on base, modernization and environmental capital."",
  ""We expect these steps to increase our free cash flow, which would provide more flexibility to step up capital returns to our shareholders."",
  ""We'll address each of these points during this call."",
  ""Let me now turn it over to Bernadette to discuss details on our second quarter results."",
  ""At our Investor Day more than a year ago, we provided our view of the global frozen potato industry, including our estimates of future capacity additions, as well as demand growth."",
  ""Much has changed since then, so we wanted to provide you with our updated view."",
  ""As shown on slide 8, prior to COVID, frozen potato demand in the US and our key international markets was growing above historical rates, resulting in Lamb Weston and the industry at large operating above full capacity."",
  ""While COVID affected demand for a relatively short period, we saw evidence of frozen potato demand quickly rebounding to pre-COVID levels and historical growth rates."",
  ""As a result, we strategically plan to expand capacity so we would be well-positioned to serve our customers and capture our share of growing global demand."",
  ""So starting in early 2021 and knowing that it typically takes two to three years to plan, construct, and qualify a new facility, we were one of the first processors to announce major capacity expansions and modernization of our existing production lines."",
  ""This included projects in China, Idaho, the Netherlands, and Argentina."",
  ""By the time of our Investor Day in October 2023 as you can see on the chart, some competitors had also announced capacity expansion projects."",
  ""Since then, legacy competitors, as well as some relatively new market entrants, have announced plans to construct more than 3.5 billion pounds of additional capacity between 2024 and 2027."",
  ""This primarily includes expansions in Europe, China, and Brazil, but also in relatively new frozen potato processing regions such as India and the Middle East."",
  ""While competitors' expansion announcements are always expected, we did not foresee the timing and aggregate scale of these additional expansions."",
  ""As you can see on slide 9, including these additional announcements, we expect the industry in total may add up to 8.6 billion pounds of incremental production capacity over the next four calendar years."",
  ""Given the near-term operating environment, we don't know whether all capacity expansions that have been announced will move forward and be operational by the end of calendar 2028."",
  ""That said, if all these announced capacity additions are completed and on time, and if there are no further capacity reductions other than our strategic closure of Connell, Washington facility, we estimate total industry capacity may be more than 44 billion pounds by the end of 2028, that's an additional 10 billion pounds of capacity being added between 2023 and 2028, which is 4 billion pounds more than what was added in the previous five years."",
  ""This has an implication for industry capacity utilization."",
  ""In 2024, we estimate capacity utilization is around 90%, which itself is down from the high-90s during the past couple of years, due to the slowdown of global demand and the addition of nearly 3 billion pounds of incremental supply by Lamb Weston and our peers."",
  ""Over the next few years, we expect capacity utilization maybe in the mid to high-80s."",
  ""Accordingly, and again, assuming all the announced expansion projects are completed or not significantly delayed, we expect the operating environment will remain challenged through the medium term, even if demand returns to historical rates as incremental capacity expansions add to the current imbalance in global industry supply and demand, especially outside North America."",
  ""As you see on slide 10, we have again been an early mover to implement actions to combat the challenging environment."",
  ""Nearly three months ago, we announced a restructuring plan to address the imbalance and improve our cost structure."",
  ""This included reducing head count, permanently closing a processing facility and temporarily curtailing production lines and schedules."",
  ""We remain on track to deliver on the $55 million of cost savings associated with this plan in fiscal 2025 and annualized cost savings of $85 million in fiscal 2026."",
  ""In addition, as I noted earlier, we're continuing to evaluate and execute opportunities to adjust our supply chain operations and support functions to effectively manage through this challenging environment, protect our profitability and improve free cash flow."",
  ""We brought on a new Chief Supply Chain Officer about four months ago and we're encouraged to see the opportunity she and the team identified to reduce our manufacturing and supply chain costs."",
  ""In the back half of the year, we'll have more to say about these initiatives to improve performance and profitability."",
  ""Let me now turn over the call to Bernadette to discuss our updated outlook."",
  ""So let me just summarize today by saying we expect the operating environment in the near term will remain challenging as additional capacity expansions are announced during a period of ongoing pressure on demand."",
  ""We are proactively adapting to this dynamic environment by strategically adjusting our footprint, reducing capital expenditures, managing our cost structure and improving cash flow."",
  ""At the same time, we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders through opportunistic share repurchases and steady increases in our dividend, while continuing to maintain and modernize our production assets."",
  ""Overall, we remain well-positioned with the unique strength and scale that Lamb Weston system provides navigated tough industrywide operating environment."",
  ""We're taking actions to adapt our operations to weather these transitory challenges and make lasting improvements to our operations."",
  ""And we'll continue to leverage our solid fundamentals and balance sheet to continue to deliver value to our shareholders."",
  ""Before taking questions, I just want to end with saying again that serving as Lamb Weston's President and CEO has been a privilege and an honor, and I'm proud of what the entire Lamb Weston team has accomplished during these last eight years."",
  ""With Mike and his leadership team at the helm, Lamb Weston's future is in great hands."",
  "" for joining us this morning."",
  ""Now, let me turn it back over to Dexter."",
  ""Earlier today, we issued our earnings press release and posted our slides that we'll use for today's call."",
  ""You can find both on our website, lambweston.com."",
  ""Please note that during our remarks, we'll make some forward-looking statements about the company's expected performance that are based on how we see things today."",
  ""Actual results may differ materially due to risks and uncertainties."",
  ""Please refer to the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our SEC filings for more details on our forward-looking statements."",
  ""Some of today's remarks include non-GAAP financial measures."",
  ""These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a replacement for and should be read together with our GAAP results."",
  ""You can find the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations in our  and the appendix to our presentation."",
  ""With me today are Tom Werner, our President, Chief Executive Officer; and Bernadette Madarieta, our Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Let me now turn the call over to Tom."",
  ""Starting on slide 5, you can see that net sales declined 8% compared with the year ago quarter."",
  ""Volume declined 6%, primarily driven by declining restaurant traffic in the US and many of our key international markets."",
  ""Customer share losses net of gains and the carryover impact of our decisions last year to exit certain lower priced and lower margin business in EMEA to strategically manage customer and product mix."",
  ""While the effects of these three factors were largely in line with our expectations, the declines in sales and volume were more than what we anticipated for the quarter, as we experienced incremental customer share losses in both business segments due to an increasingly competitive environment."",
  ""Price mix declined 2% as compared to the prior year quarter, which was just below our target for the period."",
  ""Our pricing actions in North America were in line with our expectations."",
  ""However, pricing in our international markets was more competitive."",
  ""Channel and product mix was also in line with our expectations."",
  ""But unfavorable versus the prior year quarter reflecting customer share losses, exceeding customer gains."",
  ""For our North America segment specifically, sales declined 8% versus the prior year quarter."",
  ""Volume declined 5% and included the carryover impact of smaller and regional customer share losses in food away from home channels in the prior year and share losses in certain chain restaurant accounts."",
  ""The majority of the decline, however, was due to the drop in restaurant traffic in the US."",
  ""According to restaurant industry data providers, US restaurant traffic in the second quarter declined about 2% versus the prior year, although trends improved modestly versus our fiscal first quarter as QSR did continue to step up promotional activity."",
  ""Traffic at QSR chains specializing in hamburgers in the second quarter, declined about 1.5% versus the year ago period."",
  ""We continue to be encouraged by the improving trend in traffic and the steady fry attachment rate."",
  ""But as a reminder, many of these promotional meal deals have consumers trading down from a medium serving size to a small French fries serving size."",
  ""As a result, while we benefit from improving traffic trends, the effect of the trade down in serving sizes acts as a partial and with some customers a significant headwind to our volumes."",
  ""Price mix in North America declined 3%, reflecting the planned investments that we made to retain and attract volume as well as unfavorable channel and product mix."",
  ""For our International segment, sales declined 6% versus the prior year quarter."",
  ""Volume declined 6%, driven by several factors."",
  ""First, restaurant traffic declined or softened sequentially in many of our key international markets."",
  ""While restaurant traffic in the UK, our largest market in Europe, was flat."",
  ""Traffic declined in Germany, France and Spain."",
  ""In Japan, QSR traffic grew versus the prior year, but decelerated versus our fiscal first quarter."",
  ""Traffic growth in China remained soft."",
  ""Second, we experienced incremental customer share losses resulting from a more intense competitive environment."",
  ""Most notably in the Middle East and certain markets in Asia-Pacific."",
  ""And third, we continued to realize the carryover effect of exiting certain lower priced and lower margin business in EMEA."",
  ""This was the last quarter that this will serve as a headwind."",
  ""Price mix was flat versus the prior year quarter as incremental pricing actions to compete in key international markets offset the benefit of inflation driven pricing actions in EMEA."",
  ""Moving on from sales, on slide 6, you can see that adjusted EBITDA fell $95 million versus the prior year quarter to $282 million."",
  ""The decrease is largely attributable to a $135 million decline in adjusted gross profit."",
  ""That was due primarily to four factors."",
  ""First, price mix declined due to the planned pricing actions to retain customers and attract incremental volume."",
  ""Second, higher manufacturing cost per pound, which reflects input cost inflation and inefficiencies associated with lower production and lower factory and potato utilization rates."",
  ""Third, we incurred incremental production costs related to unplanned facility downtimes and additional startup costs associated with our new capacity expansion."",
  ""And finally, while not impacting EBITDA, we incurred $16 million of higher depreciation expense that's largely related to our capacity expansions in China and Idaho that were completed last fiscal year."",
  ""Adjusted SG&A declined $12 million to $165 million."",
  ""We reduced adjusted SG&A despite an incremental $7 million of non-cash amortization related to our new ERP system that went live in the third quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""Continued execution of our expense reduction initiatives, including those associated with our restructuring plan, drove most of the improvement, with the remainder largely due to lower performance based compensation and benefit accruals."",
  ""For North America specifically, adjusted EBITDA declined $55 million to $267 million, driven by a combination of unfavorable price mix, lower sales volumes, higher manufacturing cost per pound, and incremental production costs."",
  ""For our International segment, adjusted EBITDA declined $53 million to $47 million."",
  ""Higher manufacturing cost per pound and incremental production cost drove the decline, and the increasingly competitive environment in each region affected our ability to use price to fully offset inflation."",
  ""Moving to our liquidity position and cash flow on slide 7."",
  ""We ended the second quarter with about $80 million of cash and $1.2 billion available under our revolving credit facility."",
  ""Our net debt was $4 billion, which puts our leverage ratio at 3.4 times on a trailing 12-month basis."",
  ""In the first half of the year, we generated nearly $430 million of cash from operations, which is down about $25 million versus the prior year due to lower earnings, which were partially offset by favorable changes in working capital."",
  ""Capital expenditures for the first half of the year, net of proceeds from blue chip swap transactions in Argentina, were $486 million, as we completed our expansion in the Netherlands during the second quarter and continued construction of our Argentina facility."",
  ""We expect our capital spending during the second half of the year to significantly decline, as we continue to target total annual capital expenditures of $750 million in fiscal 2025."",
  ""During the quarter, we returned about $52 million to shareholders in the form of cash dividends."",
  ""We did not repurchase any shares under our share repurchase authorization during the second quarter."",
  ""I'll now turn it back over to Tom, who will cover the next few slides."",
  ""While we anticipated a challenging environment for the balance of fiscal 2025 during our last , our performance so far has fallen short of expectations."",
  ""As a result, we're reducing our financial targets for the year to reflect our performance in the second quarter, as well as the increasingly competitive environment that Tom just described."",
  ""As you can see on slide 11, we're reducing our net sales target range to $6.35 billion to $6.45 billion from our previous range of $6.6 billion to $6.8 billion."",
  ""Using the midpoint of the new sales range implies a sales decline of 1% versus fiscal 2024."",
  ""We're also reducing our adjusted EBITDA target range to $1.17 billion to $1.21 billion from our previous estimate of around $1.38 billion."",
  ""Let me walk you through the key changes."",
  ""On slide 12, you can see that about one fourth of the reduction in our annual sales target reflects the shortfall versus expectations during the second quarter."",
  ""The remainder reflects the combination of factors that affect the second half of the year."",
  ""In North America, we expect incremental sales volume pressure due to the impact of unexpected loss of a chain restaurant customer, partially offset by the benefit of some new customer wins and a greater than forecasted impact from the downsizing and serving size related to promotional meals at key customers."",
  ""Our forecast for price mix in North America is down modestly from our previous estimate due to less favorable mix than we previously anticipated."",
  ""Our forecast specifically for price is essentially unchanged as the pricing environment, while competitive, remains largely in line with our initial expectations."",
  ""In our International segment, we expect volume to be below our previous forecast, primarily reflecting incremental customer share losses resulting from a more intense competitive environment, as well as softer restaurant traffic in key international markets."",
  ""In addition, we expect incremental pricing pressure in each of our regions, but for different reasons."",
  ""In Asia Pacific and Latin America, we're experiencing an increasingly competitive environment as demand growth slows and as additional supply from Europe and newer entrants in India, China and the Middle East gained share."",
  ""In EMEA, we're moderating some of the inflation driven pricing actions that we implemented earlier this year to counter the initial surge in the market price of potatoes."",
  ""In short, we expect the 1% decline in total Lamb Weston net sales versus the prior year will be driven by low to mid-single digit decline in price mix, partially offset by a low single digit increase in volume growth."",
  ""With respect to adjusted EBITDA on slide 13, you can see that nearly one-third of the $190 million reduction in our annual adjusted EBITDA target reflects the shortfall in our performance in the second quarter versus expectations."",
  ""Most of the remaining reduction in our EBITDA forecast is due to the impact of a more competitive environment in our key international markets, which is affecting volume and our ability to pass along input cost inflation."",
  ""It's also due to the reductions in volume and less favorable mix in North America that I described earlier."",
  ""In addition, relative to our previous forecast, we expect to incur increased manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies from lower asset and potato utilization."",
  ""With respect to SG&A, we're maintaining our current range of $680 million to $690 million, but will likely be towards the top end of the range."",
  ""As you can see on slide 14, based on our updated annual financial forecast, for the second half of the year, we expect to deliver sales of $3.1 billion to $3.2 billion, implying growth of 1% to 4% as compared with the prior year period."",
  ""We expect higher volume in both International and North America will drive overall sales growth."",
  ""We forecast that our international segment will contribute the majority of the overall volume increase, primarily reflecting the benefit of incremental volume from recent chain customer contract wins across each of our geographic regions, net of recent share losses, lapping the impact of cancelled shipments associated with last year's ERP transition, as well as the impact of the voluntary product withdrawal that affected our results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""We expect North America volume growth to also reflect the benefit of lapping cancelled shipments associated with last year's ERP transition continued progress in regaining share of regional and small customers lost in the prior year and incremental volume from recent chain customer contract wins net of share losses."",
  ""We expect overall price mix will be down in the second half of the year."",
  ""In North America, we're forecasting price mix will decline as pricing actions more than offset benefits of improved product and channel mix."",
  ""As I previously noted, our price investments are consistent with our prior expectations."",
  ""In International, we're forecasting overall price mix will also decline due to pricing actions in response to competitive dynamics in key international markets."",
  ""Moving to earnings, in the second half, we expect to deliver $600 million to $640 million of adjusted EBITDA, which is in line with what we delivered in the prior period."",
  ""Overall, we expect to benefit from incremental volume growth in both international and North America will drive EBITDA growth, but will be largely offset by planned investments in price in North America, incremental price actions in key international markets, and the impact of input cost inflation and increased manufacturing costs due to inefficiencies from lower asset and potato utilization, which we are actively working to address."",
  ""Now turning to our thoughts on capital expenditures on slide 15."",
  ""As I previously noted, we're continuing to target total capital expenditures of approximately $750 million for fiscal 2025."",
  ""We spent about $485 million during the first half of the year as we completed our expansion in the Netherlands and continued construction of our Argentina facility."",
  ""Spending in the second half of the year will focus on maintenance, modernization and the continued construction of our Argentina facility, which is on track to be completed in mid-calendar 2025."",
  ""For 2026, we're continuing to target total capital expenditures of approximately $550 million."",
  ""We expect about $400 million will be for base maintenance capital and modernization efforts, which is in line with our annual depreciation and amortization expense."",
  ""The other $150 million will be for environmental capital projects that largely focus on wastewater treatment at our manufacturing facilities."",
  ""As we highlighted last quarter, we expect to spend about $500 million in total over the next five years to comply with increasingly strict government regulations and permit limitations."",
  ""For at least a few years beyond 2026 given our expectations for lower industry capacity utilization, we do not expect to direct any significant investments to growth capital."",
  ""We'll focus our spending on base and modernization capital, which together is generally up to 5% of sales, plus an additional $75 million or so each year for environmental projects."",
  ""As a result, fiscal 2026 should be a positive inflection point for our free cash flow."",
  ""Note that the annual amounts that I just described exclude any capital we expect to deploy when we restart the next phase of our ERP implementation."",
  ""Turning to our thoughts on capital return to shareholders on slide 16."",
  ""Today, we announced a $250 million increase to our share repurchase authorization."",
  ""With this increase, we have approximately $560 million remaining under our authorization."",
  ""As has been our practice, we'll continue to use a disciplined approach to repurchasing shares."",
  ""But the increased authorization combined with the increase in expected free cash flows, provides us with the flexibility to opportunistically buy back shares under the program."",
  ""With respect to dividends, we declared a $0.01 increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.37 per share."",
  ""This is consistent with our history of increasing our dividend each year since becoming a public company more than eight years ago."",
  ""Our target dividend payout ratio remains 25% to 35% of earnings per share."",
  ""While we're above that range today, that's a result of temporarily depressed earnings."",
  ""Let me now turn the call back over to Tom for some closing comments."",
  ""Before opening up the call for questions, I just want to note that Mike and Bernadette will be on the road with investors in January."",
  ""We'll provide details for those meetings shortly after the start of the new year."",
  ""With that, we're now ready to take your questions.""
]","[
  ""Tom, I guess, even assuming 3% annual demand growth over time, and obviously that's a lot more than what we currently see, as you talked about, capacity utilization by 2028 would only get back to around 90% and that's certainly below where it's been historically in more the mid to high-90s."",
  ""I guess in light of this, what do you now view as Lamb Weston's sort of structural or normalized EBITDA margin?"",
  ""And is it lower – or maybe appropriately, how much lower is it than what you might have previously thought?"",
  ""And then I've got a follow-up."",
  ""And then, Tom, in light of the industry dynamic and some of the incremental capacity and such, why do you think other players have not yet made sort of similar decisions to curtail production or perhaps close or shutter older, less efficient facilities, given all the new capacity that's coming on stream as you have?"",
  ""Because, again, typically it's been an industry that's been rational, and that obviously seems to be sort of breaking down now quite materially."",
  ""Tom, I actually wanted to spend some time on the international business, because I think there's a lot of moving parts there that maybe are not fully appreciated."",
  ""So maybe we can start with Europe."",
  ""I mean, I think you've called out some incremental pressure."",
  ""It seems like you're expecting more."",
  ""I'm not sure how much of that is tied to the fact that you were expecting maybe a tighter potato crop this year that ended up coming in better, and so competitors feel the ability to kind of price discount a bit more."",
  ""So maybe if you can start with that on Europe."",
  ""And then as it relates to Asia, calling out the incremental pressure and I think the share pressure that you're seeing now, just how you think about that with already existing in light of the capacity that's coming."",
  ""So why would it not necessarily get worse in some of those markets as the slide kind of outlines, there's quite a bit of capacity expected to come online."",
  ""So, I know there's a lot there, but maybe if you could address, again, Europe and then the Asia markets kind of separately would be helpful."",
  ""And then I guess just on the back of Andrew's question around EBITDA margins, if I can take it up to the gross margin level, there's been obviously quite a bit of deleverage as a result of, I think, idling the capacity, Bernadette, I think you called out some other factors that hopefully we can go through."",
  ""But I guess the question is, look, if the deleverage, is it more than you expected or are there just other manufacturing elements that have come in that again this gross margin now we run out at a significantly lower level."",
  ""I just... ...wanted to clarify on the – hi, ."",
  ""I wanted to clarify on the customer losses that were not expected."",
  ""To what extent was pricing the determinant of these losses?"",
  ""I know there was mention of in Asia some ERP challenges."",
  ""So I'm just trying to understand, like if customer service was part of the consideration here with some of those lack of wins that were expected."",
  ""And I did see the expanded buyback program."",
  ""Just how aggressive, I guess, are you willing to be as you watched the shares maybe a bit lower today?"",
  ""The activist reiterated its opinion this morning that in addition to management changes, Lamb requires significant board change or should be sold just to quote them."",
  ""I know you don't know every board members intention."",
  ""But Tom, you're on the board, you may have some insight here."",
  ""I'm just curious, is it your belief at this time that there will be meaningful board changes, that the board is open to Lamb being sold?"",
  ""And if you can't comment, do you at least know if the company plans on issuing a formal response to the activist's letter?"",
  ""Following up, how do you see in terms of guidance, I know there's a lot of moving pieces in the back half, certainly some easier comparisons, just as we think about underlying volume trends, right, excluding changes to customers the lap."",
  ""Are you expecting any kind of improvement sequentially in consumer demand for your products?"",
  ""Again, just on a like-for-like basis, if that's even possible to kind of parse out?"",
  ""Similar to Ken's question, are there any assumptions in your back half about regaining customers that you lost from the ERP disruption?"",
  ""Do you have to get new business wins in the back half starting from today in order to achieve those numbers?"",
  ""And a quick follow up."",
  ""You lost another chain customer in North America, is there any concerns about reputation risk from the missteps in calendar 2024?"",
  ""What are your customers saying about their willingness to trust Lamb Weston as a supplier?"",
  ""Tom, maybe just kind of a basic question for you on the incremental capacity you now see coming online over the next three, four years."",
  ""What do you think drove those players to decide to add all that capacity just given the operating backdrop globally?"",
  ""And then number two, we've always forever kind of spoken about fairly defragmented market obviously in the United States with kind of opportunity to defragment globally, but now kind of what we're hearing as well that fragmentation ex-US actually is causing some of this issue because you have some of these smaller players that are leading in and decide, well, let's all add this new capacity because maybe we can get some of the margin too, we can get some of that profit, too."",
  ""It just seems clearly like this is the first time this much has been added outside of the US."",
  ""And it doesn't sound like we're talking about kind of the core three other players that we normally when we talk Lamb in the US."",
  ""And then Bernadette, I hate to be a little nit picky here, but there is the one side, right, when you kind of map out that CapEx when you talk about the CapEx kind of starting to come off at least the growth CapEx in fiscal 2026 and I think the total number still for CapEx is $550 million, which is similar to what you've spoken to in the past."",
  ""But there's that little circle, right, it's a 6% to 8%, which I'm assuming as I look at the chart, 6% to 8% of sales implied."",
  ""Now, clearly, you've guided to 2025, right."",
  ""We know what CapEx is, we can kind of reverse engineer to get to what then you think your implied sales would be in 2026 to get to 6% to 8%?"",
  ""And it does – it seems a little high, let's say, on the sales side."",
  ""So, is that like just to clarify, like you're very comfortable with the $550 million, I guess we'll see if it winds up being 6% to 8% of sales kind of that way?"",
  ""So, can I turn to the demand side of the equation?"",
  ""We talked a lot about capacity and competitors this morning."",
  ""What is your research telling you about the reasons for the weak consumer demand?"",
  ""And I imagine the reasons might be quite different between US and Europe."",
  ""And specifically are you seeing any impact at the moment about on the uptake of GLP-1 weight loss drugs, particularly here in the US?"",
  ""I'm just wondering how that informs your expectations about an improvement in demand going forward."",
  ""And then I have a follow-up."",
  ""And as a follow-up, you mentioned in your opening remarks, new TAM opportunities with non-traditional customers."",
  ""Can I ask about how large those markets are and exactly what they are that you're going after?"",
  ""I wanted to go back to capacity utilization from a slightly different perspective."",
  ""When you talk about the low 90s utilization today, I mean, how does Lamb's utilization compare to that industry benchmark?"",
  ""I guess what I'm trying to get at is how much of the industry slack is in your business?"",
  ""I guess – and then I want to just dig back into just the business that's been slower to win back than you had hoped."",
  ""I guess to boil it down, I guess the question is really like, what's the sales pitch to those accounts?"",
  ""And is there really any lever you can lean on besides price to the extent that the competition, who's now servicing those accounts, is doing a good job?"",
  ""Hey,  for the question."",
  ""I wanted to turn back to the comment on the 19% to 20% EBITDA margin being an estimate for the go-forward level in the current supply-demand environment."",
  ""So that does look to be roughly in line with how you're guiding for the second half EBITDA margin that you've also observed today that your earnings in 2025 are temporarily depressed."",
  ""Clearly, there's price investments going on, there's manufacturing inefficiencies, there's other pressures that could abate."",
  ""And then you'll also be getting benefits from all the cost cutting initiatives that you're just starting to get after."",
  ""So I'm trying to get more clarity on what you see as your normalized adjusted EBITDA margin and why it would not be higher than the 19% to 20% that you're expecting for the second half of this fiscal year."",
  ""Tom, you talked about initiatives to improve the impact of the lower utilization for manufacturing."",
  ""Can you just provide a little more color about how you address that both in the near term and over time?"",
  ""And along with that, you temporarily suspended production on some lines."",
  ""Has the impact of that suspension?"",
  ""Has that been in line with your expectations or is it contributed to more of some of the production inefficiencies we've seen?"",
  ""And one clarification, you mentioned your utilization rate or Lamb's utilization rate improving from here."",
  ""Is that a reflection of the improving traffic trends?"",
  ""And I'll leave it there and pass it on."",
  ""Just a little more on the utilization, just asking in a different way."",
  ""So you believe you're currently in line with industry rate in the low-90s?"",
  ""And most of the forward incremental capacity you laid out through 2028 is from competitors."",
  ""So would you expect to be ahead of industry capacity utilization over the medium term?"",
  ""And then finished goods inventory elevated coming out of Q1, inventory seemed higher in Q2."",
  ""Any color on how much progress you had working through that during the quarter?"",
  ""Where are you currently versus normalized levels?"",
  ""And when would you expect production at line more or less limit?"",
  ""Just one question on leverage."",
  ""I know your CapEx is coming down next year, but looking at the balance of CapEx coming down, increased buyback, increased dividend, just have you changed your leverage target?"",
  ""Are you there or have you had conversations with the agencies?"",
  ""Yeah, Andrew, I think, based on our re-guide here today and going forward, assuming all that capacity comes online and there's no other industry adjustments to the footprint, we believe the go forwards in the range of, on an EBITDA basis, 19% to 20%."",
  ""Yeah, Andrew, I think, as Lamb Weston, we're managing our business based on the environment that we're operating in, and I'm certain that the rest of the industry is evaluating the dynamics right now, and it remains to be seen."",
  ""But I would anticipate there may be some actions from our competitors, but it remains to be seen based on the environment."",
  ""So Europe, initially the crop was projected to be below average."",
  ""It recovered through the growing season."",
  ""So, you had some initial high-cost open potatoes the industry procured and then the crop came down."",
  ""So, with that and the competitiveness of that market, it's been difficult to get inflation pass-through in terms of – to the customer."",
  ""And so that's really driving the pressure on the European market."",
  ""And the other part of your question in terms of Asia, I would say that one of the – and we're getting some traction."",
  ""But as you recall, when we had our ERP challenges, we protected a lot of the North America customers and we had some impact on our international, specifically in Asia customers."",
  ""And so, there's – while the team is doing a great job winning back some of that business, it's just a little bit more competitive than we anticipated and will be going forward."",
  ""Yeah, I think the initial, we've had some production manufacturing challenges early this fiscal year in terms of efficiencies and plants running throughput and hitting production schedules."",
  ""And so that's been really disappointing."",
  ""We've got a new Chief Supply Chain Officer who's focused on that going forward and have a number of different things identified."",
  ""And we are seeing improvements and – but as we continue to focus on production improvements, it's going to take some time to get us back to normal operating efficiency levels."",
  ""Ken, we're here today to talk about earnings, our outlook, what's going on in the business, and more importantly, the transition about Mike running the company going forward."",
  ""So I'll leave it at that."",
  ""But that's what we're here to talk about today."",
  ""So, in terms of really across the board from a customer standpoint, certainly we've had to address and repair some of those relationships."",
  ""But by and large, I think we're through most of the – some of the challenging discussions we've had."",
  ""And it takes time, but I feel great about where we are with our large customers and even some of the foodservice channel business, it's taken us more time than what we had previously anticipated to regain some of those accounts that were impacted by some of the challenges we had a year ago."",
  ""So, when you step back and you go look at between 2017 and 2022, there was about 3 billion pounds that were added in the industry."",
  ""And all that capacity got utilized based on the demand growth."",
  ""And as I said in my remarks, in 2023 – two, three years ago, as we saw demand recovering at historical rates, we made the strategic decision to expand our footprint."",
  ""And so subsequent to that, obviously, there's been some additional capacity expansions in Europe, India and China as well as North America that I think the industry was seeing the same category growth rates."",
  ""The environment we're dealing with today is, we're seeing restaurants slowdown in a lot of markets."",
  ""And so I think I think the industry has seen the same thing in terms of category growth and it's slowed down."",
  ""And so we view this as a transitory situation."",
  ""And I think, as I said earlier, at some of the capacity announcements, we'll see if they actually come to fruition based on the environment or they're delayed."",
  ""So I think it's a combination of the industry kind of viewing the categories the same and the categories change, and that's been the big driver."",
  ""Hey, Alexia, just one thing... ... Yeah."",
  ""So, Alexia, I'm not going to get into specifics in terms of volume potential and specific customer opportunities."",
  ""But the way to think about it is things that we've done in the past with some of our customers that traditionally didn't offer fries and/or tater tots, that's some of the things we're looking at with some potentially new customer entrants into the frozen potato category."",
  ""And I'll just leave it at that."",
  ""So the footprint adjustments we made several months ago brought us back up into the low 90% range and that's the reason we did it."",
  ""We feel comfortable about where our utilization is today."",
  ""And as I stated earlier, we've had some challenges across our footprint with some unplanned downtime and other maintenance issues that we're addressing."",
  ""And we're seeing more efficient utilization in the past period and it's improving."",
  ""But overall, the reasons we made the changes we made was to get our utilization rate kind of in the low-90s, and we'll improve on that."",
  ""No, some of it is price, there's no question about it."",
  ""But we also – as we're talking to those customers, it's talking about different products, different innovation, potentially some – if they're doing a like value-added menu offering."",
  ""So there's some different discussions that we're having going forward."",
  ""And we're winning some of that back."",
  ""It's just taking longer than what we anticipated."",
  ""No, it's been largely in line with our expectations, the production challenges we've had, were unplanned."",
  ""And the run rates for a number of different reasons weren't up to where we normally expect them to be."",
  ""And again, I'll reiterate, they've improved and they're improving."",
  ""And we've had some startup issues with the Kruiningen plant and a little bit in American Falls that we didn't anticipate."",
  ""We got the teams working on and we expect that to continue to improve and get to normalized levels here in the near-term."",
  ""No, it's more of a reflection of the – how we're processing the potatoes in the plant and the utilization rate and just being more efficient with how we're running the lines and assuming that we've got a lot of the issues here in the last three, four months addressed going forward."",
  ""We're expecting to be running more normalized here for the back half of the year."",
  ""No, I think we're generally in line."",
  ""I know there's some competitors that from what we understand, are running higher."",
  ""But I think overall, we're at kind of industry standard right now."",
  ""And then, Andrew, we'll look to expand margins by pricing to offset inflation over the longer term."",
  ""But as Tom said, in the short to medium term environment, we're expecting 19% to 20% EBITDA margins."",
  ""And Andrew, over the long term, we expect it's going to be a generally balanced based on the confidence and continued category growth, positive French fry attachment rate."",
  ""This is just a short term to medium term that we're going to have to work through this, and we'll continue to evaluate any additional opportunities to reduce costs and make sure we profitably manage the business as we move forward in this difficult environment."",
  ""And Tom, the only thing I'd add to that in the Asia market, with the increased capacity that's come online there, it becomes more of an export market than it ever has been."",
  ""And so we'll continue to look for that as opportunities to move sales profitably as well."",
  ""And then just a reminder, as it relates to the back half margins, seasonally, we'll always see gross margins in the third quarter be a little bit higher than in the fourth quarter."",
  ""Not only will it be affected by seasonality, but we'll have the absence of some of those things that affected us in the first half of the year related to the product withdrawal and some of the inventory write-offs that we had previously talked about."",
  ""As it relates to customer losses, every year we go into the negotiation and it's a very competitive environment."",
  ""And so some of that's going to be related to price, there wasn't necessarily any ERP or other industry service factors at all."",
  ""We continue to service our customers, but it's a competitive environment and more competitive than we originally thought it was going to be as we entered into the second quarter."",
  ""So as we move forward, and I mentioned the back half of the year, we're going to have more free cash flow because most of our capital investments were made in the first half of the year."",
  ""As we have more free cash flow, we're going to opportunistically be in the market and buy back shares, and we're excited to have the increased authorization that we announced today as well, the additional $250 million as we move forward."",
  ""So, we'll leave it at that."",
  ""But again, we'll have that additional free cash flow as we focus more on maintenance and base capital and modernization efforts moving forward."",
  ""We are expecting incremental volume from customer wins that I think even previously we've been talking about the fact that we'd start seeing the benefit of those in the third quarter."",
  ""The numbers that we've included in the back half of the year, include all of our line of sight to customer wins that we have in place."",
  ""So no, there isn't a large amount in there that is unknown business wins."",
  ""I'm very comfortable with the $550 million."",
  ""As it relates to US demand, most of the decline in demand versus the prior year relates to there being the fifth consecutive quarter, where consumers have continued to face inflation and we've seen declines in restaurant traffic."",
  ""So that's the primary reason that we're seeing that."",
  ""As it affects our business, there's more value promotion meals."",
  ""And when those value promotion meals drive the increased traffic, we see consumers trading down, and there's been a bigger impact on that and we've adjusted then our forecast accordingly."",
  ""If we turn to the international markets, overall the restaurant traffic trends there have slowed sequentially as well, as compared with the first quarter, as they're continuing to adjust to menu price inflation as well."",
  ""We have not though seen a large impact from GLP-1 based on everything that we've seen to-date."",
  ""We'll continue to monitor it, but from a demand perspective, we're not expecting anything significant in the long term."",
  ""Yeah, we're focused on consistency, quality, customer service, and then if there's anything we can bring to the table in terms of LTOs, those are the conversations that we're having, in addition to price and the competitive environment."",
  ""Yeah,  for the question."",
  ""In the short to medium term, we expect the pressures to continue."",
  ""Certainly, we are doing everything we can from a cost view to make sure that we can continue to increase the profitability and we'll continue to do that over time."",
  ""But right now, in the short to medium term, with the pressures that we've been seeing, we're going to go ahead and guide at the 19%, 20% range for EBITDA margins and we'll come back as we're able to show more in terms of what those improvements and other things look to be."",
  ""As again, our new Chief Supply Chain Officer has been here four months, but we've got a lot of positive things we're seeing just this period, but one to wait until we've got a more robust plan to come back with on that."",
  ""As it relates to second and third quarters, our raw material inventory and our finished goods inventory are usually at their peak because we've just harvested potatoes in September and October."",
  ""So you usually see that peak and then we'll continue to work those inventories down as we move forward throughout the balance of the year."",
  ""Yeah, no change to our leverage target."",
  ""We continue to target the 3.5 times leverage ratio."",
  "", everyone, for joining the call today."",
  ""If you have any follow up questions, please email me and we could schedule a time to do so."",
  ""Again,  and have a happy holiday, everyone.""

  "", Brent, for the financial overview."",
  ""As always, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today and your interest in ClearSign."",
  ""The call today, we've decided to change the format from previous calls."",
  ""We've received positive responses from previous presentations narrated in a question-and-answer format, and we believe that this will provide a more engaging call."",
  ""We've also invited questions to be sent in by email."",
  ""So, we're trying something new and we'll be interested in any feedback."",
  ""So, Matthew Selinger will lead the question-and-answer session where we will go through our different product lines and business updates."",
  ""So, the overall subjects and updates covered will be much like our previous calls."",
  ""We will review our product line starting with our process burners and then move on to boiler burners."",
  ""Now, for that, I want to give some attention to our Flare product line since there's been a recently announced order and additional activity there."",
  ""I'll wrap up by discussing the outlook for the rest of the year and into 2025."",
  ""So, with that, I'll step back and hand it over to Matt."",
  ""Welcome, everyone, to the ClearSign Technologies Corporation Third Quarter 2024 Results Conference Call."",
  ""During this conference call, the company will make forward-looking statements."",
  ""Any statement that is not a statement of historical fact is a forward-looking statement."",
  ""This includes remarks about the company's projections, expectations, plans, beliefs and prospects."",
  ""These statements are based on judgments and analysis as of the date of this conference call and are subject to numerous important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements."",
  ""The risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements made in this conference call include, but are not limited to, whether field testing and sales of ClearSign's products will be successfully completed, whether ClearSign will be successful in expanding the market for its products, and other risks that are described in ClearSign's filings with the SEC, including those risks discussed under the Risk Factors section of the annual report on Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2023, and the quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2024, June 30, 2024 and September 30, 2024."",
  ""So, in exempt as required by law, ClearSign assumes no responsibility to update these forward-looking statements to reflect future events or actual outcomes, and does not intend to do so."",
  ""On the call with me today are Jim Deller, ClearSign's Chief Executive Officer; and Brent Hinds, ClearSign's Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""So, at this point in the call, I would like to turn the call over to Brent Hinds."",
  ""So, Brent, could you please go ahead."",
  "", Matthew, and  to everyone joining us here today."",
  ""Before I begin, I'd like to note that our financial results for the quarter period ended September 30, 2024 was included on our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on November 14."",
  ""And with that, I'd like to give an overview of the financials for the third quarter of 2024."",
  ""In the third quarter 2024, the company recognized approximately $1.9 million in revenues, compared to $85,000 for the same comparable period in 2023."",
  ""The year-over-year increase in revenues was driven predominantly by the shipment of multiple process burners to a California refinery customer."",
  ""And I would like to note that this quarter's revenue is the largest quarterly revenue figure ever reported by the company."",
  ""Our year-to-date revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $3 million, which is a $1.9 million increase over the prior comparable period in 2023."",
  ""This is also the largest year-to-date revenue figure reported by the company since inception."",
  ""Our year-to-date gross profit margin also increased year-over-year by 11% from 22% in 2023 to 33% in 2024, adding approximately $340,000 in profit compared to the prior period."",
  ""This profit was offset by $394,000 as a result of a one-time accrual estimate related to the decision to suspend our China operations."",
  ""Jim will give more color about our China decision and the suspension in a few moments."",
  ""Our year-to-date net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 decreased by $104,000, which is an improvement of 2.5% over the comparable period in 2023."",
  ""I need you to keep in mind that this net loss improvement includes the $394,000 from our one-time China accrual estimate."",
  ""Now, I'd like to shift our focus from the income statement to the balance sheet, more specifically cash."",
  ""Our ending cash balance for September 30, 2024 was approximately $14.5 million."",
  ""Our net cash used in operations for the quarter ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $1.4 million, compared to approximately $1.3 million for the same period in 2023."",
  ""With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our CEO, Jim Deller.""
]","[
  ""This What's also important and as Brent stated, there was 11% increase in our gross margins accompanying that revenue."",
  ""That is good, but from my perspective, I believe there is room for improvement with further volume and efficiency gains."",
  ""But overall, with the increase in revenue and margin, I truly believe the business is definitely going in the right direction."",
  ""And this speaks to the lumpiness of our revenue flows."",
  ""We have some very large significant orders but they – but the nature of that is they don't hit consistently every quarter."",
  ""So, this quarter was primarily driven by the 20 burner order that shipped out to Los Angeles."",
  ""Those burners were shipped from Zeeco out to Los Angeles refinery in California."",
  ""We were expecting them to be started up early next year."",
  ""We have learned that that will be delayed."",
  ""The clients clarified that has got nothing to do with ClearSign, but the start for those burners will now be around the middle of 2025."",
  ""So, Matt, if I can, just to comment on the order."",
  ""These burners are going into two heaters."",
  ""These are two large heaters in a very prominent refinery in the LA refining hub."",
  ""One heater is fitted with 8 burners and one is fitted with 12 burners."",
  ""And the reason I'm bringing that up, and I know it's in the middle of next year now, but when these are up and running, I really believe that these are going to be a significant reference for us."",
  ""This will be the biggest heaters we have in operation at that time."",
  ""And I believe that having that reference and this performance in that LA hub is going to be a significant catalyst for our increase in the future sales."",
  ""And I think this is relevant because it also gives us some insight into future revenue expectations as well."",
  ""So, at the time of the last call, we just announced a – in fact, the largest order we received to-date is for 26 burners going into a Fortune 500 global petrochemical company down on the US Gulf Coast."",
  ""That order is received, by the way, from a engineering and heater manufacturer called Birwelco USA."",
  ""And if you get a minute, I really encourage you to look that company up, so you'll understand the type of company we are dealing with."",
  ""The order on the Gulf Coast has some special operating requirements, but we've got the technology to do that."",
  ""And also, the recent 100% hydrogen flexible fuel burner that we have started to sell in combination with the new CFD model we've invested in have really been some big drivers between – that led to us receiving that order."",
  ""That order is going well."",
  ""And thinking of revenue, certainly when we ship those burners, it gives us some idea what to expect."",
  ""But beyond that, we also have two other orders in progress for Kern Energy."",
  ""Of course, Kern is a repeat customer for us."",
  ""Those orders are incidentally also using this flexible fuel new hydrogen burner and we're in further discussions with Kern about some other orders that we expect they're going to need next year."",
  ""So, switching from and looking at what's in-house and the revenue flow to what's driving our sales, we're seeing a lot of interest in the process burner product line across the board."",
  ""There are some drivers, Matt, as you mentioned."",
  ""The BACT review that was done by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and announced earlier in the year were significant."",
  ""For those of you who don't know, BACT is Best Available Control Technology."",
  ""It is a review of new technologies that's run in California by this – or run by all the airports in California, but administered by the South Coast Air Quality Management District."",
  ""They've reviewed two of our installations for a period of over a year with quarterly meetings and feedback."",
  ""And the result is that the performance that was documented from those installations have reset their definition of Best Available Control Technology for single burner process heaters and for multiple burner process heaters."",
  ""That is recognized throughout the industry."",
  ""We believe that is a very good validated reference for us."",
  ""Matt, if I can, also in the same period when we're talking of sales and enhancements, we conducted a burner demonstration with Zeeco back in August that went very well."",
  ""That allowed us to show our burners running in a multi-burner heater, giving lead engineers and consultants and representatives of many of the top refining and petrochemical companies the chance to look at not only at our standard burner technology, but we also, again, were able to present our new hydrogen burner technology to them."",
  ""It's really been going very well."",
  ""Zeeco has been a very solid partner for us back since 2019 when we formed the relationship."",
  ""Now, as we've increased our business, they obviously – they build all of our process burners."",
  ""They're aware of the burners we shipped, about the 20 burners that went to California shipped from Zeeco."",
  ""They're aware of the 26 burner order that we've recently received and others and aware of the quotes that are going out, because we have to schedule resources with them."",
  ""They're also aware of the hydrogen burner development we've done."",
  ""I really believe, without visibility into our growing business, we've increased our status with Zeeco."",
  ""And last week, we're able to meet with them and discuss a joint branding of a ClearSign-Zeeco process burner line."",
  ""So, intention is that Zeeco will actually start now to promote ClearSign's process burner technology under their own name and to market it and to brand it and promote it with their own global sales team."",
  ""So, we met with them."",
  ""We set a date for us to present our technology to their North American sales team and also discussed things like branding, website promotion, et cetera."",
  ""So, this is a huge development for us, one I'm very excited about."",
  ""This is a fairly new product line for us."",
  ""It's one that, I'll be honest, has spread further than we anticipated when we started it."",
  ""So, just focus on the horizontally fired process heaters."",
  ""These are small heaters often going into the midstream industry."",
  ""That's typically gas processing, but also we're finding that there are a very wide variety of different industries [Technical Difficulty] (00:15:07) that are going into."",
  ""We recently received an order, or in fact two orders, repeat orders from Exotherm going into the power generation industry as an example, those orders going into Oklahoma and Missouri."",
  ""So, expanding our national footprint."",
  ""We've also recently sold a – in fact our largest burner to date to another midstream heater manufacturer, Devco."",
  ""And the first of these midstream heaters burners were sold to another company here in Tulsa called Tulsa Heaters Midstream."",
  ""But why these are really important is not just those – the order flow rate, although that in itself is important, but the repeat inquiries and the uptick of interest and just the flow of future opportunities from them is really exciting."",
  ""And Matt, if you don't mind, let me take a step back."",
  ""So, when I joined the company in 2019 and back at that point, we laid out a strategic plan to develop ClearSign as a business, right?"",
  ""Just for everyone, the parts of that, one was focused on the technology, right?"",
  ""We had to take the technology at that time and develop that into commercial products that met the customers' needs, and that would be delivered to them in a manner that the customers were needing."",
  ""So, that led to the partnership with Zeeco because to process burners, you have to be able to deliver burners with the credentials of a company like Zeeco and access to a test furnace and from manufacturing facilities that they are willing to work with and have approved."",
  ""On the boiler burner side, right, we partnered with California Boiler."",
  ""They are the customer facing service team that actually set up Rogue to carry our product line."",
  ""But as another part of that plan, we're aware that the company is funded by investor money, we needed to keep the company asset light."",
  ""Yet, to really leverage the potential of ClearSign technology, we had to have a means to expand our sales force and get national and ultimately international reach."",
  ""And the way we plan to do that was by working through partners."",
  ""So, partners obviously like Zeeco and California Boiler where we can leverage their sales team."",
  ""And I'll refer back to the recent comments about Zeeco and why I'm so excited there."",
  ""In the midstream heaters, we're selling to heater manufacturers."",
  ""Now, those heater manufacturers are out chasing their own work, chasing their own clients with their own industry, they are using ClearSign burners with our capabilities installed in their products to make them competitive."",
  ""What it essentially means for us is that the sales teams and the marketing of these new partners, the midstream heater manufacturer in this case, become an extension of the ClearSign sales team."",
  ""So, the ultimate goal that leveraging these companies and expanding the sales reach allows us to punch above our weight and have a much greater sales outreach than we could just operating as ClearSign alone."",
  ""So, we're very much developing this business and plan to develop this business through partnerships."",
  ""So, back – I believe so, earlier this year, the results were published from a study conducted by the California GET Program."",
  ""The California GET Program is funded by the gas utility companies in California, is administered by the South Coast Air Quality Management District."",
  ""They had engaged a global consulting company called ICF to conduct third-party testing to quantify the performance of this new burner technology, ClearSign technology, compared to the other ultra-low NOx burners available in the market."",
  ""It's available through our website."",
  ""We also got a press release out with a link."",
  ""But to summarize the data, the third-party study found that a boiler fitted with ClearSign burner ran and consumed 4% less energy than the burner fitted with – or a boiler fitted with the industry standard burner."",
  ""So, to put that in meaningful terms, from mid-sized 500-horsepower boiler in California with California energy prices, that will provide a savings of about $80,000 per year to our customers, right?"",
  ""Our burners sell at a premium, but that $80,000 will more than cover that premium in a single year."",
  ""So, that in itself provides a very powerful selling proposition for ClearSign."",
  ""In addition to that, that fuel savings will equate to about 500 tons per year CO2 savings for the customer."",
  ""And the study also found or what we knew was that the ClearSign burner is capable of operating down at sub 2.5 parts per million NOx levels."",
  ""The standard industry ultra-low NOx burner was only able to run down to 6 parts per million."",
  ""We have also in progress that there's some burners due to be shipped."",
  ""There was quite a first of a series of four boilers going out to a customer in California."",
  ""That burner is built and close to being ready to ship."",
  ""We, of course, have a number of burners now up and operational."",
  ""A couple of pieces of fairly big news that's new right now, we have a very large burner installed in San Joaquin Valley area."",
  ""This has been installed and out there for a long time waiting for their construction."",
  ""We have finally got to the point that that burner, I believe, is, I'd say, about done."",
  ""It's in, it's up and running."",
  ""As of today, we have actually engaged a third-party source testing company."",
  ""These are the companies that do the formal measurements."",
  ""We've had them take our preliminary measurements for us because down at the NOx levels are running out."",
  ""The other analyzers are not all consistent."",
  ""So, we wanted to get their full spec equipment."",
  ""They've measured the performance and found that the NOx is under the guarantee level."",
  ""The final formal source testing and report is being conducted."",
  ""That's not completed yet, so we don't have the final result."",
  ""But obviously, at this point, we're optimistic that this is going to be a successful installation for us, accepted by the customer."",
  ""And when it is, I cannot emphasize how important I believe this will be for an installation."",
  ""The very large boilers operating and requiring less than 2.5 parts per million NOx was the target market."",
  ""That was the primary objective when we initially engaged with California Boiler and mutually decided to develop the product line and to market it, and to put the effort that we have to get into the California market."",
  ""So, this, I believe, is going to be a very big benchmark for the ClearSign and our brand that has the road burner... ...out in California."",
  ""I mean, in numeric terms, it's 1,200 horsepower, right?"",
  ""This in terms of just physically looking at the boiler, this boiler is going to be in the region of about 40 feet long."",
  ""It's probably as big as you could put on the back of a semi-truck, and transport across the country."",
  ""So, this is a very large boiler classified."",
  ""It's getting close to as big as fire tube boilers get before they switch over to the larger water tube and power generation boilers."",
  ""So, it's one of the biggest – it's not the biggest fire tube boiler, but it is right up there at the top end."",
  ""This is almost the perfect big boiler opportunity that people will look to and say, yes, that is a bona fide proof of the ClearSign technology."",
  ""Not so much for the – this is a standard burner for us."",
  ""The burner the client bought was just under 500 horsepower."",
  ""Of course, our 500 horsepower boiler burner model is the one that we'll use."",
  ""But it's important to talk about this, right?"",
  ""So, going back, I discussed the strategy and the vision we've laid out in 2019 and how that manifests in the boiler burner business, right?"",
  ""The process burners are necessarily bespoke."",
  ""There's unique details for every heater and no two of those are exactly the same."",
  ""That's just the way the industry is."",
  ""The boiler industry is different."",
  ""These burners are standard burners and the goal is to have a standard range of burners, the standard pricing that can allow our sales channels, in this case, Rogue Combustion, California Boiler, to go out on their own and sell this product without needing input from us."",
  ""Of course, we help with sales and marketing and strategic sales, et cetera, but the goal is to let them go hands free and just sell as many of these things as they can."",
  ""When they get an order then to turn around and just place the order with ClearSign and we have ready-made drawings and prints, we place the orders for the fabricator and they fabricate the burners."",
  ""This order – well, the reason for doing that is that gives us a highly scalable model with very little need of ClearSign resources and it empowers the sales team to go out and pursue business on their own without needing to get back for quotes or details or engineering input from ClearSign."",
  ""This order is the first of that system, right?"",
  ""It had, I don't believe, any input from ClearSign in the sales stage."",
  ""We just received a purchase order."",
  ""We turned around and placed an order on our fabricator to deliver this burner."",
  ""So, that is – it is that vision that we've laid out in 2019 actually coming through to fruition for the first time in this order."",
  ""Well, I've actually got some notes here."",
  ""So, I need – because it's formal, just to like pass the details onto everyone."",
  ""So, as you said, we filed a Form 8-K that was filed October 1 announcing that we're suspending our operations in China and putting our registered business there into a formal state of dormancy by the end of the year."",
  ""So, what that means is, we still have the business in China, but that business is basically parked and not operational."",
  ""You might think we're going into hibernation for a period until we choose to revive it."",
  ""This decision was a result of an increasingly delayed progress to gain commercial traction in China."",
  ""And as Brent said earlier, there will be some significant one-time costs."",
  ""Those are mainly related to employee termination payments."",
  ""But going forwards, our cost to maintain our business in that dormancy status will be minimal, but it also gives the ability to maintain that, right, to maintain that business registration in China."",
  ""Those are available if you look at the Form 8-K. There is more detail there for anyone wanting to see more."",
  ""This is a – like exciting areas for us."",
  ""So, we've – as you may know, we do have some flares out sold."",
  ""I believe it was 2020, I may be slightly off, but out and installed in the LA area, right, through California Boiler."",
  ""Those are up and running."",
  ""And even prior to my joining ClearSign, there were some flare technology sales."",
  ""The recent order was for, right, customizing our flare, but it's the burner element that goes into a flare."",
  ""This is for customizing our burner element to fit into an existing flare to bring it into compliance with the needs of actually a customer that has already experience of ClearSign flare technology."",
  ""That work is going well and we expect it to roll on to an equipment supply order in the reasonably near future."",
  ""I don't have an exact date for that yet, but we bring this up."",
  ""I actually want to talk about the flare industry and actually the reason that it's exciting today."",
  ""On a previous call, I've mentioned that we went to visit the government in the State of California and especially their environmental regulatory personnel as they have new emissions requirements there."",
  ""We are seeing, right, the need for different flaring technology in regions like California, in industries actually different from the standard in industries like the upstream oil industry is different industries from that as these new regulations are rolled out and as these new energy projects are seeking permits."",
  ""What that means for us is that we have a unique combustion technology."",
  ""We also have a very strong engineering capability within ClearSign and it puts us in a very strong position to actually be a solution provider for some of these new projects."",
  ""And this manifests in – there may be flares, there may be quite small thermal When we look at the long term, our plans, my plans for ClearSign, they go beyond just the burners and the technology we have today."",
  ""And a big part of that is getting into a solution provider and a systems provider."",
  ""And one of the reasons that we're particularly excited about this is it starts to dip our toe into the role of a solutions provider and putting together a bigger package that has the potential to greatly expand the sales and the revenue of ClearSign."",
  ""And I guess So, firstly, I want to reflect back on the financial numbers in the 10-Q that was filed last week and that Brent summarized earlier this afternoon."",
  ""Those had also looked back over the last 12 months."",
  ""I want to emphasize that."",
  ""I think this is a very significant development for ClearSign."",
  ""Yes, the revenue is lumpy and it will continue to be lumpy for some time."",
  ""It is also significantly more meaningful than at any time in ClearSign's history."",
  ""During the call, I referred back a few times to the strategic path we laid out in 2019 as a framework for how the ClearSign business is developing."",
  ""I do that because I think the framework is meaningful as it helps to understand how the specific items and developments that we talked about that may appear normal at face value provide the interwoven building block of a highly integrated asset-light company, and how we're growing that to have national reach and recognition and how we are growing and the importance of growing that with our partners."",
  ""So, building a network of companies, especially comprising our sales network, I can't mention all of them, but the ones that we can include by name, I just run through some key ones here."",
  ""Zeeco are key for what we do."",
  ""They've been a fantastic partner."",
  ""And again, I want to emphasize the recent developments, the conversations we've had about jointly marketing a co-branded Zeeco-ClearSign process burner."",
  ""We will keep you updated as that rolls out."",
  ""It will be a process."",
  ""I cannot emphasize how big of a step forward this is for ClearSign."",
  ""What I didn't mention in the call, just putting Zeeco in perspective, they have in the region of 2,500 employees, they've got 30 offices worldwide."",
  ""They are a true global company."",
  ""And the ability to promote our technology and to actually have Zeeco promote our technology as a Zeeco burner with ClearSign technology is – I think, has massive potential for ClearSign."",
  ""Secondly, California Boiler and Rogue Combustion, they are the customer facing and sales partner we have."",
  ""They are based in California."",
  ""They have offices and affiliates in other regions of the country, especially strong in the West Coast working with them."",
  ""Recently, had this big success."",
  ""So, we believe the big success were waiting to formalize off that very large boiler start-up, the 2.5 ppm guarantee in California."",
  ""We talked about Birwelco, and the large 26 burner order going down to the Texas Gulf Coast."",
  ""Please look at Birwelco in their website."",
  ""They are a prominent engineering company."",
  ""They work with the who's who of the refining and the petrochemical companies throughout the world, but especially in the US."",
  ""And then in the midstream heater original equipment manufacturers, I mentioned, we're now seeing a repeat flow of inquiries from Tulsa Heaters Midstream, Devco and Exotherm who gave us the repeat orders just these last few months."",
  ""So, stepping back, we aren't growing – I'm pleased to note, we've grown our installation base in California with both existing and repeat customers and we've got large installations coming, especially with the 20 burners going out to the California refinery."",
  ""We're now making headway into Texas with the larger engineering firms."",
  ""And I mentioned Birwelco and heater manufacturers and Fortune 500 customers."",
  ""There's a lot of attention on new flexible fuel hydrogen burner, and we have several projects in the execution phase utilizing this new technology."",
  ""We have a pipeline of projects to be shipped, installed and in the engineering phases, the largest we've ever had."",
  ""And we have recently had a notable developments in our boiler burner product line, just the burner in California, in the progress of our sub 2.5 ppm large boiler burner range."",
  ""And also, the California GET report giving us third-party validation of a compelling financial case for the purchase of our boiler burners."",
  ""And again, that report is available through our website."",
  ""It's also available through links from a press release we put out."",
  ""When reflecting on what we've achieved, I want us all to acknowledge that this takes more than just people showing up for work."",
  ""Our finance team, our technical and order execution teams to And at the same thought, I want to thank Zeeco from the leadership to the staff we interact with on a daily basis, and California Boiler especially for their commitment to getting – taking care of our mutual customers and getting the job done."",
  ""So, with that, I'd like to open up the call for questions."",
  ""As mentioned in the call, we saw a very significant improvement in the numbers that Brent reported."",
  ""I do believe that there is room for efficiency gains, certainly with the – from the volume we're expecting in the future as well."",
  ""So, there was an increase."",
  ""There may be a room for that increase again just looking at the mix of projects we're targeting in the future."",
  ""But we do expect – I think the key thing to emphasize is that we do expect the margins to improve even further than the improvement that Brent reported in the financials here today."",
  ""I mean, yeah, whoever asked that question, ."",
  ""That's – it's part of our business we've been very focused on the burner business in the course."",
  ""So, for those of you who don't know, Narion is a company, it's affiliated with ClearSign, but is an independent company that was set up in Seattle by an engineer that used to work for Boeing, right?"",
  ""ClearSign has not only burner technology, we have a sensing technology."",
  ""and Narion was set up to, with agreement with us, to develop applications using the ClearSign sensing technology, and especially in fields that are not core to the expertise we have at ClearSign, but to look at things like, obviously with the engineer coming from Boeing, in aerospace, transport, and a lot of other applications."",
  ""I'll expand this a little."",
  ""So, we've – right, we do have the standard burner sensors to actually a burner product line."",
  ""Narion is helping us also finalize that technology."",
  ""We believe that we're going to have like industrial installations on a demonstration basis of the pilot sensors in the, I'd say, reasonably near future."",
  ""So, Narion, they've also adapted and engaged industrial partners for a flare pilot sensing technology or a development of our sensor into flare applications."",
  ""We also expect through that work that we'll be able to get some field, at least demonstration units and hopefully commercial traction in the reasonably near future."",
  ""We're getting into the core business of Narion."",
  ""They've got a number – if you look at their website, they have a number of really interesting projects."",
  ""I think the most prominent one at this point is one feature of the ClearSign sensor is an extremely fast sensor and they have engagements to adapt that forward."",
  ""I'll describe I believe the opportunity and the potential market is huge."",
  ""But in terms of timeframe, you're going to appreciate that's projects like that and getting into technology like that do take longer to come to fruition."",
  ""So, that's going to be further out than throughout the 12 to 24 months that we're looking at for something to show from the burner and flare flame sensors."",
  ""But there's a – I'd encourage you to look at that Narion website and just see what they're doing."",
  ""We set the contract up for the work with Narion just to leverage our sensing technology, realizing there's some very big opportunities."",
  ""So, it's a win-win for them and a win-win for us."",
  ""We've hired – recently hired two new engineers."",
  ""One, Dharmik is reporting to our Chief Technology Officer; and the second, Samuel is reporting to the group headed up by Jeff Lewallen who oversees our burner business."",
  ""So, on the bottom line, the reason we brought these people in is our business is growing."",
  ""We are getting incredibly busy and we need somebody with more resources in the office to handle our growing business."",
  ""And what's really important and the reason we did this now is that both Matt Martin and Jeff Lewallen are very well-known and respected engineers in our field, are incredibly effective as customer facing and business development people."",
  ""And quite frankly, as a business, we need to get them out in front of the customers."",
  ""And as we get busy and they get consumed with more production and product development work personally, it slows them down from doing that."",
  ""So, we've went out, we've hired two great engineers."",
  ""They will give us some bench depth."",
  ""They will handle the ongoing work and really free Jeff and Matt up to focus on technology development and being out in their customer-facing role of developing our business."",
  ""So, you asked about looking forwards, right now, we do not have any open positions."",
  ""But that said, as our business grows, it is – I do expect that we will have open positions coming up to execute the orders we work and to keep our business growing."",
  ""But also, those positions will be part of the order execution."",
  ""So, if you're looking at the overhead of the company, I do not expect that to actually increase the overhead as that will be part of the costs absorbed by the projects and they'll be brought in to handle our work as our work grows."",
  ""I mean, it's grown substantially."",
  ""The orders we're getting and the people we're talking to are much more mature."",
  ""And we've seen that the, right, 26 orders going – burners going down into Texas, working with companies like Birwelco."",
  ""If you just look at, I know you can't see, but the frequency of the inquires we're getting in, we're now getting multiple inquiries a week rather than an inquiry every few weeks."",
  ""And just handling that, looking at, that's one of the key metrics that I look at internally."",
  ""It's just looking at the number of quotes we're putting out and the frequency."",
  ""And that is just constantly picking up at a very pleasing rate."",
  ""So, it's looking very promising."",
  ""I actually wish I had that calibrated crystal ball."",
  ""Look, I've been in this industry now for about 30 years."",
  ""So, I've seen multiple administrations come and go."",
  ""And typically, at the start of any administration, there's great expectations one way or the other."",
  ""And the reality is that the influence they have is significantly less than what we expect at the start of the administration."",
  ""And just the timescale of the projects and what we work with is measured in years."",
  ""So, the administration will come and go before they've had a significant effect."",
  ""Regarding the NOx emissions, they are primarily controlled by the local states."",
  ""They are based on the need to adjust ground level ozone down to standard levels that were set out many years ago."",
  ""So, we do not expect any significant change there."",
  ""I mean, from what we're hearing, there's a focus on de-carbonization."",
  ""That is a periphery to us."",
  ""We are mainly focused on NOx emissions and operating efficiency."",
  ""But also bear in mind that most of our customers are global companies."",
  ""A lot are based in Europe."",
  ""They all post their own environmental mandates and their objectives, they are on their websites and they are driving towards that."",
  ""So, I think they are self-motivated to achieve their environmental goals."",
  ""So, again, changes in the administration don't dictate the companies, the goals they set themselves, especially not when those companies have a international holding."",
  ""On the – I think on the other side, just looking forward talking to our clients, one area of encouragement maybe I don't think related to the political climate, we are seeing a increased interest in LNG, that's liquefied natural gas export and production, and we believe that there is a likely an uptick in that business next year, which will for us that's very relevant to the horizontal process burner business."",
  ""And those are the clients that I referenced earlier on today."",
  ""This is – I mean, this is probably the biggest step forward for ClearSign for a long time."",
  ""This is a, I said, so Zeeco have – the relationship we have with them has basically taken the next step forward."",
  ""In the recent developments, we are taking steps now to jointly market ClearSign products."",
  ""That gives the Zeeco sales team a product to promote that has the capabilities of ClearSign technology as a dual-branded process burner."",
  ""And the Zeeco sales team is worldwide."",
  ""They're obviously a truly a leading global company and having them promote ClearSign is a huge step forward for us."",
  ""It's what we envisioned back in 2019."",
  ""And to get to this point and having this development in that collaboration is certainly a very big deal for ClearSign."",
  ""And also from Zeeco side, they have seen what we're doing and are doing this because they believe it's a very big deal and a big opportunity for Zeeco also."",
  ""I'd like to thank everyone for your interest and taking the time to participate today."",
  ""We look forward to updating you regarding our developments and speaking with you on the next call."",
  ""In the meantime, please keep checking in for developments on our website at www.clearsign.com."",
  ""And for more behind the scenes updates, I really encourage you please to follow us on LinkedIn."",
  ""And with that, I'll say  very much and we will talk to you next quarter."",
  ""So, Jim, ClearSign just reported a record revenue quarter."",
  ""Can you give them a color – kind of a high level color on that by chance?"",
  ""And so, that revenue, as Brent mentioned, was mainly attributed to Great."",
  ""Well, let's continue with the process burner line."",
  ""We'd like to – can you give us more color kind of on the pipeline and outlook?"",
  ""I think when we left off last call, there was another large order that actually fell into this quarter, but maybe start off with – start off from there, kind of talk about that... ...other order."",
  ""And then, so earlier this year too, Jim, there was the BACT designation."",
  ""And maybe kind of address that again, what is BACT and are you seeing that helping to drive business our direction?"",
  ""And that was done at the Zeeco facilities, correct?"",
  ""So, speaking of Zeeco, how is that relationship going?"",
  ""Well, that is great news."",
  ""And I think it's the development that many of us have been waiting for."",
  ""So, from here, let's shift, if we could, Jim, to the horizontal process applications."",
  ""And this also seems like an area of business that's getting quite a bit of traction."",
  ""Would you mind giving us more color on what you're seeing in the horizontal process applications?"",
  ""So, that actually brings up another question, Jim, kind of regarding sales channels or channel partners."",
  ""It seems to be a growing part of the ClearSign story."",
  ""How do you see this continuing to roll out and kind of present business opportunities for ClearSign?"",
  ""Jim,  for the color there."",
  ""You did mention the boiler burner."",
  ""So, can we shift to the boiler burner product line now?"",
  ""There were some recent developments and announcements regarding some very kind of important third-party testing."",
  ""Now, would you mind just giving a little bit more explanation on that?"",
  ""So, that's a compelling data."",
  ""So, with that, can you give us an update on kind of the project pipeline in boiler burners?"",
  ""And when we... When we say large, can you just quantify how large?"",
  ""So, a notable demonstration of our technology?"",
  ""So, we also announced a sale of a boiler last week, and didn't know – for an asphalt company and didn't know if you wanted to just give a little color on that sale."",
  ""Jim,  for the detail."",
  ""It sounds like things are kind of starting to hum along."",
  ""To round out the boiler burner line, just last month, there was a filing regarding the China operation and Brent alluded to this in his financial overview."",
  ""I don't know if you could just kind of touch base on this."",
  "" for the update there."",
  ""And then, just weeks ago, there was an announcement regarding a flare."",
  ""So, it's the product line that we haven't heard from or heard about for some time."",
  ""Again, can you give us some color here and talk about what you're seeing regarding this product line?"",
  ""It sounds like the ClearSign brand is getting out there, as well as a reputation as a solution provider."",
  ""One thing you mentioned, the State of California, but I think you had similar conversations, am I correct, Jim, in cities like Colorado?"",
  ""So, Jim, that covers my questions regarding the business."",
  ""So, I don't know if at this point you'd like to take a moment for a final summary and maybe some thoughts on the business going forward?"",
  ""And, Constantine, this is Matthew Salinger."",
  ""We also received quite a number of questions via email ahead of time."",
  ""So, I'm going to go ahead and start by reading off some questions here."",
  ""Jim, directionally, where do you see margins heading?"",
  ""I've got another one for you here, Jim."",
  ""During the most recent conference calls, we've not heard much about Narion, and the ClearSign Eye sensor technology."",
  ""Visiting their website, it seems like a lot is going on."",
  ""Would you be able to give some insight onto the relationship and what's going on there?"",
  ""I've noticed some new hires posted on LinkedIn."",
  ""Could you give some color on these hires?"",
  ""Secondly, do you foresee additional and are there any positions you're actively looking to fill?"",
  ""Jim, here's one from the analysts that cover us."",
  ""They unfortunately were unable to attend the call."",
  ""But, Jim, how would you describe your current pipeline compared to a year ago?"",
  ""So, there's few questions very similar to this one and I'll kind of summarize it here."",
  ""With the new administration coming to place next year, will a focus on reducing NOx emissions remain important?"",
  ""And I know you can't see the future."",
  ""And could – there's a second, and, B, and could more focus on production in the United States be beneficial for ClearSign?"",
  ""Here's another question that came in, Jim, and I think you've addressed this actually a couple of times in your comments."",
  ""But somebody is asking, could you please provide some color on the essence of the relationship with Zeeco?"",
  ""So, maybe just kind of summarize what you said earlier.""

  ""Within our largest segment, the Americas, we experienced strong consumer demand for our brand throughout the year."",
  ""Revenue in the region was up 19% compared to fiscal 2023."",
  ""We saw a noticeable return to in-person shopping at multi-brand retailers in the second half of the year."",
  ""As such, our B2B strengthened throughout the year as many of our strategic partners allocated more space to BIRKENSTOCK and experienced very strong back-to-school sell-through."",
  ""We have emerged as a must carry brand within our strategic retailers."",
  ""We believe that significant reach with both store count and social media impressions have amplified our consumer demand beyond what we may achieve on our own."",
  ""In the Americas, While both closed-toe and sandals grew at double digits for the year, closed-toe grew at over 2.5 times faster than sandals, driving ASP higher."",
  ""We have gained shelf space in strategic retail partners and our brand awareness increased an average of 400 basis points in the key markets since we began our transformation in 2022."",

  ""In our fiscal years up to and including 2024, our three reporting segments were the Americas, Europe and APMA, which was comprised of two operating segments, Asia Pacific and Middle East, Africa, and India."",

  ""While the India region has been merged with the Asia Pacific operating segment to create a new segment, APAC, which will continue under the leadership of Klaus Baumann."",
  ""The change was due to the operational advantages and complementary benefits between the regions."",
  ""No changes were made to the composition of the Americas operating segment."",

  ""Prior to the release of our first quarter 2025 results, we will issue a 6-K with the 2024 quarters and fiscal year and the full fiscal year 2023 recast under the new segment reporting structure to aid in your year-over-year comparison."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it over to Oliver."",
  ""I'm pleased to share BIRKENSTOCK's performance in fourth quarter and full year 2024."",
  ""Again, we saw very strong growth throughout the year, which accelerated into our fiscal year end, allowing us to achieve another year of over 20% top line growth, coming in ahead of our expectations."",
  ""First, let's look at revenues."",
  ""Fourth quarter 2024 revenues were €456 million, growth of 22% in constant currency, accelerating from third quarter's growth of 19%."",
  ""B2B was up 26% and our Now, looking at gross profit."",
  ""In analyzing our fourth quarter gross profit margin, it's important to note that the prior-year quarter was impacted by several non-cash end-of-year true-up adjustments and the reclassification of logistics expenses."",
  ""Combined, these elevated Q4 2023 gross margin by approximately 450 basis points, making it not directly comparable to Q4 2024."",
  ""The adjustments did not impact EBITDA in the period."",
  ""And importantly, EBITDA margin increased 190 basis points year-over-year in the quarter."",
  ""On a reported basis, gross profit margin for fourth quarter fiscal 2024 was 59%."",
  ""The remaining 190 basis points of decline in gross margin was the result of, A, the expected under-absorption impact from new production capacity, which accounts for around 200 basis points; B, the increase in B2B share relative to the last year; and C, FX impact, all offset by some pricing initiatives."",
  ""The gross margin in Q4 2024 represents the more normalized trend."",
  ""For the full year, gross profit margin was 58.8%, down 330 basis points from full year 2023."",
  ""As expected, about 150 basis points of margin decline was the result of the temporary under-absorption costs from the added production capacity, the remaining 180 basis points from a combination of Selling and distribution expenditures were €141 million in the fourth quarter, representing 31% of revenue, down 640 basis points year-over-year due to General administration expenses were €32 million or 7% of revenue in the quarter, respectively, €101 million or 5.6% of revenue for the full year 2024, up Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 of €125 million was up 31% year-over-year, and margin of 27.4% was up 190 basis points year-over-year."",
  ""For the full year, adjusted EBITDA increased 15% to €555 million or an EBITDA margin of 30.8%, down 160 basis points year-over-year, largely as a result of the capacity expansion, but coming in ahead of our expected range of 30% to 30.5%."",
  ""Adjusted net profit of €55 million in fourth quarter was up 118% and adjusted EPS was €0.29, up 107% from a year ago."",
  ""Fiscal 2024 adjusted net profit of €240 million was up 16% from 2023."",
  ""EPS of €1.28 increased 13% year-over-year."",
  ""Let's now have a closer look at our balance sheet as of September 30, 2024."",
  ""Cash and cash equivalents were €356 million as of September 30, 2024, up from €344 million at the end of fiscal 2023."",
  ""We generated €429 million operating cash flow during 2024, up 20% year-over-year."",
  ""This was driven by the strong EBITDA growth, combined with improved working capital efficiency."",
  ""We improved our inventory to sales ratio to 35%, down from 40% in 2023."",
  ""Our DSO for fiscal 2024 remained very healthy at 23, in line with year ago, despite a slightly higher B2B mix."",
  ""During 2024, we spent €74 million in capital expenditures and made net repayments of €662 million in outstanding loans."",
  ""Our net leverage was 1.8 times as of September 30, 2024, below our stated target of 2.0 times."",
  ""As we look forward to fiscal 2025, we believe we are well-positioned to meet our stated growth and profitability objectives."",
  ""Our outlook for 2025 is in line with our medium to long-term targets."",
  ""We expect revenue growth of 15% to 17% with balanced and healthy growth from both Gross margin should improve year-over-year as we increase utilization and efficiency at our production facilities, moving closer to our 60% target."",
  ""We expect EBITDA margin in the range of 30.8% to 31.3%, an increase of up to 50 basis points compared with 2024."",
  ""Our effective tax rate is projected to be around 30%."",
  ""We expect to invest approximately €80 million in capital expenditures in 2025, primarily related to production capacity and retail store expansion."",
  ""We plan to use excess cash to continue reducing our outstanding debt."",
  ""Our target leverage ratio for the end of fiscal 2025 is approximately 1.5 times."",
  ""Now, I'm happy to hand over back to Oliver.""
]","[
  "" and congrats on another nice quarter."",
  ""So, Oliver, you cited 15% to 17% growth as the right pace for a healthy long-term business."",
  ""I guess, why do you think that's the right pace going forward or any structural change in drivers relative to the past decade of 20%-plus growth?"",
  ""And just near term, could you give us some color on what you're seeing in the first quarter relative to that 15% to 17% pace as you are cycling the toughest compare at 26% growth a year ago?"",
  ""Oliver, can you give a little bit more color on 1Q just how DTC versus B2B is performing, and how are you thinking about B2B versus DTC in F 2025 overall?"",
  ""How are you planning the business around that 15% to 17% in each of those segments?"",
  ""And then, can you maybe talk about gross margin by quarter, assuming 1Q is not up year-over-year, but just wondering when you're looking for gross margin to inflect positive?"",
  ""And then, Erik, maybe any color on the gross margin?"",
  "" for the detail there."",
  ""Let me keep going on the gross margin and how we should think about going forward into 2025."",
  ""Are there any other unusual items we need to think about as we look out at the quarterly trends?"",
  ""I know there was a big reclassification in 4Q as we roll into 1Q, 2Q. Is that an appropriate baseline to think about a year ago?"",
  ""And then, on revenues, I guess, to double click a little bit."",
  "" for the color on first quarter."",
  ""You mentioned the tough compares in the quarter."",
  ""But obviously, the And then finally on SG&A, I'm just curious if you could speak to the cadence of spend this year."",
  ""It hasn't really aligned very closely with revenue growth in the past and can have a pretty material difference on earnings quarter-to-quarter."",
  ""It started growing in the mid-20s last year and ended the year much, much lower."",
  ""So I'm curious, does SG&A snap back to mid- to high-teens in the first half or is it best to think about it as like a high-single digit growth rate in the first half and it accelerates with revenues through the year?"",
  ""As you think about, I believe, the pairs were up 14% this year, ASP up around 8% this year."",
  ""How are you thinking of that going forward, especially given the production capacity that's coming more online?"",
  ""What are you looking at?"",
  ""And it also sounds like the traffic in stores, did it continue to accelerate in the current quarter?"",
  ""What are you seeing, given the increased penetration of stores and the new store openings?"",
  ""And just anything more on wholesale in the Americas, what you're seeing on order trends?"",
  ""Is it still more from existing accounts or are there new ones, too?"",
  "" very much for taking my question."",
  ""I wanted to ask a three-part question, if I may."",
  ""Last year, for fiscal year 2024, you opened 20 stores."",
  ""How many stores should we assume for this year, and should it be really weighted to Asia?"",
  ""That kind of leads us to the second question."",
  ""I think, Oliver, you mentioned China is only 15% of your APMA region, so about €30 million."",
  ""But can you talk about the positioning of the brand in China and what you think is the longer-term opportunity?"",
  ""And then lastly, you mentioned that the closed-toe offering was roughly a third of the business."",
  ""Where do you think that goes for FY 2025 and longer term?"",
  ""And on closed-toe offering, where do you think that goes for this year and over time?"",
  ""Just to unpack closed-toe a little more, can you give us some – a little flavor on the drivers within that category?"",
  ""Is that the Boston just getting a lot more breadth in the assortment that's driving a lot of that?"",
  ""Are there other kind of views that are kind of driving?"",
  ""Can you give us a little more flavor of what's driving closed-toe?"",
  ""And again, do you think that, that could approach 40%, 50% of the mix going forward?"",
  ""And lastly, what is the difference in ASP on average of closed-toed versus sandal?"",
  ""Can I ask one more follow-up, maybe more for Erik?"",
  ""In an effort to help us properly calibrate our thoughts between DTC and B2B, recognizing that in the first half of 2024, DTC led B2B, but in the back half, B2B led DTC."",
  ""In the 15% to 17% guide, can you just give us some maybe qualified – do you think B2B is higher in growth than DTC, at least for the first half or for the whole year?"",
  ""Just give us just any kind of flavor you can give us between the channels and how they should grow relative to the 15% to 17%, either higher or lower would be super helpful?"",
  ""I just wanted to step back and talk about the APMA region over the longer term."",
  ""What percentage of sales do you think it could grow to over time?"",
  ""And can you just talk about your progress on putting the distribution and partnerships in place for continued outsized growth?"",
  ""I was just hoping for an update on your progress on building the partnerships and distribution that you need to continue that growth."",
  ""And hope you and your families have very happy holidays."",
  ""Erik or Alexander, just as we think about the model that we can see from the outside, are you comfortable that we're past the restatements, regional P&L, etcetera?"",
  ""And then just higher level, really great revenue, guys."",
  ""Can you share some thoughts on how you're thinking about promotional environment at large maybe with competition versus what you're seeing for you guys?"",
  ""And then just maybe speak to the That's really great and really helpful."",
  ""And then just Erik, any way to think about when Pasewalk, as we ramp – we work through that ramp and it starts becoming a benefit to the line item?"",
  ""Best of luck for the year ahead."",
  "" for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter and year."",
  ""I wanted to ask about pricing."",
  ""It looks like price accounted for about half of the 8% ASP increase in 2024, call it 4%."",
  ""Is that a good way to think about 2025 as well?"",
  ""And a similar question on mix, that was also a big driver, just should we expect much of a change there for 2025?"",
  "" for taking my questions and happy holidays."",
  ""I just want to dig into the DTC business a little bit more, especially in Americas but in total."",
  ""When – in the Americas, the DTC business represents probably around 40-plus-percent of the sales and of that, 90% – over 90% is digital."",
  ""Will most of the DTC growth that happens in fiscal 2025 happen out of Asia and Europe ex the stores and is – and then those stores that open later, drive incrementality, is that the way to think about it?"",
  ""And what would you call a mature digital penetration, I guess, in total?"",
  ""Is that like going to be a tough number to get ahead of higher than digitally and you really just need these store – you need to just open the stores and have them really start producing and I guess over the long term – you can open 30-plus stores this year, in the long term, how many stores do you foresee – own stores do foresee globally?"",
  ""And a subtle dig to your other companies, David."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Just want to get more color on what you're seeing from a customer lens."",
  ""Is there any change you're seeing in either repeat purchase behavior or number of pairs owned?"",
  ""And also curious what you're seeing in terms of the customer demographic, are you seeing younger audience or just curious what you're seeing there?"",
  "" for the color and best of luck."",
  ""Wanted to ask on cash flow and capital allocation."",
  ""The 1.5 times net leverage guide at the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA implies just modest improvement in the net debt."",
  ""Can you talk about free cash flow objectives?"",
  ""Is there some sort of offset to cash generation in the working capital lines or does that imply some use of cash such as share repurchases?"",
  ""Erik, at the midpoint of the EBITDA guide, 1.5 times net leverage guide implies like €980 million in net debt at year-end."",
  ""That's just €25 million or so better than fiscal 2024 year-end."",
  ""What are you thinking in terms of free cash flow?"",
  ""You've given us the CapEx."",
  ""I'm curious, is there some sort of offset that's impeding the progress on the net debt?"",
  "" for taking my question and congrats on a great year."",
  ""I just wanted to come back on APAC to understand if – what are the P&L implications of APAC?"",
  ""Is it gross margin accretive?"",
  ""Is it operating margin dilutive?"",
  ""And just maybe it's anecdotal, but moving from APMA to APAC, is that linked to particular managers or particular synergies by grouping regions or countries together in a different manner than in the past?"",
  ""And just to check, I think you said China was a mid-teens contribution to APMA sales, so that's about 2%."",
  ""Is that Mainland China or is that Greater China?"",
  ""You talked a lot about closed-toed shoes and some of the newer products."",
  ""Can you just talk about your injection molded sandals business and how that performed in 4Q and what you expect to see in that business next year?"",
  ""I'll just stick to one."",
  ""I'll just follow-up on the manufacturing that you just mentioned."",
  ""In terms of your investments and the factory expansion plans, how are they progressing versus your expectation and how do you expect the additional supply to evolve over the next two to three years?"",
  ""Based on the overall demand we see, we can definitely grow faster."",
  ""But again, we have to think about our whole business for the next decade, not in quarters or years."",
  ""We have to plan mindfully, that's the core of our business here."",
  ""And remember, we are 100% vertically integrated."",
  ""So, we have to think about hiring people, sourcing raw material, investing in production, and we take the responsibility and wellbeing for over 6,000 employees globally."",
  ""It's very serious for us."",
  ""So, quality means for us not only the quality standards."",
  ""Also, in production, engineered distribution, it's a very qualitatively driven sales organization we are writing."",
  ""So, it's – quality comes through different layers, raw materials, all of it."",
  ""And just as a comparison, if you grow mid- to high-teens a year, that means you're doubling your business roughly every five years."",
  ""And if you think about the whole situation in BIRKENSTOCK, doubling the output of this organization in a five years' timeframe, that's a very, very strong growth story."",
  ""And this is how we operate as a company."",
  ""And that's why we committed to the mid- and high-teens growth during the IPO."",
  ""And we think this is the right pace for sustainable long-term growth."",
  ""And yes, you mentioned the 20%-plus, the 20%-plus was the track record for the last year."",
  ""And again, there will be periods where we can and will grow faster."",
  ""But it's just – if we feel it's right for our core make-up or our core value, then we will do this, absolutely, okay?"",
  ""And regarding Q1, we're seeing, globally, a very strong holiday season."",
  ""Given what we've seen thus in Q1, we feel very comfortable that Q1 will likely come in the higher end of our 15% to 17% annual revenue growth guidance range, even against the strong comps last year."",
  ""Remember, last year, there was like a 26% growth."",
  ""So we do think that ending up at the higher end of our guidance range will be a strong signal for the brand and the global demand, which is definitely outstripping our supply here."",
  ""So, I think it's important for you to understand – it's Oliver again, sorry – that APMA region is – we're not only focusing on China, okay."",
  ""So, we really try to control the growth in a mindful way, and say, okay, double the speed, aggressive – compared to the rest of the world, that's a good speed for us."",
  ""We try to establish a very strong Southeast Asian business, we have a very strong business in Australia, strong business in Japan where especially our own retail is catching up very, very positive and very, very – very good."",
  ""And, of course, China as a main focus for a lot of investors."",
  ""But we try to balance everything moving forward."",
  ""So don't expect crazy stuff from us in these regions, because keep in mind, if political situation changed, we – you will ask the questions exactly the other way around."",
  ""So mindful way moving forward, double the speed."",
  ""We grow in this region over 40%."",
  ""So I would say, that's a pretty nice speed in this area."",
  ""And – but don't over – don't override this."",
  ""It's really it's important and it's – but it's even more important to keep it balanced."",
  ""You're talking about the PU segment, the outdoor water-ready sandals?"",
  ""We are just working on this new segment."",
  ""Actually, it was invented to cover the more humidity tropical conditions around Southeast Asia and the APMA region in total."",
  ""All of a sudden, in the US, the outdoor segment and in Europe, this slides performed pretty good."",
  ""So, it's just a new category that will be rolled out globally."",
  ""There will be also coming up some collaboration styles and some special make-ups in some areas where we push and introduce these new wearing occasions in the, let's say, soft hiking, outdoor-ish, water-ready environment."",
  ""You may see some of it inHey, Paul."",
  ""I'm taking the first one on DTC and B2B growth and going forward."",
  ""So what we will see is definitely, we'll continue to see a balanced growth between DTC and B2B throughout fiscal 2025, certainly with some nuances from quarter-to-quarter as some quarters are more sell-in and some quarters are more sell-through driven."",
  ""Please be reminded that online represents 90% of our DTC currently."",
  ""So, in other words, retail is just presenting 10% of our DTC, and we've been executing our retail expansion plan with great success."",
  ""Recently opened stores are performing really well, and they are performing well from day one."",
  ""Paris, Le Marais that opened in Q4 is our top performing store in Europe."",
  ""Chengdu store is welcoming 4,000 visitors every week, outperforming our expectations, and then Austin store is also really outperforming our expectations."",
  ""Please be assured we have secured more locations – more exciting locations to open this fiscal year."",
  ""So, you'll hear us more talking about retail expansion and you'll see retail gaining more weight in our DTC channel."",
  ""Our overview on channel growth is that we want to fulfill demand where it occurs, while we really remain disciplined in our distribution for B2B. As you know, 90% of growth is really coming from existing wholesale partners."",
  ""What they do is they expand our offering."",
  ""They offer more shelf space and they go with a wider offering to their consumers."",
  ""So, this gives us a broader reach to consumers with a broader assortment and let consumers enjoy the full breadth of our brand."",
  ""We remain disciplined in our distribution for B2B, and this is a high quality and profitable growth with a full-price realization that is superior to any other brand out there."",
  ""Sorry, I didn't get the question in the beginning."",
  ""Gross margin, if you look at Q4, the gross margin last year had a number of non-cash out-of-period accounting true-ups that impacted the quarterly margin comparisons."",
  ""So, these totaled about 450 basis points, of which the majority was related to a true-up of internal logistic expenses for the year that were reclassified between COGS and selling and distribution expenses."",
  ""There was no impact on the full year gross margin and even more important, no impact at all on the EBITDA."",
  ""So this is why we should look at the quarterly trends for gross margin, EBITDA margin 2024 as a guide for 2025."",
  ""And while, as you know, we will not be giving quarterly margin guidance overall, we have said we expect a modest improvement in gross margin for 2025 and EBITDA will go up 50 basis points higher next year."",
  ""I will take the first and the third part of your question."",
  ""And with our numbers in 2024, the quarterly cadence, we are quite confident that this is a good basis to model the 2025 quarters."",
  ""So, 2024 is completely clean."",
  ""There's no hiccups, no unusual items you need to know about."",
  ""And, of course, we have some seasonality."",
  ""I'm sure you are aware of that, especially with the higher And then, maybe just one last remark on gross margin."",
  ""Erik mentioned that we are seeing a slight uptrend of the margin in 2025."",
  ""This will likely to happen in the back half of the year."",
  ""Well, on the SG&A, it's the same cadence and also a good starting point for the 2025 quarters."",
  ""There are fluctuations, but this is just pure seasonality and depending on the channel mix, but SG&A is also a good starting point, taking the 2024 numbers."",
  ""I'm going to take the first part of the question and then I'll hand over to my esteemed colleague, David, to give us some color on the Americas piece."",
  ""So, on units versus ASP growth, we definitely see volume being a bigger driver of growth than previous years."",
  ""As you know, finally, we have the capacity to really unlock whitespace categories such as the APMA or now APAC region, our closed-toe product category, but also other business areas such as professional."",
  ""These are all incremental fields of play to our unit growth."",
  ""Further to that, this increased capacity is also benefiting our B2B business."",
  ""It really allows us to gain shelf space with existing partners that are widening their assortment and offering."",
  ""Even with that high unit growth, we expect a positive ASP contribution to revenue growth driven by mix predominantly, but also like-for-like pricing going forward."",
  ""Dana, hey, this is David."",
  ""Just to follow up on the back half of that question."",
  ""As you've heard repeatedly from us, 90% of our growth in revenue comes from not only existing accounts, but existing doors."",
  ""So, that shows that we're getting increased shelf space, increased penetration, increased spread in our collection, mainly in our current points of distribution."",
  ""The only new points of distribution would be ones that are very, very tactical and strategic."",
  ""For us, we've spoken about this previously, but most specifically related to sport specialty where we've, over the last year, established a nice, small basis, but very, very disciplined growth in that specific channel."",
  ""I'm going to do the first part of it, which is stores related, then I'm going to hand over to Klaus for the Asia piece."",
  ""As you know, retail is a massive growth pillar for us."",
  ""We are currently operating 67 stores, adding – and have added 20 stores in 2024."",
  ""We have plans to open more."",
  ""We are very disciplined in regards of locations that we go after, but also our return requirements."",
  ""Cash payback on investment is, as you know, within 18 months."",
  ""So, yes, we do expand, but we also expand very consciously, if you will."",
  ""Our aim for fiscal 2025 is to increase the door fleet by 50%."",
  ""So that's a significant growth of our door fleet."",
  ""And as I said, every store that is opened is performing and has to perform really well from day one."",
  ""So you see us having some really exciting locations lined up."",
  ""We just opened in Europe."",
  ""As I said, Paris is a very, very great success story in Europe."",
  ""And so, there are many others in the other regions."",
  ""So more to come on that."",
  ""Klaus here, answering the China question."",
  ""First of all, it's important to know that we are not new in China."",
  ""I mean, we have a long history there."",
  ""And, yes, we are accelerating now our growth."",
  ""As you know, we signed up a partner for our B2B mono store development and we are delivering now to six point of sales, and we are operating two owned stores."",
  ""On the digital side, we opened social sales channels as TikTok and the WeChat program."",
  ""So, looking forward, I mean, we will keep this pace and Yeah."",
  ""So this is Nico again."",
  ""So, closed-toe offering, as you know, is now a third of our business and it continues to grow at the pace of more than twice as fast as our sandals."",
  ""Important to know that sandals is growing double digits, so we grow both areas of the business, while closed-toe is over-performing."",
  ""We haven't set ourselves a target for this one, but you will see an increased share of closed-toe business going forward."",
  ""First off, there's no copy and paste globally on closed-toe."",
  ""The beauty of the business is closed-toe encompasses everything from clogs to boots, and we're seeing positive momentum across every element of closed-toe."",
  ""In the US specifically, it has been driven by clogs."",
  ""The beauty of that is it's not just the Boston, it's also the Tokyo."",
  ""There's a new clog called the Lutry with a convertible strap that you may have seen out at retail that's selling very, very well."",
  ""And the impact of clogs actually is even spilling over to our Zermatt slipper, which has been in the line for five to six years, and because of the interest in clogs, is now having its best season in its entire history."",
  ""Obviously, from an ASP , David."",
  ""So, maybe you remember our Q1 last fiscal year, fiscal year 2024 where we saw a very, very strong success of launched boots silhouettes."",
  ""In fact, 4 out of top 10 in DTC, the top 10 sellers were laced-up shoes."",
  ""And we launched the HIGHWOOD and the PRESCOTT at a price point of €200 – above €200 and those styles really performed very well."",
  ""So, as you can see, we are spearheading not just closed-toe, but also boots and laced-up shoes in our DTC business."",
  ""And what we do is we take the great learnings and the great success into our B2B business."",
  ""And Autumn-Winter 2024 is the season that we are selling through now with our partners, was the first season where we doubled the order intake for laced-up shoes."",
  ""And for us, it was quite significant to do that because we shared the great success of our DTC and asked our partners to broaden the range with us and invest into that part of the collection."",
  ""Now, the sell-through now of exactly that order intake is doing really positive."",
  ""So, we see a continuation of the trend of last Q1, with again laced-up shoes and boots really performing well and over-performing against the rest of the business."",
  "" Hey, can you hear us?"",
  ""We dropped out by chance."",
  ""It wasn't because of the question."",
  ""So, we didn't break it down in detail, as you know, but it's moderate growth in all areas."",
  ""So it's a balanced growth to whatever the demand is asking for."",
  ""And as we have, I think, discussed in the past, the B2B business is as positive for us as This is Megan."",
  ""I just want to follow-up there also."",
  ""Just a reminder that 40% of our business is already On the Hello."",
  ""I think we are planning to grow about 30% share."",
  ""So, we are balancing out in the region."",
  ""In the growth cadence, we like to say that the APMA region should have a double speed of our mature markets."",
  ""And can you repeat the second question, please?"",
  ""As you know, we signed up a partner for China."",
  ""We are also very much focused on our That sounded like more than one question, but , Simeon."",
  ""So, let me start with your comment regarding the P&L. It's very clear it's not a restatement."",
  ""It's a reclassification of internal logistic costs, which can be shown in sales and distribution and it can be shown in COGS and some companies do like this."",
  ""So, we sort of cleaned it up from 2023 Yeah."",
  ""I think on the question about the general promotional environment, I think what you're seeing is this bifurcation out there."",
  ""A lot is promoted, but the few things that people really demand, that they're intentionally shopping for are selling through at full price."",
  ""We're very fortunate that we are one of those brands."",
  ""As you know, we manage scarcity with such a high level of discipline that the amount of hash, which is our – which is the industry term for broken sizes, at any given time, is mathematically quite small."",
  ""Having said that, when you have a very developed digital business where you do carry a broad assortment, you are going to see what may be more breadth, but certainly a very, very low depth in any given style."",
  ""So specifically to the US, who I know you're referencing, with MAP pricing, we manage wholesale so tight, our retailers experience in-season well over 95% full price realization."",
  ""On our own Hey, Simeon, this is Alexander."",
  ""I will take that over."",
  ""Yeah,  for that part."",
  ""Overall, we are absolutely pleased with how well the expansion has gone so far, not only in our new factory in Pasewalk, but also in the existing build-out in Görlitz and in Portugal."",
  ""So the expansionary steps we did in 2023 and 2024 have been the foundation of our unit growth."",
  ""I think that's also important to mention in every single situation that it's not only pressure to margin, it gives us the opportunity to substantially grow in units."",
  ""And this was clearly a drag, especially in 2024 as expected and communicated upfront."",
  ""This was a peak year of the margin pressure and with that transitionary year we are now going into a 2025 year where we will see a better absorption as discussed already primarily in the back half of the year and we will also confirm that we expect a full absorption of fixed cost in the third quarter of 2026."",
  "" for the question, and you're absolutely right."",
  ""So, when you are looking into 2025, I think Nico mentioned also that we are expecting approximately two-thirds unit growth, approximately one-third in ASP growth."",
  ""And yes, ASP is primarily driven by like-for-like pricing and product mix, with consumers continuously buying more into higher price points and premium products."",
  ""We mentioned closed-toes as an example here."",
  ""So, higher level share but also product embellishments are supporting this trend, and this will continue into the future retail we'll have on the channel expansion, but overall in 2025, we are not expecting a major influence on ASP from a channel mix."",
  ""Take that one, I guess."",
  ""Obviously, we don't – we're not providing by channel, by region, but I think to your – to get to your question, yes, you're right on the Sam, hey."",
  ""First off, we're going to increase our door count, physical doors by 50% in 2025."",
  ""So, that's pretty aggressive as far as new door openings."",
  ""I would say – and again, it's a little bit mathematical, it's a little bit anecdotal, but I would say once you get to a 40% digital penetration in a market that becomes pretty much optimized."",
  ""It doesn't mean it's not going to grow, it will grow in revenue dollars, but as far as share of business, it may be slightly above 40%, about optimized where it is and I think we've learned over the last few years from other brands, once you try to lean into one channel versus the other, it may not serve the purpose that you're seeking it to actually serve."",
  ""So, I think we have a pretty optimal balance around the world that might play out a little different by region."",
  ""It might play out a little different by quarter."",
  ""But I would say that we have the most healthy balance in the market right now."",
  ""And as we open more retail stores and more physical touchpoints with that brand, that's going to be purely incremental Hey."",
  ""So, in regard of repeat purchases, we do have a very strong build-up of our membership base, currently 8 million members."",
  ""There you use your imagination how fast this can still grow."",
  ""It's growing – has been growing 30% year-on-year with already now members spending 30% than non-members."",
  ""So what we also typically see with members is they sort of transcend into other categories with us, let's say, more expensive categories, but also newer categories such as shoes, lace-up shoes, insole business that is typically adopted much faster than – with members than with non-members."",
  ""We've done a great job in becoming clearer on our member segments."",
  ""So, you'll see us becoming more personal in how we treat our members and more exclusive."",
  ""We have a very, very large amount of product that is exclusively meant for members that is displayed online, and that also typically sells through much, much faster than the rest of the line."",
  ""So, yes, a very healthy growth in membership, a very healthy business with members, but yet to be growing significantly."",
  ""Going forward the plan is much the same as it was this year."",
  ""First of all, invest in the business."",
  ""So, if something is needed, if we think it helps the business, we will do it."",
  ""And around €80 million is the plan for current year."",
  ""Afterwards, continue to pay down our debt."",
  ""We expect, as I said, 1.5 times leverage end of the year, eventually pay off the US term loan and everything after this will be decision made by the board, obviously."",
  ""But the strength of our business and the very strong cash flow conversion shows that we are on the right way."",
  ""Of course, we have to be free on this and we just want to be capable of investing in whatever is needed, either build-up inventory or invest into the CapEx."",
  ""Yes, for me personally, US term loan is the first priority because it's the most expensive one."",
  ""It's around $170 million plus, as you know, there's another euro term loan debt, bond and everything else will be decided by the board afterwards."",
  ""I'll take the first part and then hand over to Nico."",
  ""So, to keep it simple, on the margin side, with that share of business of your – of course, you don't get the full leverage if you compare that to a much more bigger business, but we have really nice price points in the regions."",
  ""Some markets are already quite developed, and we expect in the mid to long term no margin pressure from making that region bigger."",
  ""So, it's – so, definitely supporting that margin, but in some markets, to be fair, when starting that up and ramping, you don't have the full profitability in year one or year two, but this is fully built into our plan."",
  ""Just on the segment change, yes, we decided to realign our segment structure into Americas, EMEA and APAC."",
  ""Basically, the decision has been taken because we see structural similarities, but also operational advantages between Europe and Middle East, Africa, but also India and APAC."",
  ""So Asia Pacific with India stays under the leadership of Klaus Baumann in the new APAC segment."",
  ""Then, I will take care responsibility of the EMEA segment."",
  ""We've just started in Q1 to execute in this new segment formation and would provide all financials and This is Greater China."",
  ""I think we touched on that question earlier in the call, but let me just wrap up that here's everything on plan, not only in the new factory, also the other two we are building out and this is not a plan which is done in 6 or 12 months, we started in 2022 and this will last until 2026, especially building out Görlitz."",
  ""This is absolutely on what we expected so far."",
  ""The drag on margin is nothing what will continue in 2025 and 2026."",
  ""So for now, all good here.""

12,3133920,05JHLS-E,2024-11-24,"[
  ""It's 10 o'clock, so we'll get things underway."",
  "" for taking the time to join the call today."",
  ""So, I've got Aaron Saunders, our Group CFO, with me."",
  ""And my name is Todd Hunter, the Group CEO."",
  ""So we'll go through the half year results and then we'll open up for Q&A at the end."",
  ""So we'll run this like we normally do."",
  ""You can either type a question into the Q&A section of the Team's webinar, or you can raise your hand."",
  ""And I can just unmute you to ask your question, so you can do it either way."",
  ""Prefer the unmuting, this can make things flow a bit easier, but we'll get to that shortly."",
  ""So we'll go do a quick overview of first half and Aaron is going to take us through the financials."",
  ""He'll hand back to me for the segment results and then a couple of comments about the outlook."",
  ""We're very pleased with the first six months just completed, another record result for the business."",
  ""And, yeah, definitely highlights the consistent and stable earnings that we're able to generate from Turners Automotive Group."",
  ""And I think growing earnings despite the challenging macro is an outstanding result."",
  ""As you will have noticed, the earnings composition has changed and we fully expected it would with the economy deteriorating further."",
  ""Auto Retail profits are down and the Finance profits are up to compensate that."",
  ""There's definitely been some pressure on used car pricing with lower demand."",
  ""However, we've seen pricing stabilize and strengthen in more recent months."",
  ""We feel we're well on track to beating our NZD 50 million profit target for the full year and, in line with this, expect to pay a dividend of at least NZD 0.27 per share."",
  ""Since the annual meeting in September, we've received further third party endorsement of how successful the Tina from Turners brand campaign has been."",
  ""And we've also made the three finalists in the Company of the Year category and the Deloitte Top 200 Awards, which we're very proud to be part of that small group."",
  ""Couple of slides now just on the used car market."",
  ""Whilst used car transactions are holding up okay at a total level, we feel like this masks a few changes."",
  ""Used import registrations are down 14% year-on-year and really reflect the lower number of cars coming into the country."",
  ""And we've continued to see demand strengthen at those lower price point segments."",
  ""I think this is also a sort of pertinent time to remind everyone that used cars remain much less sensitive to the economic cycles as opposed to new cars, which tend to be far more discretionary."",
  ""This graph really highlights quite starkly the difference between those two segments."",
  ""And we continue to enjoy global leading levels of team engagement, which is great to see."",
  ""You would have heard from us a lot that we put a considerable amount of effort into this right across the business."",
  ""And we do see it as one of the Turners super strengths."",
  ""And with 53% of our team owning shares in Turners, that really turbocharges the effort and energy that our people put into our business."",
  ""I'll just hand over to Aaron now to take you through the financial results."",
  ""We'll sort of rip through these slides reasonably quickly."",
  ""So, yeah, as Aaron was saying, Auto Retail revenue is down 6%, reflecting the lower priced cars and lower vehicle margins, and segment profit is down 18% year-on-year, as a result of that."",
  ""I think the pleasing thing is market share has continued to grow and through that first half, with BuyNow sales up 9% and wholesale auction sales up 6%."",
  ""So, that's a good result."",
  ""And we know we're building out – continuing to build our brand presence in the market."",
  ""Our finance attach rate has dropped slightly as I think credit policies have tightened, and Oxford is no exception to that."",
  ""And also, just affordability hurdles become more challenging for certain customers."",
  ""Our BuyNow units have increased nicely and pleasingly, we're seeing continued buy-in from our lease customers to channel more of their vehicles into that BuyNow channel and out of their wholesale option channel."",
  ""But still plenty of opportunity for us left in that part of our strategy."",
  ""Our vehicle sourcing capability continues to improve, and you can see obviously the first half."",
  ""This year, we've sold more owned cars than last year, which is good to see."",
  ""And we continue to acquire more cars through our local domestic channels."",
  ""And we've kind of talked about the margin impact."",
  ""So, I won't sort of cover that off."",
  ""But pleasing to see that things have started to recover from a margin perspective, which is great."",
  ""Damage and end-of-life vehicle volumes are down."",
  ""And, again, no surprise for us around that."",
  ""So, they're down 8% due to the absence of the one-off large weather event impact that we had in the first half last year."",
  ""But you can still see that there's an underlying trend here of more cars being written off from the insurers."",
  ""On construction and new branch plans, the projects in Christchurch are tracking really well."",
  ""We're on time and on budget for all three of those projects, which is great to see."",
  ""And we're continuing to see lots of property opportunity come to market."",
  ""So, we've got a number of live negotiations on new sites at the moment."",
  ""And our conviction remains strong that we want to own as many of these key strategic sites as we can, because that creates long-term value for all shareholders."",
  ""As you will remember, we've purchased 50% of My Auto Shop."",
  ""And the initial sort of eight weeks or so that we've had involved in it, business has been very productive and very positive."",
  ""So, we've grown the team by 50%."",
  ""So, we've added techs in Hamilton, Tauranga, Wellington and additional people in Auckland as well."",
  ""And I would say our confidence is really building around what we can do with My Auto Shop and the impact that it could have on the group."",
  ""So, yeah, our simple goal is to make vehicle repairs easier."",
  ""And we're just really into the opportunity now."",
  ""And the counter to the Auto result is the result in Finance."",
  ""So revenue up 11% and segment profit up 59%."",
  ""So we're starting to see signs of growth in that loan book again."",
  ""And, certainly, originations in the last couple of months have been much better."",
  ""And pleasingly, we're seeing a really strong origination in that premium customer segment."",
  ""So that's the best quality customer we can add, which is great to grow the book in that quality segment."",
  ""And it's kind of no surprise that with our focus on quality borrowers, our arrears, so they've also outperformed the broader market with the auto loan market."",
  ""And New Zealand arrear is running at 6.4%."",
  ""The red line in our book running at 2.8%."",
  ""And we also have just given you some sort of line of sight around hardships and things as well."",
  ""So, I mean, unsurprisingly, again, they've increased, but are still running at very low numbers compared to the number of active customers that we have."",
  ""So, less than 0.5% in hardship."",
  ""The average credit scores of our new customers continue to increase, reflecting the higher proportion of premium business, but also the affordability hurdles that we use to approve customers."",
  ""So we're now into our fifth year of writing new business at credit scores higher than the market average, which puts us in a very, very strong position from a quality perspective."",
  ""And the heavy lifting that we've done on pricing over the last 18 months has really paid off."",
  ""Net interest margin has stabilized and has now returned to expansion, with those rate headwinds turning into tailwinds, as Aaron was just describing."",
  ""But we would expect the pace of recovery and NIM to be slower than the pace at which it came down."",
  ""But good it's coming – good to see the net interest margin starting to increase."",
  ""One of the other things that we're really pleased about is the operating leverage that we've created in Oxford."",
  ""And the team have done a huge amount of work on our loan approvals, systems and processes, resulting in much higher levels of auto approval."",
  ""And the higher the level of auto approval, the much higher conversion to having that loan application paid out In Insurance, we've seen revenue growth of 4% and profits up 8% in the first half."",
  ""Gross written premium is being flat half-on-half and earned premium up slightly."",
  ""Our risk pricing is becoming more layered, leading to improved claims ratios and just improving the overall quality of the portfolio, making sure that we're getting the right reward for the risk that we take."",
  ""I think I wanted to call out the shining light of growth as the comprehensive motor vehicle insurance portfolio."",
  ""So, that's a product that we resell on behalf of Vero."",
  ""So we don't underwrite comprehensive motor vehicle insurance."",
  ""We just resell the Vero product."",
  ""So the premium book now is at NZD 35 million per annum."",
  ""And it's growing at sort of circa 40% a year and it's due to the new customers that we're adding, that we have a 90% plus renewal rate on those policies."",
  ""So, yeah, it's a great business."",
  ""So we don't underwrite the risk, but we just take and earn for every policy sold and renewed."",
  ""And just one call out here, that as the interest rate cycle eases, it does become a headwind for Insurance due to the sort of NZD 60-odd million of insurance reserves that we've got invested in term deposits."",
  ""So we would expect the investment earnings that we get off that money to reduce as interest rates come down."",
  ""Claims continue to be well managed."",
  ""And as you can see from the graph on the right, claims inflation has now stabilized."",
  ""And we're – and we expect to see this kind of move down."",
  ""In Credit Management, the recovery is definitely slower than what we expected it to be."",
  ""Revenue up 2%, profit is up 2% for the half."",
  ""And although debt load is flat half-on-half, you can see that in the top graph, there's been a noticeable change in the quality."",
  ""So, we've got just under a 20% lift in our first referral debt."",
  ""So, that's debt that hasn't had another collection agency do any work on."",
  ""So, we're getting the first crack at it and, obviously, we want more of the first referral debt."",
  ""Also, the higher yielding SME debt load is up materially and debt value collected is down slightly due to lower repayment amounts and the extended terms of some of those arrangements."",
  ""We thought it was useful to just give some visibility around the number of debts that we have under payment arrangements."",
  ""So, you can see the number of payment arrangements are starting to build back to sort of towards pre-COVID levels, which is what we want to see."",
  ""But there is no doubt that affordability challenges are resulting in lower and much longer settlement arrangements to address those outstanding debts."",
  ""So now, thinking about the sort of broader market of New Zealand arrears."",
  ""So data we get from Centrix, our credit bureau, nationwide arrears still tracking above 2018 levels."",
  ""So, the highest they've been for, I think, it's eight years now."",
  ""So, that trend is expected to continue worsening over the coming months and EC Credit is certainly well positioned to assist our customers with that challenge."",
  ""We've called out a number of key challenges and risks over the last two-and-a-half years and we feel the recession risk has now decreased now that we're into the interest rate easing cycle."",
  ""And we're definitely more confident about trading conditions improving further as interest rates continue to drop over the next sort of six to nine months."",
  ""So, yeah, the risks sort of in the business have definitely reduced, we feel."",
  ""And just to wrap up with a few comments on the sort of outlook."",
  ""So, yeah, as we've talked about, we're in this build phase around branch development."",
  ""So, the next 18 months, or 12 to 18 months are really about bringing those new Christchurch sites on-stream and trying to uncover some more opportunities, which we're actively working on."",
  ""Vehicle pricing has stabilized, which is great, and certainly seeing lift in margins through the latter part of Q2 and Q3."",
  ""And our overall sales volumes are tracking very well and continue to track ahead of last year."",
  ""Finance is kind of more of the same for us."",
  ""We definitely want to keep our discipline around quality."",
  ""We see – we're seeing the expected improved performance in FY 2025 as a result of those lower than expected impairments and credit losses and improvements in interest margin."",
  ""And we're seeing growth in origination into Q3."",
  ""In Insurance, earned premium holding up really well."",
  ""Claims ratios are stable, and we have just signed a couple of new distribution arrangements."",
  ""So, one with New Zealand And from a guidance perspective, we're just reaffirming the guidance that we gave at the annual meeting in September, so that we expect to exceed our NZD 50 million profit before tax goal for the full year."",
  ""And, yeah, as Aaron outlined earlier, we'll pay at least NZD 0.27 per share in terms of the dividend."",
  "" for joining us on the call."",
  ""Results-wise, we saw a small drop in revenues, but growth in profits, with EBIT up 3% and pre-tax profit up 5%."",
  ""Earnings per share is up 2%."",
  ""And the directors have declared a fully imputed dividend of NZD 0.07 per share payable in January."",
  ""I think the interesting thing is that the market certainly changed between quarters one, two and what we're seeing now in quarter three."",
  ""And margins have continued to improve since our low point in the sort of four months between April and July."",
  ""And pleasingly for us, car sales are tracking ahead of last year and our financing arrears – arrears in our Finance business continues to perform very well."",
  ""Origination volumes are starting to lift and we were hoping that we would start to see a spring lift and that definitely seems to be materializing."",
  ""And we expect to benefit more from the easing in the OCR in the second half."",
  ""So, we are now down to NZD 20 million of, what I would call, sort of super cheap pandemic era swaps."",
  ""And they will roll off over the next eight or nine months."",
  ""Essentially, the full benefit of OCR cuts start to kick in late in this half."",
  ""In Insurance, our claims continue to track well below expectations, with gross written premium holding up well."",
  ""In EC Credit, corporate debt load is starting to recover."",
  ""SME debt load has increased very quickly, which I think is an indicator of where the pain points are in the economy at the moment."",
  ""And I think in a more general sense, credit metrics around the country are expected to be a tailwind for this business going into the second half."",
  ""Just another look at the numbers there."",
  ""From a revenue perspective, the material movement is really around auto."",
  ""So that's a drop in auto reflecting a drop in used car sales prices."",
  ""And that has been partly offset by an increase in Finance."",
  ""So, certainly, the lower consumer demand or certainly lower demand at higher price points has meant that vehicle pricing and margins have been under some pressure in the auto business."",
  ""And that is starting to alleviate itself in this third quarter."",
  ""Finance revenue growth really does reflect the repricing strategy that we've applied to that book over the last two years."",
  ""Profitability or profits have followed revenues."",
  ""Net profits are really, again, about the dip in auto margins, largely offset by increasing net interest margin in Finance and recovery in the performance of Oxford."",
  ""I guess, also last year, we had a significant boost from the weather events, that anniversary weekend weather event, and following that, Cyclone Gabrielle."",
  ""So, that certainly, I think, provided a bit of impetus to used car demand with people needing to replace vehicles at relatively short notice."",
  ""And, obviously, we haven't seen that benefit in this six-month period."",
  ""Finance net interest margin, as I noted, is expanding and originations are starting to grow off market share gains, particularly in the premium segment, which is we are targeting all our efforts in Oxford."",
  ""And in Corporate, costs have started to come down because largely our corporate debts are unhedged and so, we've been a more immediate beneficiary of those OCR drops."",
  ""The benefits of a diversified business, something we've talked about over probably the last couple of meetings."",
  ""But what it does give us are automatic or natural stabilizers in profits."",
  ""And you've seen that play out in this last six months."",
  ""So, the group is continuing to grow in what has been a very tough trading environment, probably the toughest used car trading environment that we've seen, even counting the GFC."",
  ""So the composition of earnings in this first half look different, and largely that's played out as we expected it to, with upside in Oxford and DPL Insurance, more than offsetting the pressures on margin in auto."",
  ""So, shout out to dividend growth over – well, over longer than decade now, obviously, pointed out, there was a bit of an impact from COVID in the year to March 2020."",
  ""But broadly speaking, solid growth in dividends."",
  ""Just a call out to our dividend reinvestment plan."",
  ""So that will continue to apply to this January dividend and that gives a benefit to shareholders."",
  ""They can convert new dividends into Turners shares at a discount of 2% on the average market price."",
  ""This year, we're predicting or In terms of the balance sheet, there's a couple of things to call out."",
  ""Inventory levels in auto are lower than we would like to see."",
  ""Part of that reflects quite tight supply conditions."",
  ""And the balance is our deliberate strategy to acquire lower priced cars, to meet market demand."",
  ""And I would broadly say there's a 50/50 split, and that circa NZD 8 million drop in inventory."",
  ""So half of the drop is caused by us sourcing lower value cars and half of the drop is caused by us not having quite as many cars as we'd like."",
  ""The benefits of that in terms of the balance sheet are obviously more cash, quicker stock turn, and, broadly speaking, a more efficient balance sheet."",
  ""Our target level for inventory is higher, though."",
  ""It's closer to NZD 25 million."",
  ""So you can kind of see that we are a bit light."",
  ""Finance receivables are up slightly and that's due to growth and premium lending volumes."",
  ""The priorities remain for that book, really, about rebuilding margin and quality receivables."",
  ""And the growth that drops out is we treat as a bonus essentially."",
  ""Property, plant and equipment are up due to the acquisition and development of new sites in Napier, Tauranga and Christchurch."",
  ""We finished In terms of our funding mix, we created a new securitization warehouse in September of 2023 and that facility has amortized or paid down in line with what we predicted at that time."",
  ""So, that facility is down to NZD 55-odd million by September 2024."",
  ""We're comfortable we've got capacity to support growth in Oxford over the next 6 to 12 months."",
  ""And in Corporate, we've got this committed branch expansion pipeline that is fully funded with available capacity out of the syndicate."",
  ""So, pretty comfortable with where debt levels are."",
  ""And, obviously, it's a much more enjoyable environment when interest rates are coming down."",
  ""We have about 38% of our debt floating at the moment."",
  ""So, we start to see immediate benefits as Adrian Orr gets to – gets involved in the heavy lifting of cutting interest rates back to neutral or below."",
  ""So, yeah, I look forward to seeing how that plays out over the next 6 to 12 months.""
]","[
  ""So, it's the end of the sort of formal part of the presentation."",
  ""So, I'll now open up for questions."",
  ""So, let's go to the top."",
  ""And ...sort of wholesale transition, yeah, I mean, we're sort of grinding it out."",
  ""It's probably the best way of describing it."",
  ""I mean, obviously, the percentages aren't materially moving."",
  ""We kind of – it's kind of inch by inch."",
  ""I think we've had some good progress with some of the lease customers."",
  ""You can see the bullet point here, we've shifted that BuyNow percentage of the stock from kind of 33% to 38%."",
  ""But there's also more units flowing into that wholesale channel."",
  ""So, things like finance repos."",
  ""So we do – obviously, we sell a lot of repossessed vehicles for other finance companies."",
  ""But that volume is up 100% year-on-year."",
  ""So that does not go into the BuyNow channel."",
  ""That goes into the auction channel because that needs to be run through for the market Yeah, for sure."",
  ""I think there is a massive reflection of people having – trying to buy lower priced cars."",
  ""It would be sort of – it won't be for at least 24 months."",
  ""So, sort of past that time."",
  ""It'll be kind of in that 24- to 36-month kind of timeframe."",
  ""So yeah, it's a bit of water to flow under the bridge."",
  ""But plenty of things for us to do in the meantime."",
  ""And yeah, as I said before, James, the work that's going on at the moment is feeling very productive and genuinely beneficial to both organizations, which is awesome."",
  ""Probably we're talking about the offset of the commercial sort of lending and... Pretty steady, Great."",
  ""Is there any other questions we can answer for people?"",
  ""You can either type in to the Q&A if you feel more comfortable that way, or you can raise your hand and I can unmute you."",
  ""Or you can get in touch with Aaron right after the call if you've got something that you need answered."",
  ""Well, it looks like we have exhausted the questions that people have."",
  ""So, we will leave you to get on with your day."",
  ""And if there's anything else that we can answer subsequent to those, please get in touch with us and we'll see you all soon."",
  ""Half is due to lower value vehicles, Grant, and the other half is really due to demand, weak demand, particularly in that April to July period."",
  ""The Auckland and Wellington markets have been the most affected for I think probably obvious reasons, around indebtedness, in Auckland in particular, household indebtedness."",
  ""And in Wellington, it's a combination of debt and the impact of the change of government."",
  ""So, the flip side of that is the regions have performed very strongly for us."",
  ""The South Island has been quite a standout."",
  ""So it has really been a mixed bag."",
  ""But we are expecting to see a bit of a metro recovery, with interest rate pressures on households starting to ease off a little."",
  ""I mean, we would expect that book to start growing."",
  ""Well, it is growing now."",
  ""And I don't think it's too demanding to expect 10% growth a year over the next couple of years out of that book."",
  ""So NZD 40 million to NZD 50 million a year."",
  ""I mean, there's a – the business does have some seasonality, particularly in the auto business."",
  ""December and January are almost half months because the country almost invariably shuts down for a couple or three weeks of that Christmas, New Year period."",
  ""So, typically, we have a slightly weaker second half because of that."",
  ""So, it's generally not a straight double the first half results."",
  ""And I don't expect that'll be different this year."",
  ""We're certainly expecting a better second half than the second half we had last year."",
  ""But that will be the churn of 4% to 5% similar to what we've seen in this first half, depending on how aggressive Adrian Orr is starting on Wednesday."",
  ""But broadly speaking, a bunch of things that we're – quite strong headwinds in the last sort of 12 to 18 months have become tailwinds."",
  ""So, we are very confident about the NZD 50 million target."",
  ""And you can kind of read into that what you will."",
  ""But I wouldn't express a degree of confidence in a doubling of the first half result in the second half, if you like."",
  ""I can quickly talk to sourcing, Yeah."",
  ""So, I mean – and the line we draw was around about NZD 20,000."",
  ""And in the last two months, we've kind of released some of those shackles a little bit on the branches."",
  ""So we are now much more confident buying cars in that sort of NZD 20,000 to NZD 40,000 price bracket because we've seen some green shoots of demand."",
  ""And so we've got some more confidence around supply, albeit imports are going to be a problem and a particular problem for some of our competitors because there is the floating supply in the market, if you like."",
  ""So, quite confident in our position."",
  ""Quite confident that we've kind of been through a pricing adjustment through that April to July period."",
  ""And so, inventory values dropped at that time, sort of super confident that we've come through that, in a normal kind of spring lift than pricing is playing out."",
  ""So, from a supply perspective, yeah, things seem to be a little bit easier domestically, a little bit harder from Japan is probably my summary."",
  ""They'll peak when the unemployment rate... ...peaks, I think, James, which is people are saying is probably going to be the middle of next year."",
  ""I mean, typically, arrears develop over time as a function of affordability and the biggest people had to affordability is their job."",
  ""So yeah, I'd expect they'll keep lifting until sometime around the middle of next year."",
  ""And then they could drop quite quickly, which is what we've seen over the past cycles, is credit policies adapt to the environment that you're operating in and everyone has been tightening their credit policies over the last sort of 18 months or so."",
  ""So, yeah, I think they'll lift about further and then they'll actually drop quite sharply from the middle of next year would be my guess, if you like."",
  ""It's a good question, Yeah."",
  ""I mean, part of our kind of risk management is that we have steered away quite deliberately from some forms of commercial lending, particularly in the transport sector and forestry."",
  ""Anything that requires heavy vehicles, we have, actually, deliberately steered away from in the last sort of 12 months."",
  ""So we've seen quite a sharp drop in that book."",
  ""So, at its peak in March or around March 2022, that book – that commercial book was NZD 85 million."",
  ""It's now in the sort of low-50s."",
  ""And so, where we've seen the offset is quite strong growth in consumer."",
  ""So, part of the unlock for growth for us over the next six months is that the commercial book will stabilize."",
  ""We're sort of super happy lending on utes and vans and light commercial vehicles, just not the heavy ones."",
  ""So I think that commercial book will stabilize at around about the current levels and that will mean that our continued growth in consumer will ultimately drive a quicker growing ledger."",
  ""And, yeah, that's kind of our basic sort of thesis."",
  ""We know that we're gaining market share in that premium segment."",
  ""And we are deliberately targeting that with our pricing and with the enhancements to our system and ability to give quick answers to borrowers."",
  ""So, yeah, super confident that the growth will materialize and might not – we might not get to that 7% growth by the end of March next year."",
  ""But, I think, we'll be ballpark."",
  ""Happy to talk, Are we looking at anything else at the moment?"",
  ""There are increasing numbers of people coming to us with new car opportunities, which we are reluctant, quite reluctant to pursue just given the volatility in that segment."",
  ""Our kind of growth engines remain organic, remain extending the footprint, building out our retail footprint, particularly in Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch, but also some selected geographies that we don't currently operate from."",
  ""And then using that to leverage growth in Oxford and DPL Insurance."",
  ""So, it's still really an organic strategy."",
  ""My Auto Shop happens to fit so well within our ecosystem that it was an opportunity that we couldn't pass up."",
  ""But, largely, I think we're still an organic growth story."",
  ""It's still early days, .""

  ""It is a pleasure to speak with you today and share another quarter of strong performance."",
  ""On the top line, comparable net revenue growth of 34.6% accelerated from 21% in Q1 and 25.7% in Q2 as we anticipated."",
  ""This reflects increased consumer demand for our Obagi Medical and Milk Makeup brands and improved stock availability."",
  ""Amongst their target audiences, our brands are consistently delivering strong innovation and community engagement."",
  ""As a result, we're seeing ongoing success as we expand our global distribution."",
  ""We saw in Q3 and throughout the year robust growth evidencing the power of our operating platform that enable us to deliver increasing rates of profitability as we grow our market-leading brands."",
  ""To this end, in the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA rose 134% to 16.3% of net revenue and expanded 720 basis points from the prior year."",
  ""We continue to make progress towards achieving our vision to build a global best-in-class beauty and wellness platform that creates, acquires, accelerates, and scales the next-generation of high growth, highly profitable, purpose-driven brands."",
  ""Our repeatable Waldencast operating virtuous circle of growth and profitability is continuing to pay dividends as we continue to strengthen our efficiencies to drive gross margin expansion and invest into selling and marketing drivers to sustain and grow our top line momentum."",
  ""We're very pleased with our performance in the quarter and first nine months of the year."",
  ""We believe we're just getting started in realizing our true potential."",
  ""Let me share with you why."",
  ""First, we possess the operational scale of a multi-brand platform that would only get better as we add more brands to the portfolio."",
  ""This paired with infrastructure and beauty operational talent to support accelerated growth and EBITDA margin expansion for our portfolio of market-leading brands."",
  ""Second, we have a proven track record identifying, managing, and building global beauty brands at scale."",
  ""This success and the many opportunities we see in front of us provide us with additional path to continue to attract leading brands to our fold."",
  ""Third, we have taken a balanced approach to structuring our portfolio in attractive segments of the category that enable us to maximize growth and benefit from diversification."",
  ""We operate in the two most structurally attractive segments of the skincare and makeup categories."",
  ""Fourth, we operate an asset-light and highly efficient capital structure which give us the speed and agility and return on capital, with the operating discipline of a much larger company."",

  ""As you know, we possess two of the most exciting brands in the two biggest beauty categories."",
  ""Our brands play in the most attractive subsegments of these two categories, prestige clean makeup and professional science-led skincare."",
  ""Milk Makeup is a cult-favorite Gen Z brand and benefits organically from an engaged and diverse community due to its cultural relevance and iconic products."",
  ""It is a leading clean makeup brand."",
  ""The number two clean brand for US with 2.7 million Instagram followers and is quickly building a global following with leadership positions in several international markets."",
  ""Milk Makeup has accomplished this through its relevant promise of cool, clean makeup that works."",
  ""Obagi Medical continues its clear advantage as the number one US physician-recommended medical-grade skincare brand for top-ranked patients' needs, leading in the most attractive, fast-growing subsegment of premium skincare."",
  ""Leveraging 39 R&D partners, Obagi Medical consistently delivers breakthrough patented technology and transformative, clinically proven results."",
  ""This drives high loyalty from both consumers and physicians."",
  ""We continue to believe Obagi Medical is perfectly positioned to answer the growing needs for high-performance effective skincare, while also paving the way for expansion into other categories."",
  ""Yes, we have set our sights on building a much larger business, not just organically, but also through acquisition and brand development."",
  ""We believe we are the perfect partner for indie brands as we preserve their brand DNA and allow our acquired brands to operate with autonomy, thereby maintaining the entrepreneurial spirit of each brand."",
  ""At the same time, our platform provides many benefits from the sharing of best practices to leveraging the collective expertise of the Waldencast ecosystem."",
  ""Simply put, we provide the data, technology, talent, finance, legal, and supply chain support that elevates profitability and accelerates growth."",
  ""Let me share a real-life example."",
  ""When we acquired Milk Makeup, it was a cult favorite, but not reaching its full potential."",
  ""With our platform, we implemented the processes that improved decision making, created efficiencies, and removed cost to drive profit growth while increasing high ROI marketing spend to accelerate top line growth, and we expect this to continue."",
  ""As a result, we have created an algorithm for long-term success, as evidenced by the delivery of top-tier comparable net revenue growth of 26.9% in the first nine months of 2024 and a best-in-class adjusted gross margin of 74.8%."",
  ""Our flywheel of growth and profitability is simple and repeatable with our Waldencast talent and expertise that you can see at play in both Milk Makeup and Obagi Medical."",
  ""When we add a brand to our portfolio, we first laser focus on the expansion of gross margin by driving operational efficiency."",
  ""We then reinvest these savings into sales and marketing business drivers, which drive top line growth, further enhancing gross margin and delivering operational leverage by diluting fixed cost to produce robust profit growth."",
  ""While we have scale, we're only at the beginning of our journey to building a best-in-class global multi-brand portfolio."",
  ""Today, we possess two powerful brands that have garnered critical mass, while still having substantial runway for growth."",
  ""With Milk Makeup and Obagi Medical, we have a solid foundation in prestige skin and color."",
  ""We have a core business in the US and a growing presence in Europe and in Asia-Pacific region."",
  ""We're achieving a strong growth in attractive channels, including professional, specialty retail, and online, and expect this momentum to continue as we drive awareness of both brands beyond our core communities, continue to introduce more blockbuster innovations, and expand into other regions and categories."",
  ""Our increasing success with both brands and the power of our unique, pure-play beauty ecosystem, an industry that requires a deep and specific expertise, gives us a distinct competitive strength in attracting other brands and founders into our platform."",
  ""And now, I will turn the call over to Manuel to review our financials and outlook."",
  ""Let's now look at the performance by brand, starting with Milk Makeup."",
  ""In the third quarter, Milk Makeup generated net revenue of $31.5 million, an increase of 23.5% versus a year ago."",
  ""Momentum for Milk Makeup grew in the quarter driven by the increased awareness and buzz associated with the brand, the delivery of sought-after innovation, and our international expansion."",
  ""Specifically, this quarter, we built on the success of the Cooling Water Jelly Tints with the introduction of two additional shades; and versus second quarter, stock levels for jellies have improved, allowing the brand to better meet what has been unprecedented demand."",
  ""We also launched Hydro Grip + Glow and KUSH Higher Roller (sic) [High Roll] Brow and Mascara, which further strengthened our award-winning franchise in primers and growing cult icons with our new product offerings."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit margin of 66.6% declined 340 basis points from last year, driven by a shift in mix with increased lower margin holiday kits shipping in Q3 this year versus last year, and a shift in timing of off-price sales to third quarter this year from Q2 last year."",
  ""In addition, Q3 2023 adjusted gross profit margin had a favorable inventory provision, which aided in the Adjusted EBITDA nearly doubled to $8.5 million, while adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.1% expanded 1,040 basis points from the third quarter of 2023 as a strong revenue and growth, increased gross margin dollars offset increased sales and marketing investment in support of growth."",
  ""For the first nine months, Milk Makeup generated net revenue of $94.7 million, increasing 21.7% from the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit was 25.2% or $65.6 million, with gross profit margin expansion of 190 basis points to 69.2%; and adjusted EBITDA rose 42.5% to $24.2 million from $17 million in the first nine months of 2023, with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding 370 basis points to 25.6% of net revenue versus the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""Milk Makeup saw balanced growth across geographies, reflecting the increased relevance of the brand across the world."",
  ""Indeed, globally, more and more consumers are embracing Milk Makeup on what the brand stands for as we deliver on our promise to introduce cool, clean makeup that works."",
  ""The brand generated outstanding growth across geographies in the first nine months of the year, with revenue up 22.3% in North America and 20.4% internationally."",
  ""Milk Makeup's vision is to be the number one beauty choice of the next-generation, Gen-Z and increasingly Gen Alpha, and we have a clear, proven and sustainable growth strategy to get us there, a strategy that is anchored in four clear pillars; expanding our already cult community by continuing to Innovation and keep pushing the boundaries of what clean, cool beauty looks like by continuing to build iconic products such as our Prime + Set, Sticks, etcetera, as well as continuing to be the most innovative and exciting makeup brand with additions such as jelly tints, lip oils, and other exciting products."",
  ""Broadening our footprints of both existing categories – makeup and skincare – as well as geographies by entering new regions and spaces where we know there is a strong demand by the community."",
  ""And lastly, leverage the Waldencast platform to double down on our unique brand DNA and accelerate awareness, love, and beauty credentials sorts of product."",
  ""First, let's look at how are we expanding our community."",
  ""Milk Makeup has built organically through a very strong community relevance and engagement that keeps growing with 7.7 billion press coverage impressions year-to-date fueled by the intrinsic growth of the brand and then the excitement behind the NPD at $1.7 billion, which is 22% of year-to-date impressions."",
  ""Similarly, when looking at earned media value, Milk Makeup is ranking year-to-date as the number 14 brand in the United States with a very strong plus 83% growth year-over-year, as well as number 19 makeup brand globally growing at 90%, highlighting also the strong desirability of the brand outside of the US, which is also a driver of our international expansion."",
  ""The community love is anchored on iconic products, clean, cool beauty that works, bringing breakthrough innovation that is utilitarian, good for you, always vegan, clean, and cruelty-free."",
  ""An iconic range with our cult and award-winning core of prime and set and Sticks as well as expansion into new categories like the sold-out Jelly Tint launched in early 2024."",
  ""In Q3, we launched Hydro Grip + Glow, a unique makeup hybrid that locks in luminosity for 12 hours, that builds on our iconic Hydro franchise, as well as play into the glow boom whilst offering a benefit of long-lastingness."",
  ""We also expanded our core Jelly range, originally launched in four strong payoff colors with two softer tints that appeal to an incremental consumer need and target."",
  ""Lastly, as we have shown earlier, the demand for Milk Makeup internationally is very strong, and one of our latest expansion early Q4 was India, where the brand was launched with a big bang in Sephora with phenomenal support from the community."",
  ""Now, from the world of Milk Makeup, let's go to the world of high-performance skincare with Obagi Medical."",
  ""Obagi Medical continued its excellent performance recording net revenue of $38.7 million in Q3, representing comparable growth of 45.5% from the prior-year third quarter."",
  ""This growth was driven by success of our growth strategies focusing on introducing blockbuster innovation, increasing our global distribution, and accelerating our e-commerce channel penetration."",
  ""We are pleased to accomplish each of these objectives in the quarter."",
  ""To this end, the quarter saw us launch two innovations which we had previously announced in our last call, the power due of ELASTIderm Lift Up & Sculpt Facial Moisturizer and Advanced Filler Concentrate, which help to elevate growth across the entire ELASTIderm franchise."",
  ""We grew revenue across geographies and across channels and we saw particularly strength in e-commerce driven by our direct-to-consumer website and Amazon, aided by the tailwind of the new direct model with that digital partner."",
  ""Additionally, with better in-stock positions, we were pleased to see our physician-dispensed channel return to growth in the quarter due to better in-stock levels of key products."",
  ""We expect continuing supply chain improvements to further support expansion domestically and internationally in Q4 2024."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit totaled $30.4 million, with adjusted gross margin expanding 1,010 basis points to 78.6% from 68.5% in the third quarter of fiscal 2023."",
  ""The strong sales growth, combined with significant expansion in adjusted gross margin, more than offset the increased investment in business drivers, leading to adjusted EBITDA of $7.5 million, a 129.7% increase versus Q3 2023."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 770 basis points to 19.3% from 11.6% in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Now, looking at the first nine months of the year, Obagi Medical delivered net revenue of $107.1 million, representing comparable growth of 32% from the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit rose to $85.3 million or 79.7% of net revenue versus $57.8 million or 67.8% of net revenue in the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""This growth led to adjusted EBITDA of $20.7 million, a 60.5% increase from the first nine months of fiscal 2023, with adjusted EBITDA margin expanding to 19.3% from 15.1% for the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""Across geographies, Obagi Medical saw balanced growth with a 42.1% increase in North America and a 32.8% increase internationally in the first nine months of 2024 compared to the prior year's first nine months."",
  ""In the US, we saw outsized growth from our digital channels and a strong performance from our innovation."",
  ""Internationally, our growth remained strong, and we'll continue to gradually reestablish Obagi Medical's presence in Southeast Asia."",
  ""Since the acquisition of Obagi Medical, our vision for the brand was very clear, to become the number one physician-dispensed dermatological brand in the world."",
  ""And then the growth is centered on three strategic pillars."",
  ""First, double down on our brand DNA anchored on our professional credentials."",
  ""Second, accelerate cutting-edge science-backed innovation that serves our physician and their patients."",
  ""And then lastly, grow the brand awareness and the footprint and drive point-of-market entry into our professional channel."",
  ""Anchoring our brand DNA starts with medical-grade innovation backed with best-in-class clinical tools."",
  ""This is a role that our latest launch in ELASTIderm was targeted at."",
  ""Our ELASTIderm Lift & Sculpt Facial Moisturizer shows transformative results in three weeks and six weeks on all key benefits such as improving elasticity, fine lines, crepiness, and skin smoothness on independent clinical testing, culminating at six weeks with results showing 100% visible improvement of fine lines, 94% improvement to smoothness, 88% improvement to elasticity, and an 81% improvement in crepiness."",
  ""On the ELASTIderm Advanced Filler Concentrate, the before and after, very visibly and visually depict the transformative results of this product."",
  ""And both innovations were launched with a best-in-class education toolkit that armed professionals with the science behind the innovation and the clinical results."",
  ""This was also shown directly to consumers, and this is how some of our consumer advertising looks."",
  ""So, it is no surprise that with these execution, we saw this NPD deliver versus expectations and contribute to grow the overall ELASTIderm franchise by 189%, of which existing products accounted for 24% growth."",
  ""Qualitatively, our physician partners were delighted To conclude, we're very pleased to share a strong performance across both brands, reflecting the increased desirability, relevance, and awareness of our Obagi Medical and Milk Makeup brands."",
  ""Waldencast is poised for long-term profitable growth through the operational scale of our multi-brand platform, with only two brands but more to come in the future; expertise in managing global beauty brands at scale with big growth opportunities in both geographic and category expansion; based on our balanced portfolio anchored in the structurally attractive segments of the category; and backed by an asset-light agile and efficient structure that unlocks speed at scale; and management incentives aligned to long-term value creation."",

  ""You will find additional information regarding the definition of these non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of these non-GAAP to the most directly comparable GAAP measures in the company's ."",
  ""A live broadcast of this call is also available on the Investor Relations section of the company's website at ir.waldencast.com, which will remain available for 90 days."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to Michel Brousset."",
  ""I'm pleased to share our third quarter and first nine-month results for 2024 with you today."",
  ""Our performance continues to reflect the successful execution of our strategy that provides a powerful framework to maximize the inherent strength of our Milk Makeup and Obagi Medical brands."",

  ""Today, I will focus on our adjusted financial measures."",
  ""You can find our reconciliation to GAAP financial measures in our press release from yesterday and in the appendix of this morning's presentation."",
  ""Let's dive into the highlights of our third quarter performance."",
  ""Net revenue was $70.2 million and represented a strong 34.6% increase in comparable growth."",
  ""Obagi Medical and Milk Makeup achieved 45.5% and 23.5% growth respectively, and both brands accelerated from Q2."",
  ""Milk continues to grow strongly in Q3 2024, with increased global visibility boosted by new partnerships with four European retailers."",
  ""We also expanded our product line which strengthened our presence, especially in North America."",
  ""In Obagi, our growth has been driven by successful product launches of the ELASTIderm family and continued acceleration across the digital channels, further supported by the benefits of the shift in our Amazon distribution model at the end of 2023 to a direct operating model."",
  ""Additionally, it is benefiting in this quarter from improved inventory levels, an issue that limited our growth in Q2."",
  ""That said, while the inventory levels have substantially improved, we're still not completely out of the woods and expect out-of-stocks to still be a factor into Q1 next year."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit came in at $51.4 million."",
  ""We continue to see significant year-over-year expansion in our adjusted gross profit margin, which rose 400 basis points to 73.2% in Q3 2024."",
  ""This reflects growth of higher-margin channels of distribution and lower inventory obsolescence versus Q3 last year."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA of $11.4 million, more than doubling with 134% increase from Q3 last year."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 720 basis point year-over-year, reaching 16.3%."",
  ""This notable growth reflects strong revenue momentum and operational leverage, which more than offset the increased investment in marketing and international capabilities to support growth and future acquisitions."",
  ""Our outstanding third quarter results have built on the momentum from a strong first half, leading to a remarkable year-to-date performance."",
  ""For the first nine months of 2024, our net revenue reached $201.8 million, a solid 26.9% increase in comparable growth."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit came in at $150.9 million, up 37%, with an adjusted gross profit margin of 74.8%, a 720-basis-point improvement compared to the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA grew by 54.9% to $29.1 million, driven by strong sales growth and improved gross margin, which more than offset our increases in marketing expenses."",
  ""This brought our adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.4% in the first nine months of 2024, marking a 290-basis-point increase from 11.5% in the same period last year."",
  ""As we look ahead, our strong performance in the first nine months, the continued success of our growth strategy, and the continuous investment in our internal capabilities positions us well to carry on this momentum into the final quarter of the year."",
  ""With this in mind, for the full year 2024, we reaffirmed our prior guidance and we continue to expect comparable net revenue growth to accelerate beyond the 25.7% increase we saw in Q2 and adjusted EBITDA margin to land in the mid-teens range, a substantial growth from the 11.2% adjusted EBITDA margin achieved in 2023."",
  ""Turning to our balance sheet and cash flow."",
  ""We ended the first nine months of 2024 in a solid financial position with no near-term debt maturities."",
  ""Our business continues to have a strong adjusted EBITDA-to-cash conversion driven by efficient working capital management and limited CapEx  to our asset-light business model."",
  ""Currently, a significant portion of this cash is allocated to cover nonrecurring cost associated with the ongoing regulatory investigation."",
  ""Once this matter concludes, we expect the cash generated by the business will help us to be in an even stronger financial position by improving our capital structure."",
  ""As of September 30, 2024, we have cash and cash equivalents of $17.6 million, and we also have $30 million available on our revolving credit facility."",
  ""Our net debt totaled $154 million, and as of November 15, 2024, shares outstanding were 122.9 million."",
  ""And now, I will turn the call over to Michel.""

  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I know you can't give too much guidance for next year, but just wanted to get any color around as you look towards next year and lapping this year's huge success, how are you thinking about the cadence and the quality of innovation across both brands and how can you drive sustained outsized growth versus the market?"",
  ""You mentioned gross margins a little bit, but in light of potential tariff news, how are you planning to manage the gross margins next year and beyond?"",
  ""As you think about the gross margin on the Milk side, I think you mentioned in the commentary about higher off-price sales."",
  ""I think last quarter was lower off-price sales."",
  ""What's the difference and how do you see the trends of Milk's gross margin going forward?"",
  ""And then, Michel, can you just talk a little bit about how do you see the beauty industry performing, whether in this past third quarter and looking into the fourth quarter compared to the first half of the year?"",
  ""And then I have a follow-up."",
  ""And the follow-up, with Obagi, where are you on in-stock levels?"",
  ""How do you see those progressing?"",
  ""And also penetration into – continued penetration into other dermatologist office?"",
  ""And then just for both brands International, what you're seeing there?"",
  ""This is Sydney on for Ashley."",
  ""Any updated expectations for holiday promotional levels you can share?"",
  ""And then just curious, what you're seeing kind of in terms of retailer caution toward inventory levels and any color you can give there?"",
  ""Nice job on the quarter."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""I guess, maybe just to start off, if you could talk about how you're thinking about the innovation pipeline for Milk?"",
  ""And just keeping consumers interested, how many new products you expect to roll out each year?"",
  ""And then, I don't know if you talked about that, how much the new products make up of sales."",
  ""And then just if you could talk about like near-term focus areas and whitespace for the brand?"",
  ""And then, I don't know if you have any thoughts just on how the physician dispensed channel is doing?"",
  ""I believe the prestige data that we all get in the US by Circana maybe doesn't include that channel."",
  ""So, just curious if it's performing similarly to kind of the other data that we're seeing?"",
  ""And then, I guess last one for me."",
  ""Just any thoughts on the M&A landscape with indie brands."",
  ""I guess, are you seeing any attractive opportunities?"",
  ""And then, just curious on your thoughts on the landscape in general."",
  ""Do you think that it's becoming too saturated with too many brands or there's still a lot of opportunity there?"",
  ""Good luck this holiday season."",
  ""I was curious if you could update us on the unaided or aided, I guess, brand awareness of Milk, of the Milk brand, where it stands now, and how much improvement you've made recently?"",
  ""And what are your thoughts on distribution expansion for Milk in the US?"",
  ""And just your comment about Milk still has subcategories that it can enter and expand further."",
  ""Maybe you could just give us, without specific numbers, but just give us which subcategories in particular can you name that Milk is either not even in or has very small market share relative to the overall market share of the brand?"",
  ""We are, of course, very optimistic about next year."",
  ""Our strategy for next year, frankly, remains the same across both brands, continue to drive an increased awareness of both brands, a very strong innovation plan, and continue to expand our footprint."",
  ""So, the playbook is the same."",
  ""We are, of course, now, from a P&L structure standpoint, reaching, in gross margin, the levels what we are expected long term to reach."",
  ""So, we should expect less, of course, gross margin expansion, but even brands like Obagi, where we're nearly 80% gross margin, and we are approaching the destination of gross margin on Milk."",
  ""From a top line standpoint, there is an immense opportunity ahead of us."",
  ""We are, on both brands just at the beginning of the story."",
  ""Our innovation So, we'll see how that moves in terms of innovation rate next year versus this year, but we have other substantial mechanical levers in the brand to continue to drive top line."",
  ""So, we're very confident in our next year."",
  ""We are not updating the guidance yet, but generally speaking, we're looking to 2025 with a lot of optimism."",
  ""We don't think gross margin substantial – tariffs are not a substantial impact to our business."",
  ""In the case of Obagi, there is very little business sourced from China."",
  ""Most of our – if not nearly 100% of our CMOs are North America based."",
  ""In the case of Milk, we have a roughly 10% to 15% of our cost of goods coming from China."",
  ""But we have, as we have done in the past, ways to shift some of these to other places if that is necessary."",
  ""So, we don't expect the tariff impact to be material, and we have still ample place within gross margin to manage that."",
  ""As I mentioned, we don't expect a lot of gross margin expansion again, but we do have quite a bit of cost savings to be had in gross margin."",
  ""We expect that to be reinvested into product packaging, and if need be, in the case of Milk, to be able to manage what we think is going to be ultimately a modest impact from tariffs."",
  ""Yeah, gross margin on Milk, there's a little bit of a temporary sort of a phasing issue on off-price sales."",
  ""Last year, they were more in Q2."",
  ""This year, they're more in Q3."",
  ""They're not substantial or significant."",
  ""It's part of our planned kind of gross margin landing of the year."",
  ""As I mentioned many, many times in these calls, we do not manage the company on a quarterly basis."",
  ""We manage it on a daily basis, but we'll plan on landing specific numbers on a quarterly basis as part of just normal phasing of how things are falling one place or the other in terms of off-price sales, where we clear We have these quarters as well the impact of our holiday kits that is coming, also a little bit of phasing differences versus last year."",
  ""And as we mentioned on the release, in the base of last year in Q3, there was a bit of a provision release on Milk."",
  ""So, there's nothing structural in the business or on the gross margin."",
  ""As I said, we continue to make substantial progress."",
  ""That is where I think Regarding the beauty market, I mean, the beauty market, I mean, we've discussed this before and there's many people that have commented on these."",
  ""The market continues to normalize."",
  ""The prestige market has been plus 7% year-to-date in the US according to Circana."",
  ""Skincare has moderated a bit at plus 3%, but the market continues to be strong and thriving."",
  ""It is one of the beauties of the beauty industry that it's a business that is quite resilient, quite strong in terms of growth and continues to deliver across multiple actors in the market profitability."",
  ""Of course, some will have some specific, in many cases, self-inflicted issues, but the market is strong."",
  ""Lastly, and again a point that is very important when – on view and the public view as well because when we think about growth, the market for us is just a data point."",
  ""We are relatively small, we're very small company, a very small player."",
  ""Our ability to grow the business, as we've demonstrated by the results that we continue to post quarterly, is more limited by our own ability to execute well to grow our business, to create propositions that are compelling and seductive and interesting to consumers more so than the market."",
  ""We have plenty, plenty, plenty of levers for growth in which the market, while important, is just a data point of information is now something that sets up our destiny."",
  ""And you had a follow-up, right, Dana?"",
  ""As we mentioned in the last release and we mentioned today, we've had some issues of our own out-of-stock inventory on Obagi we have in Q2."",
  ""These are substantially better in Q3."",
  ""We believe that it's going to take at least another couple of quarters to completely restore the level of stock on the business."",
  ""It's a consequence of, as we mentioned before, very strong demand for our products on Obagi as well as some inventory management that we did in prior years to be able to achieve the right level of working capital on the business."",
  ""But, today, we are substantially better than in Q2, which is impacting to some level Q3 and will continue – we think will completely normalize by the end of Q1."",
  ""In terms of penetration of physician business, I mean, we are among, if not the – among the most penetrated brands in physician offices and medical practitioners in the country."",
  ""We are, of course, continuing to add accounts and we continue to build that update."",
  ""We think that there is a substantial opportunity in two ways, not just to build penetration, but also build dollars per account on the accounts where we are present."",
  ""I think we could think that it's a tremendous opportunity and that's what we are seeing today in our numbers as we launch – drive innovation that is addressing new patient needs, new consumer needs, we are seeing more dollar flow is also from the same offices."",
  ""So, it is something of – both in terms of levers of growth, in terms of physicians' offices, but also dollars per office in what we are building."",
  ""And then lastly, internationally, I mean, on both brands, we're just at the beginning."",
  ""Couple of years ago, we bring – until recently I guess on Milk Makeup was essentially a North America brand with a little bit of international business."",
  ""We are growing substantially our international business."",
  ""We're just at the beginning of our process."",
  ""So, we expect the international expansion of both brands to be substantial and what is attractive about both brands is that the pent-up – I would say that the brand equity reservoir that we have built in the US allows us to launch efficiently in other markets, as demonstrated of what – for example, so I think we've shown you on Milk as well as Obagi."",
  ""When we launch into a market, without us doing particularly advertising or any particular demand creation plan in that market that is new, we have a tremendous amount of success."",
  ""We show you pictures before of the lines in LICO in Scandinavia of consumers waiting to buy Milk right before."",
  ""And it's obviously because they are heavily influenced by the social media and the global reach of our social media and community."",
  ""So, lots of opportunity internationally on both brands."",
  ""In terms of holidays, holiday plan, quite similar to what we saw in prior years."",
  ""I think if you look at the market and what we expect of the market into the holidays purchase intentions, we see that an increase of intentions by shoppers."",
  ""I think we've kind of published a report just recently which 29% of shoppers plan to purchase beauty product gift this year."",
  ""Notably, 41% of household with children intend to buy beauty this year, which is 11% points higher than our intentions on prior year."",
  ""So, the holiday season continue – I mean, beauty continues to be becoming more and more a staple of the holiday season, and our plans remain fairly consistent from a promotionality versus Regarding the overall kind of retail environment, we are seeing, because of the macro environment, sort of being specific issues with some retailers, some more caution around management of inventory."",
  ""We've seen that a little bit more so outside of North America than in North America, but we're not seeing more recently in North America."",
  ""There's a bit of inventory correction and purchase correction that we're seeing on selling on retailers."",
  ""Difficult for us to predict whether this will continue into Q1 or not, but we are definitely seeing a bit of more prudency on levels of inventory and open to buy and things like that on the business side."",
  ""I mean, innovation is the lifeblood of beauty and particularly in a makeup brand like Milk."",
  ""We are, of course, seeing this year with the launch of But at the same time, when we look at Milk and the number of – the subcategory of – number of penetration of subcategories within makeup that we have, we're just at the beginning."",
  ""I mean, we are – we do not have a presence in a number of important subcategories of makeup that allows us to have a substantial runway on a go-ahead basis."",
  ""We're particularly excited about what's coming next year, which we'll revealing to you in due time of new incremental categories for the company whether it's very Milk that is very charismatic, unique, tangibly superior, with great design in a very unique way."",
  ""Innovation, as we know in beauty, particularly in makeup, it's a little bit hard to forecast and a little bit of hard to predict how exactly it's going to – how exactly things are going to pan out."",
  ""But because of our hand on the pulse with culture, hand on the pulse with our community, we believe that we have a fantastic innovation plan for next year."",
  ""We do not disclose percent of sales on new product and things like that."",
  ""But we're very optimistic about what the innovation plan is for Milk."",
  ""It's part of the secret sauce of Milk, which is having always a hand on the pulse of what innovation, what is happening in the community to respond to things that are interesting and compelling."",
  ""The Circana data, that's not included the physician channel."",
  ""There's other sources that do that, but they don't do it with a frequency."",
  ""So, it's a little bit hard for us to assess exactly the quarter-to-quarter evolution."",
  ""The latest numbers we have seen from industry sources is that it's growing around 6% to 8% in that range, but we don't have very firm kind of quarterly numbers and they're more self-reported."",
  ""So, the quality of the data is not as robust, I would say."",
  ""Now that said, it is very clear."",
  ""What is very, very clear, there's a very strong shift So, demand is just really strong, very strong."",
  ""As we mentioned before, in Q2 we had a bit of our own issues in terms of our ability to supply with out-of-stocks and so on and so forth that are starting to normalize and improve substantially within this quarter."",
  ""But the markets for medical, science-based, physician-dispensed is thriving."",
  ""I mean, we can't comment on the specific M&A plans, but there is certainly the beauty industry has always been an acquisitive market."",
  ""If you look at the bigger strategic players, L'Oreal or There's plenty of targets for us that could be great opportunities to add to our portfolio."",
  ""But the way we're building the portfolio and the way we want to do, we're very choiceful about what we add to the portfolio."",
  ""So, it's a bit of a processing which have kind of mutual assessment of what do we want to do and From a valuation standpoint, valuations interestingly has not – I mean, there's been less run through."",
  ""Transaction valuations have not come down substantially, at least yet, on most of the transactions."",
  ""I think great assets and great brands are still in high demand."",
  ""They will always be in high demand because beauty – different than other consumer categories in my opinion – is more of a growth-driven story with very high gross margin."",
  ""So, the multiples you see in beauty are high because the fundamental expectation of an acquisition is not a cost savings or cost synergies type of gain that we see on other industries, but a way to fundamentally drive and accelerate growth."",
  ""So, plenty of great opportunities ahead of us."",
  ""I mean, we don't disclose specific awareness numbers."",
  ""I think what we disclose is our community, which I think is the best proxy of people that engage."",
  ""It's interesting, of course, about aided and unaided awareness."",
  ""What is more important for our brand is how many people are actually engaged with you and follow you and build on our business?"",
  ""Just over the last year, just take Instagram as an example, we've increased our followers on Instagram by 700,000 to 2.7 million Instagram followers."",
  ""Our community continues to grow."",
  ""We just crossed 1 million last quarter."",
  ""We crossed the 1-million threshold on TikTok."",
  ""So, our community continues to grow and thrive."",
  ""I think the buzz on the brand as measured by the EMV, the earned media value – again, much better approximation to actual purchase and growth of the brand than just a generic awareness number – continues to grow and improve on the brand."",
  ""We're number 14 in the US year-to-date."",
  ""We peaked near the Jelly's launch at about number six during the Jelly's launch."",
  ""So, the brand continues to go from momentum to momentum."",
  ""It is a brand that is getting to an awareness and a high that it becomes interesting."",
  ""Of course, everybody is looking at that and the brands and the awareness of the brand and there's a lot of potential distribution partners that are in the US as well as globally very interested in carrying the brand and building on the brand."",
  ""We have expanded distribution internationally."",
  ""We have four new retailers that have built into this year."",
  ""And these are LICO, that we showed you early on, Boots in the UK, Douglas in Germany, and Sephora India most recently with tremendous success, right?"",
  ""So, we are expanding distribution internationally where it makes sense, and we will continue to evaluate distribution opportunities that make sense."",
  ""As we mentioned before, one thing that – especially managing a makeup brand where one has to be quite careful is not to expand distribution too far ahead of demand and awareness."",
  ""And our approach decision has always been to control the distribution, keep it very tight and very productive."",
  ""So, we want to maintain high level of productivity where we are."",
  ""Of course, I can use the biggest category."",
  ""I mean, the liquid foundation is the biggest category in makeup."",
  ""Depending on how you read it, it's around 14% of the makeup market."",
  ""We don't have a liquid foundation, right?"",
  ""We're not present in the biggest – just to make one example of many, we're not present in the biggest category of makeup, which is liquid foundation."",
  ""We don't have any lipsticks in our business."",
  ""Again, I am not saying we're going to launch in those categories, but I'm just saying – in the near future, what I'm saying is there's plenty still of opportunity."",
  ""What we have is very strong presence in a relatively small subset of categories."",
  ""We have a very strong prime and set business, right, where we have market-leading positions in those categories, but we are not at all present in some others or barely play in others."",
  ""So, plenty of opportunity also from a product and innovation standpoint."",
  ""Obviously, you have to pave that innovation."",
  ""We need to make sure that when we launch, we have a compelling winning proposition to be able to enter those battles because some of those markets are very competitive but also some of those markets are very attractive because if you crack them, like, for example, complexion or liquid foundation or things like that, they tend to be high loyalty, stickier categories than other categories."",
  ""So, those are a couple of examples."",
  "", So, we will continue to increase media and marketing support on both businesses quite substantially."",
  ""We've been increasing those quite substantially since we bought both brands and we'll continue to do that into the future."",
  ""Well,  very much for joining us on this call and looking forward to speaking to you."",
  ""For some of you, I'm interested in speaking to all the analysts and others in the future.""

14,3141022,000KYW-E,2024-12-18,"[
  ""Entering fiscal 2025, our top priority was to accelerate our organic net sales growth, and specifically our volume growth, by delivering remarkable experiences to consumers across our leading food brands."",
  ""As we look at the first half of the year, we made encouraging progress accelerating our volume growth and market share trends, including returning our North America Pet business to growth."",
  ""General Mills' first half organic volume growth was 4 points better than our fiscal 2024 result, and we drove a significant increase in the proportion of our business growing share."",
  ""Our pound share has improved most notably, with dollar share improving at a slower rate as we expected given our investments to increase value for consumers."",
  ""These results are due to our continued focus on delivering remarkable experiences to consumers across the total product offering."",
  ""We are investing to bring consumers superior products and benefits at the right value, supported with remarkable brand-building and omni-channel visibility."",
  ""This work drove improved performance on many important businesses such as pet food, cereal, fruit snacks, and our Foodservice product lines."",
  ""At the same time, we have more work to do in other places, with refrigerated dough offering the biggest opportunity for improvement and challenging consumer trends in China continuing to present a headwind in that market."",
  ""To achieve and build on our broad-based improvements in volume and share, we've stepped up our investment to bring greater value to consumers, which results in a lower outlook on operating profit and EPS in fiscal 2025."",
  ""Amidst a dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop for consumers, we believe this is the right choice to further strengthen the remarkability of our offerings which will better position General Mills for sustainable growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond."",
  ""Our Q2 results are summarized on slide 5."",
  ""Organic net sales were up 1%, adjusted operating profit was up 7% in constant currency, and adjusted diluted EPS was up 12% in constant currency."",
  ""These results were ahead of our expectations, especially on the bottom line, even as our outlook on the year has come down."",
  ""The key reason for this unusual difference is that our Q2 results benefited from timing-related items that drove a 1.5-point benefit to net sales and a 6-point benefit to operating profit and EPS, all of which are expected to reverse in the second half."",
  ""Kofi will provide more context on these items and our back half expectations later in the presentation."",
  ""Slide 6 outlines our three key priorities for fiscal 2025."",
  ""As I mentioned upfront, our number one priority is to accelerate our organic sales growth by delivering remarkable consumer experiences across our leading food brands, resulting in a stronger volume and improved market share performance."",
  ""Second, we will create fuel for investment by generating strong levels of HMM cost savings to offset inflation and reinvest back into our brands."",
  ""And third, we will continue to drive strong cash generation while maintaining our disciplined approach to capital allocation."",
  ""Slide 7 shows our pound and dollar share performance through the first half of fiscal 2025."",
  ""We strengthened our competitiveness in Q2 with 56% of our priority businesses growing or holding pound share and 38% growing or holding dollar share, both of which were significant improvements from Q1 and fiscal 2024 levels."",
  ""Importantly, all four segments drove improved pound and dollar share trends in Q2, and we saw our US Pet Food business return to pound share growth and held dollar share for the first time in more than two years."",
  ""We'll look to build on this positive share momentum as we move through the second half of fiscal 2025."",
  ""We're seeing encouraging, broad-based improvements in our competitiveness across North America Retail as well."",
  ""North America Retail's pound and dollar trends strengthened in Q2 in 7 of our top 10 US retail categories."",
  ""Nearly 60% of our US retail priority businesses grew or held pound share in Q2."",
  ""And our results on dollar share moved up to 50% growing or holding share over the past month as we returned our US cereal business to dollar share growth behind great consumer news, advertising, and merchandising execution, including successful campaigns with the Kelce Brothers and Chex Holiday Season."",
  ""These share improvements have translated into strengthened retail sales growth across most of our US portfolio from Q1 to Q2."",
  ""Those gains have been largely offset, however, by a step back on refrigerated dough which has had a disappointing start to the key baking season."",
  ""As we move to the second half, we'll build on our improving momentum on businesses like cereal, fruit snacks, Mexican food, and soup, and we'll step up our plans and reinvest to improve our trends on refrigerated dough."",
  ""Our plan for refrigerated dough this year included product renovation news, stronger marketing behind the Pillsbury Doughboy, and targeted investments in value."",
  ""As we moved through the second quarter, it became clear that our product news and media support were not breaking through because we didn't have the right value for consumers at the shelf."",
  ""We've taken a number of actions recently to reverse the trends on refrigerated dough."",
  ""We've already brought more value to consumers in December by adding investment to narrow price gaps across a broader range of items."",
  ""We're stepping up our taste renovation news in the second half across 30% of our portfolio, with new more cinnamon news on Pillsbury cinnamon rolls and continued support behind our more flaky layers news on biscuits."",
  ""We're launching new Cookie varieties, including Monster Cookie and Double Chocolate flavors, as well as Grinch holiday shapes, to accelerate the strong growth we've been delivering since we unlocked new capacity earlier this year."",
  ""And we're significantly increasing our media support in the third quarter to ensure Pillsbury has greater visibility through the remainder of the key baking season."",
  ""The return of the Doughboy and our new campaign is working, and we expect media investment to be up more than 40% on our canned dough line in Q3."",
  ""Stepping back, we've driven tremendous growth on Pillsbury refrigerated dough over the past five years."",
  ""Getting this business back on track will be key to improving our North America Retail growth prospects."",
  ""We're confident that the actions we're taking to increase remarkability will improve our momentum going forward."",
  ""Turning to North America Pet, I'm proud of the continued progress we've made to restore this business to growth by focusing on Blue Buffalo's ingredient superiority and executing our improvement plans across the portfolio."",
  ""While we're not all the way to where we want to be, we've continued to drive sequential improvement in our market share with our pound share growing and dollar share flat in the US in Q2, and we like the positive momentum we're seeing across our key product lines."",
  ""We drove high single-digit retail sales growth on our Life Protection Formula dry dog food business in Q2, leveraging compelling advertising focused on ingredient superiority."",
  ""We dramatically reduced the retail sales declines on our Wilderness dry dog food line by addressing a few key challenges."",
  ""We launched new comparison advertising highlighting Wilderness' higher protein content versus a key competitor, we introduced smaller bag sizes to provide lower absolute price points for pet parents, and we reintroduced grain-free varieties that are driving incremental household penetration gains."",
  ""On wet food, we adjusted our price points on targeted offerings to get below key price cliffs, and we're seeing positive returns."",
  ""Our treats portfolio is where we have the most work still to do, but even here we're seeing green shoots with better self visibility and good merchandising execution, driving improved turns at key customers."",
  ""And we continue to strengthen our pet portfolio earlier this quarter with the announcement of our proposed acquisition of Whitebridge Pet Brands' North America premium cat feeding and pet treating business, which includes the Tiki Pet and Cloud Star portfolio brands."",
  ""The jewel of this acquisition is the Tiki Cat brand which has a strong presence in wet cat food, the fastest-growing segment within the US pet food category and an area where Blue Buffalo is underdeveloped."",
  ""Retail sales for Tiki Cat were up more than 20% over the past year."",
  ""And with household penetration still below 2%, we see tremendous runway for future growth."",
  ""We expect the transaction to close shortly, and we're looking forward to welcoming the Whitebridge team to General Mills and working with them to expand our mission of loving and feeding more pets like family."",
  ""In North America Foodservice, we continue to deliver strong market share growth across the segment with more than 70% of our priority businesses growing or holding share in Q2."",
  ""Our world-class R&D team is providing category-leading renovations in service of our operators, leveraging the Remarkable Experience Framework."",
  ""In Q2, we launched a product renovation on our baked biscuit line, delivering improved product quality while also doubling the hold time, which helps operators better manage labor shortages and minimize product waste."",
  ""We're already seeing strong excitement and sell-in with key distributor partners on the back of this news."",
  ""We also continue to drive strong share results in non-commercial channels, including continued share growth in K-12 schools."",
  ""We built our leading position in cereal  to our ongoing commitment to nutritional leadership, leveraging our two (sic) [2-oz] (00:10:52) Equivalent Grain packaging innovation and our reduced sugar offerings."",
  ""In International, we made progress stepping up our market share performance on our global platforms while continuing to navigate challenging macro headwinds in China."",
  ""We grew or maintained share on 45% of our priority businesses in Q2 driven by improving share performance in our distributor markets and Europe and Australia regions."",
  ""This included strong performance on Häagen-Dazs which delivered share growth in retail outlets in Q2 fueled by increased distribution on core flavors like Belgian Chocolate and Strawberry."",
  ""Our China business continue to see double-digit traffic declines in our Häagen-Dazs shops in Q2, but we're working to mitigate those headwinds by expanding distribution in retail, foodservice, and e-commerce channels."",
  ""Our second enterprise priority for fiscal 2025 is to create fuel for reinvestment back into our business through industry-leading HMM cost savings."",
  ""Even as we have added incremental investment to support stronger volume and share growth, the midpoint of our updated guidance ranges still translates into an adjusted operating margin profile in fiscal 2025 that is higher than our pre-pandemic margin."",
  ""We've done that by delivering record levels of HMM, including a forecast for 5% savings in our cost of goods sold this year, which is ahead of our long-term trend."",
  ""This elevated HMM delivery continues to provide fuel to invest in our brands and capabilities for the long-term."",
  ""Our third priority, continuing to drive strong cash generation."",
  ""We expect to deliver at least 95% free cash flow conversion in fiscal 2025, consistent with the guidance we provided at the start of the year."",
  ""We remain committed to our long-standing record of deploying our cash in a disciplined and shareholder-friendly manner through capital investments, dividend growth, M&A, and share repurchases."",
  ""On M&A, we continue to advance our portfolio reshaping ambitions and improve the growth profile of our business."",
  ""Once our North American Yogurt divestitures and Whitebridge Pet acquisition are closed, General Mills will have turned over approximately 30% of our net sales base since fiscal 2018."",
  ""In terms of future M&A, our near-term focus is on ensuring our organization is set up to deliver seamless transitions for each of those three transactions."",
  ""As we look further out, we remain focused on bolt-on acquisitions as our most likely opportunities for M&A. Before transitioning to Kofi, I'll highlight our updated fiscal 2025 guidance on slide 17."",
  ""We reaffirmed our organic net sales guidance, with our current expectations toward the lower end of the range."",
  ""Adjusted operating profit and adjusted diluted EPS growth are each expected to be 2 points below our prior ranges, reflecting the incremental investments we're making to support our volume and market share gains."",
  ""And we remain on track to deliver free cash flow conversion in line with our previous expectation."",
  ""With that, let me turn it over to Kofi to go into more details on our second quarter results and the assumptions behind our updated outlook for the year."",
  ""I'll close out with a few thoughts."",
  ""We're encouraged by the progress we've made to accelerate our volume growth and improve our market share trends, driven by our continued focus on delivering remarkable experiences to consumers across the total product offering."",
  ""To deliver those gains and build on them going forward, we've made incremental investments to bring consumers greater value amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop."",
  ""I'm confident in our teams, who are operating with agility and doing what's right for our consumers."",
  ""And I'm confident that the actions we're taking will better position General Mills for sustained growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond."",
  ""This is Jeff Siemon, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance."",
  "" for listening to General Mills' prepared remarks for our Fiscal 2025 Second Quarter Earnings."",
  ""Later this morning, we will hold a separate live question-and-answer session on today's results, which you can hear via webcast on our Investor Relations website."",
  ""Joining me for this morning's presentation are Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; and Kofi Bruce, our CFO."",
  ""Before I hand things over to them, let me first touch on a few housekeeping items."",
  ""First, on our website, you'll find our press release that posted this morning, along with a copy of the presentation and a transcript of these remarks."",
  ""Please note that today's remarks include forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions."",
  ""The second slide in today's presentation lists several factors that could cause our future results to be different than our current estimates."",
  ""And with that, I'll turn it over to Jeff."",
  ""Our second quarter financial results are summarized on slide 19."",
  ""Reported net sales of $5.2 billion were up 2%, and organic net sales were up 1%."",
  ""Adjusted operating profit of $1.1 billion was up 7% in constant currency, driven by HMM cost savings and higher volume, partially offset by input cost inflation, unfavorable price/mix and higher SG&A expenses."",
  ""Adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $1.40 in the quarter and were up 12% in constant currency, driven by higher adjusted operating profit and lower share count."",
  ""As Jeff mentioned, our Q2 results were impacted by certain favorable timing items, including an increase in retailer inventory in NAR due in part to the giving holiday shifting from the final week of Q2 last year to the first week of Q3 this year, as well as favorable trade and other expense timing."",
  ""These items represented approximately a 1.5 point benefit to net sales and a 6 point benefit to operating profit and EPS in the quarter."",
  ""We expect these timing items to reverse in the second half with most of the impact in Q3."",
  ""Slide 20 summarizes the components of total company net sales growth."",
  ""Organic net sales increased 1% in the quarter, driven by higher organic pound volume, partially offset by lower price/ mix."",
  ""Foreign exchange and the net impact of acquisitions and divestitures were not material to net sales in Q2."",
  ""Shifting to segment results, second quarter organic net sales for North America Retail were up 1%."",
  ""Our organic net sales outpaced Nielsen-measured US retail sales by roughly 2 points, driven by an increase in retailer inventory due in part to the impact of the later giving timing."",
  ""We expect this retailer inventory build to reverse in the third quarter."",
  ""Organic net sales in Q2 also benefited from faster growth in non-measured channels."",
  ""At the operating unit level, net sales for US Morning Foods increased 4% and US Snacks were up 1%."",
  ""Net sales for US Meals and Baking Solutions were down 1% and Canada net sales declined 4% in constant currency."",
  ""As Jeff noted, we strengthened our competitiveness in NAR with our pound and dollar trends improving in seven of our top 10 US categories from Q1 to Q2."",
  ""On the bottom line, constant currency segment operating profit in NAR essentially matched year-ago results driven by HMM cost savings and favorable price/mix offset by input cost inflation, higher other supply chain costs, and lower volume."",
  ""Moving on to slide 22, second quarter organic net sales for our North America Pet segment were up 5%."",
  ""This result outpaced our Nielsen-measured retail sales performance by roughly 4 points."",
  ""The difference reflected a rebuild of retailer inventory after significant reductions in the second quarters of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024."",
  ""We do not expect to see a material change in retailer inventory in the second half."",
  ""Net sales are up high single digits for dry food, up mid-single digits for wet food, and up low single digits for treats."",
  ""Q2 represented our fifth consecutive quarter of sequential market share improvement for our US Pet Food business with our pound share growing and our dollar share flat in the quarter."",
  ""On the bottom line, second quarter North America Pet segment operating profit was up 36% in constant currency driven by HMM cost savings, higher volume, and lower other supply chain costs partially offset by unfavorable price/mix and higher SG&A expenses, including an increase in media investment."",
  ""North America Foodservice organic net sales were up 8% in the quarter driven by a mid-single-digit increase in organic pound volume and positive price/mix."",
  ""Net sales results were led by strong growth on breads, cereal, and frozen meals."",
  ""We continue to drive strong market share gains year-to-date across key channels, including K-12 schools, healthcare, and colleges and universities."",
  ""On the bottom line, second quarter North America Foodservice segment operating profit was up 24% in constant currency driven by favorable price/mix."",
  ""Moving to slide 24, second quarter organic net sales for our International segment were down 3% driven by declines in China and Brazil, partially offset by continued growth in our distributor markets as well as Europe and Australia."",
  ""As Jeff mentioned, continued macroeconomic consumer headwinds in China drove double-digit declines for Häagen-Dazs shops traffic in the market, and we are working to mitigate those headwinds by expanding Häagen-Dazs distribution across retail, foodservice, and e-commerce channels."",
  ""Within our retail outlets, we continue to drive sequential improvement in market share on Häagen-Dazs, reaching share growth in Q2."",
  ""Second quarter segment operating profit totaled $24 million compared to $35 million a year ago driven by unfavorable price/mix and higher S&GA expenses, partially offset by HMM cost savings."",
  ""Slide 25 summarizes our joint venture results."",
  ""In Q2, Cereal Partners Worldwide net sales were up 2% in constant currency, with growth in Latin America partially offset by declines in France and the UK."",
  ""Häagen-Dazs Japan net sales were up 1% in constant currency, reflecting growth on our handheld formats, partially offset by lower contribution from the timing of new product launches in cup formats."",
  ""Second quarter combined after-tax earnings from joint ventures of $30 million were up 23% in constant currency driven by lower input costs and favorable price/mix at CPW, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses and a decrease in volume at CPW, and higher input costs at Häagen-Dazs Japan."",
  ""Turning to margin results, our second quarter adjusted gross margin increased 130 basis points to 36.3% of net sales driven by HMM cost savings, partially offset by input cost inflation and unfavorable price/mix."",
  ""Our second quarter adjusted operating profit margin increased 100 basis points to 20.3%, with benefits from higher adjusted gross margin partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percent of net sales."",
  ""The timing benefit I referenced earlier added roughly 100 basis points to our Q2 adjusted operating profit margin, and we expect that to reverse largely in Q3."",
  ""Moving on to other noteworthy Q2 income statement items."",
  ""Adjusted unallocated corporate expenses decreased $23 million in the quarter, driven by certain favorable one-time items."",
  ""Second quarter net interest expense was up $7 million, driven by higher average long-term debt balances."",
  ""The adjusted effective tax rate of 20.1% compared to 20.8% a year ago, driven by favorable earnings mix by jurisdiction compared to last year."",
  ""Finally, average diluted shares outstanding in the quarter were down 4% to 560 million, reflecting our continued net share repurchase activity."",
  ""Our first half financial results are summarized on slide 28."",
  ""Net sales of $10.1 billion essentially matched year ago results on an organic basis."",
  ""Adjusted operating profit of $1.9 billion was up 2% in constant currency, while adjusted diluted earnings per share totaled $2.47 and were up 6% in constant currency."",
  ""Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow on slide 29, first half operating cash flow increased 19% to $1.8 billion, driven primarily by a change in accounts payable, partially offset by changes in inventory and other current assets."",
  ""Capital investments in the first half totaled $301 million."",
  ""And we returned $1.2 billion in cash to shareholders in the first six months of the year through dividends and net share repurchases."",
  ""On slide 30, we've provided a few updates to our key financial assumptions for fiscal 2025."",
  ""As Jeff stated earlier, our improvement in volume and market share is requiring higher promotional investment than we initially planned."",
  ""A portion of that incremental investment fell in the first half, and we expect a greater portion to hit in the second half."",
  ""Within cost of goods sold, we continue to expect HMM cost savings to outpace input cost inflation for the full year."",
  ""We now expect to generate HMM savings of 5% of COGS, and input cost inflation is now expected to be 4% of COGS in fiscal 2025."",
  ""As we look to the second half of fiscal 2025, the midpoint of our revised guidance implies adjusted operating profit would be down roughly 8% in constant currency."",
  ""This reflects a 3 point headwind from the reversal of favorable timing items in the first half, a 3 point headwind from incremental growth investments, and a 2 point headwind from a partial reset of incentive compensation."",
  ""With these assumptions in mind, our updated annual fiscal 2025 financial outlook can be seen on slide 31."",
  ""Organic net sales are still expected to range between flat and up 1%, with our current outlook targeting the lower end of that range."",
  ""Adjusted operating profit is now expected to be down 4% to down 2% in constant currency."",
  ""Adjusted diluted earnings per share are now expected to be down 3% to down 1% in constant currency."",
  ""And we continue to expect free cash flow conversion to be at least 95% of adjusted after-tax earnings."",
  ""Note that our outlook does not include the impact of the North American Yogurt divestitures nor the Whitebridge Pet Brands acquisition, as those transactions have yet to close."",
  ""With that, let me turn it back to Jeff for some closing remarks."",
  ""And as he said, before we get into Q&A and a more detailed business discussion, let me lay out kind of an overarching perspective."",
  ""And I go back to June, we laid out our plans for fiscal 2025, and then we said our top priority for this year is to accelerate our organic sales growth and specifically our volume growth, and we do that by leveraging our remarkable experience framework to improve our market share."",
  ""And through the first half of the year, we've executed that plan and we're seeing good results, with broad-based improvements in our volume and our share trends."",
  ""And we've done that by stepping up our investment in the business above our original plans in response to a more prolonged and I would say significant value-seeking behaviors in the part of consumers."",
  ""We're bringing more value to consumers across all aspects of our total product offering, including increased product renovation news, increased brand building and promotional support."",
  ""And as I said, these investments are working."",
  ""Leaning into our ingredient-superiority messaging, for example, on Blue Buffalo pet food business has led us back to growth."",
  ""Strong brand campaigns and innovation have helped return our US cereal business to pound share growth."",
  ""And we drove accelerated retail sales performance in some other really important US categories, including food snacks and Mexican foods, soups, snack bars as well as foodservice channels, and in many of our international markets."",
  ""But we do have other work to do in other places like on US refrigerated dough."",
  ""So, we're adjusting our plans there, and already have adjusted our plans there to ensure that Pillsbury brings more value to consumers across a broader portion of our portfolio."",
  ""And so stepping back, we are confident in our strategy and the investments we're making to further improve our momentum in the back half of the year."",
  ""And while stepping up our investment is impacting our profit outlook for the back half of the year, I am very confident that it's the right choice to position us for stronger growth in fiscal 2026 and beyond."",
  ""And so with that, Jeff, I'll turn it back to you and let's get started on the Q&A.Hi."",
  ""We appreciate you all joining us today for our Q&A session on our second quarter fiscal 2025 results."",
  ""I hope you all had time to review our press release, listen to the prepared remarks and view our presentation materials, which we made available this morning on our Investor Relations website."",
  ""It's important to note that in our Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are based on management's current views and assumptions."",
  ""And so please refer to this morning's press release for factors that could impact forward-looking statements and for reconciliations of non-GAAP information, which we may discuss on today's call."",
  ""I'm joined this morning by Jeff Harmening, our Chairman and CEO; Kofi Bruce, our CFO; Dana McNabb, Group President of North America Retail; and Jon Nudi, Group President of our North America Pet, Food Service and our International segments."",
  ""Before we open for questions, I'm going to hand it over to Jeff Harmening for a few opening remarks."",
  ""Julian, I think we can go ahead and get started with the first question, please.""
]","[
  ""   so much."",
  ""Jeff, as you mentioned, this fiscal year was always meant to be about sort of improving in-market competitiveness across the portfolio."",
  ""And I guess now that we're halfway through, I still have to get a better sense on sort of what learnings you've taken away from maybe the initial efforts and how those learnings are kind of informing your back half expectations, particularly in light of sort of the planned incremental spend."",
  ""Is it that you now see the consumer is just more ready to engage than before and maybe better adjusting their reference price points, or simply just realizing that it requires more spend than it originally anticipated to drive sort of the requisite volume, even outside of refrigerated dough?"",
  ""So, I guess, I'm just trying to get a better sense on sort of where the consumer is at this point, and maybe how much of the incremental investment is specific to dough versus some of the other brands in the portfolio?"",
  ""Have a great holiday, everybody."",
  ""Dana, maybe just to pick up on the back of Andrew's question there, I think I heard you say that the incremental investment in the back half is targeted."",
  ""I do think there's some concern this morning that it's more broad-based."",
  ""So just wanted to clarify on that."",
  ""And just the part B of that question is really how do you think about is this enough?"",
  ""Obviously, you came into the year, you had certain plans, you're now accelerating that."",
  ""How do you get confidence around the fact that the investments you're making now are going to be enough, such that in three, six, nine months, we're not necessarily revisiting this again?"",
  ""And maybe just a follow-up on Pet as well, I think if you kind of remove the retailer lap from last year, you probably still would have been up on an organic basis in Pet sales, which is encouraging."",
  ""I'm just curious kind of how you think about the context of that underlying momentum into the back half?"",
  ""I wanted to ask a little bit just in light of the – Kofi, your comments about, I think, most of the benefits, the onetime benefits in terms of trade inventory and the timing of spend in 2Q, that flipping into or reversal in 3Q. Is there any more color you can provide us on kind of how you want us to think about the shape of the third quarter, either relative to last year or relative to 2Q?"",
  ""Obviously, we can do some of the math, but just wanted to get a better sense for how that all flows into the bottom line?"",
  ""And then little more of a random question, but just seeing double-digit declines in your Häagen-Dazs business in China in stores, I appreciate that you're looking to sort of diversify the channels that you work with there."",
  ""But how sustainable do you see that double-digit decline?"",
  ""What is your outlook there?"",
  ""And is there any chance, I guess, I'm getting at that you'll consider the broader footprint of that retail store business that you have there?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""It looks like you've raised your input cost inflation for the year to 4% from 3% to 4% last quarter."",
  ""Just see if you could provide more color on the drivers behind that."",
  ""Where are you seeing the most pressure across your portfolio?"",
  ""And how do you think about your ability to mitigate some of that going forward?"",
  ""And can you separate the quarter for a minute and just talk about the regulatory environment, we have a combination of Great."",
  ""It's nice to see the progress in your own pet food results with the return to growth and the continued progress on market share."",
  ""And I think this is suggestive of the success you're having with the action plans that you've laid out and improving your own competitiveness."",
  ""But I'm curious for any updated thoughts you have on the broader pet food industry, particularly given pet population growth appears to be muted right now, maybe following some normalization post-COVID."",
  ""And then more recently, there has been news in New York State regarding banning the retail sales of dogs and cats, but just curious for broader thoughts on the pet food industry beyond your own success on competitiveness."",
  ""And then a follow-up on the US cereal business."",
  ""So, you called it out in the prepared remarks."",
  ""So, in the last couple of quad-weeks, you've definitely seen some improvement in trends in terms of your sales growth and particularly your dollar share."",
  ""It sounded like you would attribute it to consumer news, advertising, and merchandising execution."",
  ""But just any more color on what you're seeing in cereal, how you'd frame the competitive environment, and what you think about your back half expectations there."",
  ""I have a kind of like an M&A quick question then a bigger picture follow-up."",
  ""I know the guidance does not include the yogurt divestiture nor Whitebridge."",
  ""But how do you see the two of these, or perhaps can you provide any color on how the two of these deals together may impact the dilution?"",
  ""Yogurt was seeing, I think low-single-digit percentage dilutive, Whitebridge fairly de minimis."",
  ""But is there – will you be using any of the proceeds from Yogurt to fund Whitebridge?"",
  ""How do these two deals work together to inform implications for the model over the next 12 to 18 months, if you have any incremental color on that, I'd be curious?"",
  ""Then I have a quick follow-up."",
  ""If we go back over the, I don't know, many, many months at this point, of sustained normalization in the broader packaged food space, Jeff has been vocal about various things that would need to happen to drive an uptick in promotional activity, if you think about, I don't know how far that commentary goes back at this point."",
  ""And anyway, and here we are with the sector trends getting better, but clearly, based on today, not getting better or fast enough and I realize there are caveats with Pillsbury and some other dynamics."",
  ""But what do you think is your, I guess, bigger picture assessment of just the slow pace of recovery here?"",
  ""I know GLP-1s and all these other things are mentioned, which sometimes feel less tangible, but is it simply as simple as the consumer is seeking value?"",
  ""Are private-label operators becoming a lot more aggressive in going after consumers?"",
  ""How does this all kind of fit together to where we are today with clearly things taking longer?"",
  ""And if we can diagnose that, maybe there's a chance to build a bit more confidence over the next 12 months."",
  ""I know it's not an overly specific question, but if that incites any thoughts, I'd be curious."",
  ""Two quick ones for me."",
  ""The first one, just focusing on North America Retail, if I – if we look at the consumption data this quarter, the Yogurt business has actually been doing well in terms of accelerating growth."",
  ""It's actually – I think it's contributed about 50 basis points to growth in the consumption data."",
  ""I'm just curious if that's consistent with the impact on reported results, just as we think about the underlying kind of run rate of the business with that business set for divestment?"",
  ""And then question number two is actually for Kofi."",
  ""You mentioned the incentive comp reset in the back half."",
  ""And as you said, that was contemplated from the start."",
  ""But the language changed a little bit this quarter, and I think it said something like partial reset."",
  ""I'm assuming because of the guidance change there, the incentive comp build may not be 100%."",
  ""So, is there any kind of quantification of that, the relative change versus prior, that would be helpful?"",
  ""In past quarters, you've highlighted that your categories are growing 1% to 2%."",
  ""And I think share losses was really the focus that needed to be mitigated."",
  ""You gave some helpful commentary on the share loss side, but I wondered what you're seeing for aggregate category growth."",
  ""Is that holding into the extent that you anticipated?"",
  ""Are there things you can do, especially in categories where you're on quite large share to kind of stimulate the category as a whole?"",
  "" for all that color."",
  ""Also wanted to ask on expected margin trajectory for the Pet segment."",
  ""I know there were some timing benefits called out in North America Retail."",
  ""It sounded like the inventory benefits that you had this year were less so about this year having an unusual sales level and more prior years being maybe artificially low with inventory cuts."",
  ""So, I guess with that, if I look at kind of the margin base that we've seen in the past couple of quarters has been more favorable year-on-year, is that something that can continue as we move through the back half of the year, or are there timing or investment considerations for Pet in addition in North America?"",
  ""I think we've learned a couple of things."",
  ""And so, we'll start with the consumer, as you said."",
  ""I mean it's clear that from the beginning of the year to now, the consumer is – we've seen more prolonged value-seeking behavior than we anticipated back in June, and that manifests itself in a couple of ways."",
  ""I mean, one is that consumers really eat more at home, which is good."",
  ""So, you see our categories are growing."",
  ""And you see at-home consumption being about 87% of total consumption, which is quite high."",
  ""And that's because eating away from home is about 4 times more expensive than eating at-home."",
  ""So, we've seen this increased value behavior."",
  ""And so, in the sense it benefits the growth of our categories, you see our categories growing."",
  ""But what it also does is it means within our categories, consumers are seeking behavior."",
  ""And that takes a lot of different forms, and certainly, price is one of those things."",
  ""And so what we have seen this year on our business is as we have increased our investments, broadly speaking, whether that's in renovation or whether it's advertising or whether that's in promotional activity, the things that we're doing are working, and so we feel good about that."",
  ""It's just going to take a little – obviously, it's just going to take a little bit more than we had anticipated."",
  ""And I think the – what I would say, Andrew, you asked about how we see it on dough versus other things, what I would say is that we've – as we look across the different categories, we've seen – we made investments across a wide variety of categories, including in value."",
  ""But within those categories, we've done it in some pretty specific and targeted ways."",
  ""And I think maybe it might be good at this point, just to have maybe Jon and then Dana share a little bit on Pet and then North America Retail, a couple of categories, to get a flavor of what those kind of targeted investments will look like."",
  ""So, Jon, why don't we start with you and then pass it over to Dana."",
  ""So let me – you asked for Dana, so let me kind of provide a little context and then have Dana maybe provide some specifics."",
  ""So, there's this question about is it broad-based or is it targeted?"",
  ""What I would say is that we're investing in value across different categories."",
  ""So in that sense, it's broad."",
  ""But then within particular categories, it's not as if we're increasing value on every single thing that we do."",
  ""It's really targeted within categories and increasing investments in the places they matter most."",
  ""So I know there's this question about targeted versus broad."",
  ""I would say there's across a few different categories we're making investments."",
  ""But within those categories, they're very targeted."",
  ""I think Dana started already with Pillsbury, which was a good example on cookies, where it's really advertising and capacity."",
  ""But in some other places, it's more price."",
  ""So, Dana, you may want to give a couple of examples of investments."",
  ""Jon, why don't you take that one?"",
  ""Jon, do you want to...  for the question, Leah."",
  ""So that is absolutely a fair assessment of how we read the year."",
  ""A couple of things that I'd give you just as framing."",
  ""As we think about input costs, in particular our ingredient costs and some of our toll manufacturing where there's a high conversion cost linked to labor that is passed through."",
  ""And that actually still remains sticky and a little bit more inflationary than we'd expect."",
  ""In addition, we're lapping several large contracts, packaging, dairy in our EU business, sugar, where we had advantaged prices that were kind of locked in right before the inflationary period."",
  ""And so as we step off those, we're seeing some pressure points there."",
  ""So those are kind of the big ones."",
  ""And then in addition to that, we do have a smaller exposure to items which have been much in the news, in particular cocoa and fats and oils that remain pressure points."",
  ""And then as you think about the second part of your question, how do we feel – look, I think we're driving 5% HMM this year."",
  ""And we continue to have confidence in our ability to drive at least the 4% historical run rate we've been driving."",
  ""We're getting benefits from digitization in our supply chain that's providing benefits in manufacturing and logistics, reducing waste, and providing better service."",
  ""So, I think we feel pretty good about our prospects of addressing inflation in roughly this range."",
  ""Sorry, there was a bit of a bad connection there."",
  ""I think what I heard was a question on the regulatory environment and any potential impact you see to the business."",
  ""Hopefully, I got that question."",
  ""We get about one every two words."",
  ""So if I don't answer the question, just I was not trying to get around, I just didn't hear all of it clearly."",
  ""But, look, I do appreciate the question."",
  ""First, it's pretty early to talk about broadly what's going to happen in the regulatory environment."",
  ""What I can tell you is that we have and we always will follow whatever regulations are in place, whether they're state regulations or whether they're federal regulations."",
  ""The other thing I can tell you is that I mean we've got a great R&D team and very agile."",
  ""And we've been navigating regulatory environments for nearly 160 years and doing so really effectively."",
  ""And let me give you a couple of examples that I think might be helpful."",
  ""As you think about our Foodservice business, which you saw this quarter and for last many quarters has been doing really well, a lot of that business is through K-12 schools."",
  ""And the USDA has nationwide nutrition standards, which they change every five to 10 years or so."",
  ""And coincidentally, they're going to change in the next school year in 2025 or 2026."",
  ""And in that environment, when those have changed, General Mills has grown and grown share."",
  ""And it's not an accident."",
  ""And it's because we're able to reformulate our products, frankly, better and more effectively than our competitors and provide nutritional value as well as great taste and values and brands that the kids love and that the school operators like."",
  ""And so as a result, for example, our cereal share in schools is more than twice what it is in retail."",
  ""And so as we think about the regulatory environment and our ability to navigate it, just note that we have been navigating regulatory environments."",
  ""And even though it's tough to predict what's going to come, I'm confident in our ability to navigate through these things."",
  ""The last thing I think might be helpful as we think about what might come to pass is kind of what already is, and that is what's happening in California, where those legislations have been passed about certified colors and food that goes into effect in 2027."",
  ""And with that, about 85% of our cereal portfolio is already compliant, and the rest of it will be compliant by 2027."",
  ""So as we think about the regulatory environment, I mean, obviously, we take – food safety, we take very seriously, and we're going to follow all the regulations, but know that I'm wildly confident in our ability to pivot, because we have been able to do that historically."",
  ""Well, I'll let you take that one, and the comment on New York State, that's a stopper."",
  ""But I'll – Jon, I'll let you answer the rest of it."",
  ""Kofi was able to give you the first glimpse."",
  ""So, we did actually get news that we're closing Whitebridge this morning."",
  ""So, you'll see a release coming out later today on that news."",
  ""So that's good news for that deal."",
  ""Let me take a step back and answer that a little bit."",
  ""As we look at over the – I'm just going to take over the last five years or so, and what I would say is we're getting back to an environment that is more normal, that is normalizing but not yet all the way back to normal."",
  ""And you see that in the promotional environment, whether it's levels of promotion, whether it's frequency of discounting or depth of discounting is about back to where it was in 2019."",
  ""And I would say the same for our margin structure."",
  ""So, if you look at our margins, whether gross margins or operating margins, given the guidance that we just gave, they're at the same level, about maybe a little higher than they were in 2019."",
  ""And there are ups and downs as there always are."",
  ""But if you look versus five years ago, the margin structure is about the same and our business is actually quite a bit larger."",
  ""And so, the question is where do we go from here?"",
  ""The answer is really where we go from here is making sure we're responsive to consumer needs."",
  ""And Dana talked a little bit about that through the remarkability framework and us driving consumer view through promotional activity or whether it's through new products, which are up 10%, or campaigns, which she just highlighted in cereal, or Jon highlighted in pet food is back to what consumers are looking for."",
  ""And so, I think the environment – we think the environment will continue to normalize."",
  ""As you say, there's inflation."",
  ""Our inflation, we said 3% to 4%."",
  ""It's about 4%, so it's slightly higher than it was before."",
  ""And our productivity as we said 4% to 5% is now 5%."",
  ""So, our productivity is actually slightly higher than it was."",
  ""And so I want you to know, we feel good about our increasing level of competitiveness and what we've done in the middle of our P&L to get this ability to maintain margins and to accelerate our growth at the same time."",
  ""The tale of the tape really is about growth."",
  ""At the end of day, it's about dollar growth."",
  ""Our pound growth is growing slightly faster than our market share growth at the moment."",
  ""But one of the things we see is that tends to catch up over time if we're taking the right activities, and we feel great about the activities we're taking and the things we're doing to drive increased consumption."",
  ""And by the way, it started in the second quarter."",
  ""It doesn't start in the back half."",
  ""It actually started in the second quarter."",
  ""Look at our market share gains."",
  ""In the second quarter, 60% volume gains and 40% on dollar, significant increase from where we were in Q1."",
  ""So, we don't have to wait until the back half for our competitiveness to improve, but it's already started."",
  ""And that's what gives us confidence in that metric."",
  ""Yes, the investments are a little bit higher."",
  ""But it is investments, which is to say, it's not just spending, it's investments, and with investments you get a return."",
  ""And the return for us is our market share results, which are broad."",
  ""And we're very encouraged by that even if the investment levels are slightly higher than what we anticipated at the beginning of the year."",
  ""And Jon, do you want to comment on Pet, maybe Foodservice and International a little bit."",
  ""So, we're really pleased with the progress we're making on Pet."",
  ""And if you think about our biggest businesses, it's Life Protection Formula as well as Wilderness, and really it's not price investment."",
  ""It's advertising investment that's driving our business."",
  ""We love what we're seeing as we've gotten back to ingredient-superiority advertising really works for us."",
  ""And on Wilderness, we're not all the way home."",
  ""But at this time last year, in Q2, we were down 18%."",
  ""This year, we're down mid-single-digits."",
  ""In every single week, we make progress."",
  ""And we really believe that we're going to bend the trend and get back to growth in the back half of the year."",
  ""And that's really about our protein messaging."",
  ""It's about bringing back grain-free SKUs and really making sure that we have sizes that are really fit for consumers."",
  ""If anything, from a price standpoint in Pet, it's really been in dog wet as well as dog treats, where we've got – adjusted a few price points."",
  ""We're actually seeing that really pay off for us in terms of pound volume coming back, at the same time making progress from a dollar standpoint."",
  ""So, for us, in Blue, really proud of the team, really proud of the progress, it's probably more about advertising than it is about price investment at this point."",
  ""We look at investment as broader than just price value."",
  ""We use a framework called the Remarkable Experience Framework to try to assess where we are at relative to the competition across our total product offering, whether that's product, packaging, communications, price."",
  ""From a price standpoint, we have had to make a few targeted investments, but it's not everywhere."",
  ""It's on the refrigerated baked goods business, as we've talked about, a little bit fruit snacks, a little bit on our Totino's business."",
  ""But I want to reiterate that this is again more than just investment in price."",
  ""If we look at other areas in refrigerated baked goods where we're investing, we're really seeing them work."",
  ""Look at our cookie line, that's about a third of our business."",
  ""It's up high-single-digits behind new capacity that we've added."",
  ""Our campaign where we brought back the Doughboy, really resonating with consumers."",
  ""Our new products are up 10%."",
  ""We're seeing our cereal campaigns work really well."",
  ""So, yes, we're having to invest in price in targeted areas, but we're also leaning in on areas that are really resonating with the consumer, and we believe this investment will return for us in the back half of the year."",
  ""I mean, my answer is similar to what we just talked about with Andrew in the sense that the price investments are targeted."",
  ""They're in areas like we talked about with refrigerated baked goods, a little bit Totino's, a little bit fruit snacks, but again, not everywhere."",
  ""And in terms of is it enough, I do believe that we put investment into the areas that our analytics show will provide the best return, and we'll watch the response and then we'll pivot as we learn more."",
  ""So, Pete, you're exactly right."",
  ""So, we did see sales exceed movement by about 4 points in the quarter."",
  ""And you're right about fiscal 2024 Q2 and really fiscal 2023 Q2 as well, we saw the opposite."",
  ""So we're really just getting back to average inventory levels."",
  ""And importantly, as we really look at our key customers' inventory levels, they're right where we'd expect them to be."",
  ""So again, we don't expect any inventory issues as we head to the back half of the year."",
  ""And overall, we really like the trends that we're seeing on the business."",
  ""The first quarter that we've been able to hold dollar share in 11 quarters, we're back to pound share growth for the year."",
  ""Our biggest businesses are performing well, like I said, and I feel like we've got really strong plans to get treats performing better in the back half of the year."",
  ""That's probably the last business we want see an inflection on as we move."",
  ""So, we feel really good about where we're trending and don't anticipate any big inventory issues as we head to the back half of the year as well."",
  ""And I will answer probably mostly to the lens of the second half and give you a little bit of shading and perspective on how that weighs in Q3."",
  ""So as I mentioned in my remarks, there's probably about an op profit, about a 6-point benefit in the quarter for a variety of timing items, giving holiday sitting in Q3 this year versus in the last week of Q2 last year."",
  ""Additional pipeline build outside of giving and seasonal businesses in NAR."",
  ""And then phasing on trade and HMM that fell into the quarter benefited and provided tailwind in Q2."",
  ""So, the combination of those things are about 6 points of benefit."",
  ""And then as you move into the back half, right, and if you take our guidance – implied guidance midpoint, we'll give you about an 8-point decline in operating profit in the back half."",
  ""About 3 points of that comes from the reversal of those timing benefits, most of which is going to hit in Q3."",
  ""And then we got about 2 points from the incentive reset which we expected and flagged at the beginning of the year."",
  ""And then there's about 3 points from additional investment as we layer in spending in the back half to show our competitiveness, as we mentioned earlier."",
  ""So that gives you roughly the structure."",
  ""Hopefully, that answered your question, Ken."",
  ""Yeah, Ken, this is Jon, I want to take that."",
  ""So, we're absolutely looking at our footprint of stores in China."",
  ""I talked over the last couple of years, we've actually closed quite a few underperforming stores, and clearly, our focus is really on Retail as well as Foodservice where we see better margins and really the better opportunity for growth moving forward."",
  ""So, the macroeconomic backdrop is tough right now, again traffic is down, which is a challenge."",
  ""But at the same time, we're actually growing our retail business in China."",
  ""So, we'll continue to want to make that switch, really focus on really our most profitable stores moving forward, and that's something that we've been working on for, for a period of time here."",
  ""From a profit standpoint, you'll note that International was down quite a bit this quarter."",
  ""That was really off of, first of all, a small number."",
  ""And then second, we were lapping an insurance recovery at Häagen-Dazs last year."",
  ""So while the top line is down a bit, I would say that profit isn't as bad as what we're printing at this point, and we're very clearly focused on improving our trends coming out of China as well."",
  ""So, I think what we're seeing in the categories that really turned to more pre-pandemic type of trends, and you're seeing dollars come back to the category, you're seeing segments like treats that have been a bit more challenging to get a bit better over time as well."",
  ""So I think we're getting back to more normal levels of growth in the category."",
  ""Will we see a surge in adoption like we did at COVID?"",
  ""Likely not, but again, I don't think we need to see a lot of pet population growth over time."",
  ""I think getting back to where we were pre-pandemic led to a healthy category and healthy dynamics."",
  ""Encouragingly for us, we're actually seeing premium bounce back a bit as well more recently."",
  ""So it does feel like we're getting back to some of the trends that we saw pre-pandemic with humanization, premiumization really leading the way."",
  ""And we like where we sit."",
  ""The Blue Buffalo brand is incredibly strong."",
  ""I think you're aware, we announced the acquisition of Whitebridge Pet Brands."",
  ""We're excited about getting bigger in cat wet, which is the fastest-growing segment in the category."",
  ""So, we like the category a lot, and we like our position as we move forward."",
  ""As you noted, we did see an improvement in our retail sales trends on both dollars and pounds."",
  ""And we've really been focused on bringing excitement back to the category and reminding people about our big brands."",
  ""And two big activations that worked very well for us in Q2 were the Kelce brothers' promotion."",
  ""This is where the Kelce brothers spontaneously mentioned on their podcast their favorite cereals were Reese's Puffs, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, Lucky Charms."",
  ""And so, we launched a new campaign with them to bring awareness to those brands that worked really well to improve unit growth."",
  ""We also launched a new Kelce mix new product, and we got great in-store activation from both and 4 times the media impressions that we did this time last year."",
  ""So we're really encouraged by that work."",
  ""And then this is the time of the year where we also have our Chex Party Mix promotion, where Chex sells a lot of cereal to make Party Mix."",
  ""And we focused on nostalgia."",
  ""We had a Peanuts comic strip promotion, a free tin on the pack, big surround campaign, and that also drove share."",
  ""So what we're learning is that when we get on our front foot and do what we're good at, we see growth."",
  ""As we look to the back half of the year, we intend to take the same principles forward."",
  ""We're the leader of the category, so we have to behave like the leader."",
  ""We will bring our new Game Day campaign."",
  ""We have Cheerios protein launching, Cheerios heart health news."",
  ""So we will keep progressing with remarkability across the mix."",
  ""And I think we will continue to see progress in our market share."",
  ""No, I think all very fair."",
  ""I think your read of the dilution impact on both those is in roughly the right range."",
  ""What I would tell you is obviously Whitebridge just closed."",
  ""So, we are right on that today."",
  ""I think we are still, and it's an important point, awaiting closure of both legs of the Yogurt divestiture."",
  ""And so, there aren't leads at hand."",
  ""And my expectation, though is that there will still be substantial amount of proceeds going back into share repurchase activity."",
  ""We are generally comfortable with the leverage range we're running in, which is in kind of the low 3 times net debt-to-EBITDA area."",
  ""So, I think that's going to give us flexibility to both return cash to shareholders as well as accommodate the modest amount of financing necessary for Whitebridge."",
  ""We'll obviously provide you guidance once we have started closing, either both legs of the divestitures, which will have a much more material impact obviously on dilution expectations."",
  ""I'll let Dana start, and then I'll pick up the second part of the question."",
  ""So as you've rightly pointed out, the Yogurt category is growing in Q2."",
  ""It's up about 10% year-to-date."",
  ""But it's in categories that we don't compete in."",
  ""But we're seeing it in weight management line, in the group protein line, the premium lines."",
  ""The lines that we compete in, we're actually losing share in."",
  ""So when I look at what you're seeing in terms of broad-based performance for North America Retail overall, they're in our big businesses like cereal improving, soup improving, fruit snacks improving, Mexican improving."",
  ""So that's how we look at the total portfolio and consider the divestiture to come."",
  ""And then your second question on the impact of the incentive comp, the partial reset is exactly the right read on that, which is we would have expected going into the year that we reset this to 100%."",
  ""With the guidance adjustment we now expect that we'll pay out a little less than 100% but above last year's rate."",
  ""So that's what the 2 points of drag I referenced it is."",
  ""From a North America Retail perspective, great question, what I would say is that the commentary we've provided is still consistent."",
  ""We're seeing our categories normalize to pre-pandemic levels."",
  ""They're still in that 1% growth range."",
  ""And so, the onus is on us to improve our competitiveness and make sure that we're bringing a total product offering that is more remarkable than the competition across our product, packaging, in-store execution and communication."",
  ""So on Pet, as I mentioned earlier, we're seeing the category improve and it started looking a lot more like it did pre-pandemic in terms of humanization and premiumization growing and the category getting back to growth overall, which is terrific."",
  ""NAF, obviously, it's a huge world."",
  ""We play in a pretty small part of it."",
  ""And we really like the place that we play and we're seeing a lot of growth really in non-restaurant types of outlets, things like schools as well as away-from-home and airports, things like that."",
  ""So that's growing nicely for us."",
  ""We're growing a lot of share."",
  ""And as Jeff mentioned, we've got quite a large share positioned in schools."",
  ""I like how that's trending."",
  ""We also have a big frozen breads business."",
  ""So, we've got a couple of key retailers that are driving a lot of growth for us with double-digits growth."",
  ""So, the area that we play in the Foodservice is probably different than what most folks are seeing in terms of trends."",
  ""That's quite advantaged and we like our share positions there."",
  ""In International, obviously, a big role that we have parts of the world that we really like what we're seeing."",
  ""In Europe, our team continues to deliver and the categories are starting to get back to pre-pandemic levels, similar to the US, and we're growing share."",
  ""GEMs is our distributor market."",
  ""It's our fastest-growing and most profitable part of our international business, and that team's doing a great job driving mid-single-digit top line growth and grow share in most of our markets as well."",
  ""So again, a bit of a mixed picture around the world."",
  ""But generally, we like the way we're performing at some of the headwinds that we're seeing in China from a Häagen-Dazs standpoint."",
  ""Maybe I'll take that one as well."",
  ""So, I think pet things are happening in Pet and both of them are really positive, and the team is doing a great job on the margin side."",
  ""One, if you think about Blue Buffalo, it's only been a part of General Mills for six years, and we're starting to fully integrate all of our HMM tools."",
  ""And we're seeing outsized HMM as a result of that."",
  ""So again, the team has done a really nice job taking our know-how and experience to run HMM and create to practice and Blue Buffalo is starting to see the full effects of that."",
  ""I think that will continue as we move towards the back half."",
  ""The thing that we won't is that, we've internalized quite a bit of volume over the last year and we started doing that in the back half of last year, so we started lapping that."",
  ""So, I do believe that we'll continue to make good margin progress over time."",
  ""I don't think you should expect to see the kind of margin gains that we've made more recently."",
  ""But again, we're doing all the right things to keep driving our margins as we move forward."",
  ""Unfortunately, that's – we're going to have to cut it off there."",
  ""I know we didn't get to nearly as many people as we normally would like."",
  ""I think our conversations probably went more""

15,3130679,0KQHBM-E,2024-11-19,"[
  ""And , everybody, for joining us for today's call."",
  ""I want to start by just giving some high-level updates and drill into some detail that I think a lot of folks are interested in hearing more about."",
  ""So, to start off with, the objective of Monogram right now is to commercialize the first fully autonomous saw-cutting robot on the market."",
  ""That's really our clear, definitive goal as a management team, as an engineering team, every – pretty much every employee at the company right now is solely devoted to making that a reality."",
  ""As we move to the next slide, to that end we've made some pretty significant progress to date."",
  ""So, I'm going to kind of drill into, first off, the submission that's been done."",
  ""So, for those of you who had follow the story, in July we submitted our first 510(k) application to the FDA that was submitted basically following a very aggressive development push pretty far ahead of schedule kind of versus what we had been communicating to the market."",
  ""And subsequent to that submission, we received what's called an Additional Information Request, also called an AIR from the FDA that was received on September 30."",
  ""This was really not a surprise to management."",
  ""The application was almost 28,000 pages."",
  ""The FDA really it's a pretty incredible task to try and review that level of complexity in 72 days, which is how long they took to review the application."",
  ""And we now have 180 days from receipt of that request to produce the requested additional information, which would put us to March 29 of next year, would be the latest that we would be able to reply to the FDA without So, I want to kind of drill into the Additional Information Request a little bit as much as I can."",
  ""So, as part of the Additional Information Request, the FDA advised us or recommended that we request what's called a Q-Submission or Q-Sub meeting."",
  ""We anticipate that that meeting will take place in December."",
  ""So, the FDA had basically 15 comments that related to various aspects of the system."",
  ""I would characterize them in different buckets."",
  ""One bucket would just be clarification questions about how the system works."",
  ""Another bucket would be additional proposed testing or not specifically recommending testing, but making comments that could be inferred to be recommending some additional testing and then just additional clarification points and questions."",
  ""We have prepared a response, a written response to those 15 questions."",
  ""That is the company is planning on submitting actually this week."",
  ""We have spent probably hundreds of man hours looking into every single meticulous question that was asked, thinking through how we want to address the appropriate testing in cases where we think appropriate testing would be needed."",
  ""So, that document will be submitted to the FDA."",
  ""Right now, it's about 40 pages and maybe 15,000 to 20,000 words, something like that."",
  ""So it's a pretty thorough, very thoughtful document."",
  ""The FDA has about 21 days to respond to that."",
  ""So that puts us into a meeting sometime in December to go through our proposed – our response and the proposed testing that's included in that response."",
  ""We expect that during that meeting we're going to get a lot more clarity on whether our proposed testing plan will kind of fully address all of the FDA's questions."",
  ""And that teleconference, we think, is really a critical moment for the company in terms of really de-risking the application."",
  ""Obviously, nothing's guaranteed, but it certainly would be very helpful to have a conversation with the FDA and have more clarity."",
  ""And we have we believe if the FDA takes a favorable position on the testing that we have planned, we think that we have sufficient time to execute the proposed plan."",
  ""So, we wanted to really take our time to really be extremely thoughtful in terms of what our plan is."",
  ""So, that kind of tackles the AIR, and I'll be happy to answer more questions on that in the Q&A. The other major milestone update, moving to the next slide, is that the company plans to perform, as we've kind of said many times, an OUS clinical trial that is proceeding as planned on schedule."",
  ""So, we have applied for to run an OUS clinical trial for the fully autonomous version of our robot."",
  ""We are going to be running that with a group called Shalby."",
  ""They are a publicly-listed hospital chain."",
  ""They're listed in India, the Indian stock market, and that agreement will help us to execute our clinical trial."",
  ""We're going to be working with five Shalby surgeons at three Shalby sites."",
  ""The goal is to perform the surgery on 102 subjects."",
  ""The FDA is wanting us to look at four soft-tissue complications."",
  ""The acceptance criteria will be an 11.4% incidence."",
  ""The primary endpoint will be after 6 weeks with a secondary endpoint of 12 weeks."",
  ""So, within kind of three months post-op, that'll be kind of the follow-up period."",
  ""As Noel said, on the low end we expect the clinical trial to cost on the order of $1.3 million."",
  ""The reason we think it's going to be sort of economical for the company is largely because Shalby uses the same implant as Monogram."",
  ""So, we licensed an implant that we have upgraded and Shalby acquired the company we licensed the implant from."",
  ""So, it's a company called Consensus Orthopedics."",
  ""So, this is a clinically established FDA cleared implant and we are leveraging the same implant."",
  ""So, there's a lot of really nice synergy there."",
  ""It saves us a lot of money."",
  ""We don't have to worry about inventory on the implant side."",
  ""And I should highlight that the clinical trial has been reviewed formally by the FDA in February."",
  ""They indicated that they believe the population is generalizable to the US population."",
  ""So, this is really great news."",
  ""We kind of have let's call it a belt and suspenders plan to getting clearance."",
  ""So, if everything goes great in the December meeting with AIR and the FDA doesn't feel like clinical data is needed with our application, that's terrific."",
  ""If the FDA wants clinical data, that's okay."",
  ""We have a plan to get that data very quickly."",
  ""And the clinical trial will be helpful regardless because it's a clinical trial for the fully autonomous version of our system and it'll give us valuable information about our system."",
  ""We believe that the two critical, let's call them critical milestones that would come out of this – obviously, there's certainly risk."",
  ""But if the FDA were to clear our system, we think that's obviously a very significant milestone."",
  ""And if the FDA, once we have our first live in patient surgeries, we think that's also a very significant milestone."",
  ""So, the company is a really interesting inflection point."",
  ""Moving to the next slide and just kind of detailing what's upcoming."",
  ""So, this year we've kind of highlighted what we've done this year."",
  ""The big news was submitting the 510(k) application, which was a really significant lift."",
  ""I think it was a really, really strong application."",
  ""I think the team did an incredible job for the size of our team."",
  ""The dedication was really just terrific."",
  ""So it was a massive team effort."",
  ""Very happy with where that landed."",
  ""So right now, kind of the main outstanding thing to do this year is to have a Q-Sub with the FDA about that submission that was done in July and continue to push forward on getting clinical trial clearance in India where we're planning on running the clinical trial."",
  ""We have a couple of critical milestones that we anticipate."",
  ""So, we anticipate, firstly, submitting a second 510(k) for the fully autonomous version of our robot."",
  ""And we also plan on initiating the clinical trial that we've been talking about."",
  ""We expect our first live-in patient surgeries and we expect that clinical trial to move very quickly."",
  ""Shalby does a lot of volume and patient enrollment as we anticipate will be fairly efficient."",
  ""The company is also looking to expand its international relationships."",
  ""The relationship that we established with Shalby is very attractive for the Indian market."",
  ""We would like to find similar relationships in other large markets with large populations and growing demand for robotics."",
  ""We think there are a lot of attractive markets that we – that may have, let's say, lower barriers to entry or that are significantly underserved."",
  ""So, we're going to be attending our first kind of major international tradeshow early next year."",
  ""And then in terms of just planned launches, we anticipate that, obviously, depending on what happens with the system that was submitted, 2025 may be a launch year or it may be into 2026 for the fully autonomous version of the system."",
  ""But regardless, we're in a pretty exciting spot with respect to critical milestones."",
  ""Moving to the next slide, before we open up to Q&A, a big question we get is just sort of reiterating the investment thesis and the value proposition of Monogram."",
  ""When you look at the market dynamics just from a 30,000-foot view, we think that the market has never been better for a solution like we're developing."",
  ""And the reason for that is the underlying market is fundamentally changing and it's changing in a very interesting and quick way that we think may be underappreciated by the market generally."",
  ""So, I'm just going to share some select statistics that we think highlight this point."",
  ""When you look at the percentage of fellowship programs that have access to a Mako, that number is 70% of fellowship programs have access to a Mako."",
  ""And if you're going to try and get into orthopedic medicine, large joint reconstruction without a fellowship, it's incredibly difficult."",
  ""More than 90% of orthopedic residents seek a fellowship."",
  ""So, the frontend of the funnel is very much Mako dominated."",
  ""And then you look at where the robotic adoption is going."",
  ""We've seen studies that suggest that by 2030, which that's only six years away, one in two knee replacements will be robotic."",
  ""And then you couple that with the fact that 60% of orthopedic surgeons in the US will be over the age of 65 in a similar timeframe."",
  ""So, the market is changing very quickly."",
  ""The way we've done knee replacements is not the way we are going to do knee replacements."",
  ""And we think that the future, as it appears today, is very much Mako dominated."",
  ""Mako appears to control the front end of the funnel, right."",
  ""For any market, whatever is filling up that funnel that tends to be fast-forward that what's going to dominate the funnel down the road."",
  ""We think Mako has done an incredible job of locking up sort of new entrants into the market."",
  ""And then as you think about just attrition on the backside of surgeons retiring and that existing mix, the share of surgeons, kind of that mix going away over time, we think this really lends itself to the future of orthopedic medicine."",
  ""So, with that, I want to open up the floor for questions and look forward to answering any questions folks may have."",
  ""I'm just going to go over a brief agenda of today's presentation."",
  ""I'll start off with a financial summary, and then I'll hand it over to Ben to go over upcoming milestones, a review of our regulatory strategy, and then open the floor to questions."",
  ""So, here are some key points on our year-to-date financials."",
  ""We're sitting on $16.5 million in cash at the end of Q3 2024."",
  ""Our operating cash flow year-to-date is $10.9 million."",
  ""That works out to be about a $1.2 million cash run rate, which is on par with what we've had in the year and we continue to that – to be the same going forward."",
  ""The important note for this three-month period was that we had a significant financial raise."",
  ""We were able to generate $13.99 million from financing activities."",
  ""The lion's share of that came from a very successful Preferred D raise, which was upsided."",
  ""We started looking to raise $10 million and oversubscribed we ended up raising $13 million."",
  "" for your involvement in that We continue to have the same amount of full-time employees at 27 and we have a highly variable cost structure on top of that, the 27 employees primarily around R&D and the engineering staff, the other engineers that we have are outsourced and can be turned on and off as we deem necessary."",
  ""So, it's very important going forward."",
  ""We continue to have no traditional debt and we have a very minimal short-term warrant obligations that were related to the Preferred D raise."",
  ""Those are executable in 6 months and for up to 12 months."",
  ""So, it's not a long-term obligation of any sort."",
  ""Our out of US clinical trial cost estimate is about $1.2 million that's included in the run rate that we expect to go forward at $1.2 million a month."",
  ""Then we'll get into that in the milestones upcoming."",
  ""So, all things said, we expect to have sufficient access to capital through our short-term milestones."",
  ""With this raise and our current run rate, we are in a very good position to meet our obligations and in the year at a very strong balance sheet position."",
  ""So, we're very pleased with the activity this quarter."",
  ""I'll hand it over to Ben.""
]","[
  ""A question on the out of US India trial, I think we're just waiting on clearance."",
  ""Is that taking longer than we thought or sort of what's the timeline on that or what are your expectations?"",
  ""And then part two on the OUS trial, if it's approved, it goes on in 2025."",
  "" for the color on that."",
  ""A couple of quick financial ones."",
  ""So, the marketing and advertising cost in the quarter was high, obviously because of the preferred stock."",
  ""Does that go back to normal in the fourth quarter where you're five-digit numbers or six-digit numbers?"",
  ""And one more quick one Go ahead."",
  ""Quickly and I'll get back in the queue, the burn rate you said $1.2 million throughout When you say short term – is it a better way to say that you're funded until the end of 2025, or what do short-term milestones mean?"",
  ""Why not the long-term milestones?"",
  ""I'll jump back in the queue."",
  ""So, the first point about time to launch in India."",
  ""Yeah, so we – as you can imagine the – just like in the United States there is a regulatory agency that has to approve the system for clearance."",
  ""We have received soft approval to import the unit for clinical trial use for training purposes."",
  ""The clearance is still kind of in process, but we are working with one of the largest clinical research organizations in the country that has done a really, really good job helping us put together that application."",
  ""It was a painstaking application."",
  ""I think we've done a very good job with that."",
  ""I would say that India is pretty receptive to technology."",
  ""I think that there's an awareness of the value proposition of robotics for that market."",
  ""So, we feel like that's on time and at this point don't have any concerns about getting clearance to run the clinical trial."",
  ""We haven't provided any specific dates for that, largely because we don't want to peg ourselves to – without having absolute certainty on when we expect that to kick off."",
  ""But I would say that we're prepping a system now that we have clearance to import."",
  ""We're going to start prepping a system to ship over and start training the five surgeons."",
  ""And we're going to be as aggressive as possible to initiate that trial once we get the clearance."",
  ""But we would announce the clearance once we got it."",
  ""In terms of, I think your second question was, is it all cost or is there any revenue opportunity out of it?"",
  ""The clinical trial itself is going to be all cost."",
  ""Part of that is just the – we want to follow all of the best practices for running a clinical trial."",
  ""So, we really want to – we don't want to have any economic incentives or anything else."",
  ""It's really purely just a cost."",
  ""We're pretty far removed from the process."",
  ""So, the clinical research organization is really – and the surgeons are going to be responsible for enrollment."",
  ""They're going to be responsible for proper execution of the study."",
  ""We're really going to be at an arm's length when the trial is actually executed."",
  ""But we don't anticipate any revenue."",
  ""But what we do anticipate is if the trial is successful, obviously, that would – we anticipate could lead to clearance in India, which is a very significant market just to kind of help paint the picture there."",
  ""There's a company that's listed on the Korean stock exchange called CUREXO."",
  ""They're a very big player in the robotic market in India."",
  ""They guided last year, I think, on the order of 100 systems in India."",
  ""We think the market potential is much more significant than that."",
  ""We think that we have some, in terms of just how we compare competitively with their system, we think we have some favorable dynamics."",
  ""But it's a different market."",
  ""We have some technology we're working on to try and drive down our costs so that we can be as competitive as possible."",
  ""But it's a very large market, huge population, obviously, and we anticipate post clearance that Shalby could be a helpful partner for us to scale very quickly in India."",
  ""Noel do you want to take that?"",
  ""I think we – I think it's always important for us to – there's kind of a – we don't want to run things to zero."",
  ""There's kind of a point at which we always want to make sure that the tank is full, so to speak."",
  ""So I think that's part of it."",
  ""We think that there may be opportunities if we continue to execute on critical milestones."",
  ""One of the reasons we went public was to basically help clean up the cap table to become more investable by large strategic players."",
  ""We've alluded to some of the milestones being helpful for that."",
  ""I think that we have the ability to accelerate our development, but that would be in part tied to access to capital."",
  ""So, for example, what we've said is that we want to be a multi-application system, right?"",
  ""So, when you think about returns on invested capital, it is incredibly accretive for the company to deploy new applications on our system."",
  ""So, for example, partial knee, if we could develop a – we see, for example, an opportunity for a press-fit partial knee, there has not been any company in the space that has commercialized a press-fit partial knee, which is kind of the perfect application for a press-fit implant."",
  ""So, there is a possibility that we could step on the accelerator if we have the right opportunities and partners."",
  ""I hope that makes sense."",
  ""So, the burn rate could go up, but it would be tied, we feel, to very high ROI, R&D capabilities, I would say."",
  ""So, if we just sustain it where we are right now, yeah I think we have an attractive runway."",
  ""But time is of the essence to deploy new applications."",
  ""So, what I would say is just kind of going to the last slide and just reiterating the market dynamics, right."",
  ""So, when you look at the market right now, 70% of fellowship trained surgeons are being trained with a Mako system."",
  ""And you kind of think about the frontend of that funnel and then 60% of orthopedic surgeons will be 65 years old within the next seven years."",
  ""So, you kind of think about the attrition on the back end of that funnel."",
  ""So, we anticipate that that was always the investment thesis for Monogram was that we always felt like Stryker's value proposition with Mako was obvious."",
  ""We believe they have the best robot on the market and we believe that their robot has some limitations that can be overcome by a next gen system."",
  ""And if the market dynamics and the, let's call it the competitive landscape is shifting as quickly as we think it is, we think it's only kind of a matter of time before that awareness drives interest in Monogram."",
  ""Now, whether it has already driven interest in Monogram is difficult for me to speak to."",
  ""I would just say Monogram has what we think is going to be one of the most attractive orthopedic systems on the market in development."",
  ""So, I think we – I think the engineering team has done an incredible job."",
  ""I think our registration is very fast, very efficient."",
  ""I think our cutting is going to be very fast efficient, safe, accurate, our laxity planning, all of it."",
  ""So, I'm incredibly proud of how our system is performing."",
  ""We've had now well over 20 surgeons come in and use the system and verify and validate its performance."",
  ""We think the feedback is really starting to resonate."",
  ""We think that we will convert surgeons to our platform post-commercialization."",
  ""We think the surgeons we convert will be both high volume and low volume and we think we – our robot will have broad market appeal."",
  ""So, I think for somebody on the outside looking at Monogram, I think it's just really important to kind of think through all of those things."",
  ""I think it's really important to look at utilization of systems in the market."",
  ""So, Stryker has very high utilization of the Mako system, on the order of 60-plus-percent of Mako – of robotics surgeries that Stryker does – of surgeries that Stryker does are robotic."",
  ""The utilization of any other system in the market is much, much lower than that."",
  ""And so, if we move to a world where one out of two joint replacements, knee replacements is robotic, we think that just the dynamics of not having a well-utilized robot will start to cause a squeeze."",
  ""So, I would say, yeah, I mean, we're in constant communication with our peers in the space."",
  ""And I think that's what we've said publicly."",
  ""So, the big thing right now, we submitted to the FDA in July."",
  ""The FDA came back to us in September after 72 days to – with a request for additional information."",
  ""We were largely expecting that."",
  ""We think we can address all of the FDA's information requests if they accept our proposed test strategies."",
  ""So, we're cautiously optimistic, but we need to meet with the FDA, have a teleconference and review our proposed strategy in detail."",
  ""We have until March 29 of next year to do all of the proposed testing we plan to do and respond to the FDA."",
  ""And then the FDA would then have – so their target is 90 days from a submission to get approval."",
  ""So, 92 minus the 72 days that have been used gives you some idea of when we might hear back."",
  ""But conservatively speaking, we would expect to hear back in the second quarter of next year if we use the full clock to submit."",
  ""Once we have this December meeting, I would note that we're going to be as aggressive as we can to get the response in and give the FDA the data that we plan to submit."",
  ""So, that would be sort of the timeframe that we would expect to hear back by let's call it the second quarter of next year."",
  ""If the FDA requests clinical data with this submission, which was kind of always the risk, we have our plan to do the clinical trial in India kind of going from a slow simmer to soon full on ready to go."",
  ""So, we're in a pretty good position to address what needs to be done to get this thing cleared as quickly as we can."",
  ""So, I want to be really careful how we answer this, because I want to – anytime you're reliant on a regulatory agency, there's some variability that comes with that."",
  ""We've already submitted and we have received just actually today I got a notice, So, what's been communicated to me by the CRO who is well-versed on these matters, is that the application is moving as expected."",
  ""It's going through the process."",
  ""And we're eagerly anticipating kind of more news on that front."",
  ""But I would say, certainly by certainly by next year, we would be surprised if we weren't doing live patient surgeries."",
  ""So, we kind of think about that in two buckets."",
  ""And I would caveat, Tom was asking about the burn and capital."",
  ""So, much comes down to capital availability."",
  ""And obviously, we're sensitive to raising capital prices we think do not necessarily reflect the intrinsic value of the company but obviously the capital needs of the company itself."",
  ""So, with those caveats, I'll say that we expect initially to grow faster outside the US than in the United States."",
  ""And the reason for that is just the time it's going to take us to kind of fully seed the US accounts that we're targeting with implants."",
  ""And it's a little bit of a longer time to get through all of the hospital buying groups that we've been – we have surgeons that have relationships with so – and also the servicing of US revenues is a little more involved."",
  ""So, whereas OUS, Shalby already has the implant, we would be a little bit more of a open platform model where we would supply the robot and sell the consumables and some software piece."",
  ""So, all that to say, we, if you look at the comps in India for the CUREXO system, they did 100 units last year."",
  ""So, obviously, India is a very attractive market."",
  ""I'm not saying that that's what we would do."",
  ""But we think that we could move pretty quickly in India if the value proposition makes sense with Shalby."",
  ""So, that's what I would say for OUS domestically."",
  ""Our plan is we're targeting five sites initially, so that would be So, it's going to be a mix, but we haven't provided any guidance yet on where we see revenue in 2026."",
  ""But we think we'll be in a – we think, put it like this, I think we have a market."",
  ""I think we're going to have a problem of meeting demand and kind of less trying to drive interest."",
  ""I think we'll have a problem where we won't be able to fulfill demand."",
  ""But we'll see when the time comes."",
  ""So, that's why we're going to Arab Health in January."",
  ""So, when you look at some of these large markets, like, for example, you take Indonesia, which is a massive population, there's a bunch of pretty attractive markets in South America."",
  ""We think parts of even the Middle East, Eastern – Far East Turkey."",
  ""If you look at where CUREXO has done really well, we think that they have kind of blazed the trail in terms of markets that are attractive for robotic adoption."",
  ""So, those are some of the areas that would be a focus for us outside the United States."",
  ""And we're going to start attending trade shows that'll help us build the relationships we need to launch in some of those markets."",
  ""So, the biggest cost saving for any robotic system is, well, it really is the clinical value proposition of the robotic system."",
  ""So, the reason that one out of two robots will be robotic by 2030 is because certain types of robotics have actually changed the surgery, fundamentally changed it."",
  ""So, Mako uses a CT scan as the preoperative information to basically generate a personalized custom surgical plan for that patient."",
  ""And they're one of the few robot companies in the world that use a CT scan."",
  ""And what Mako has shown is that if surgeons personalize the surgery, that seems to enhance the patient satisfaction outcomes, surgical outcomes."",
  ""So, it's not a surprise that a one size fits none approach to surgery and giving everybody the same knee doesn't really cut it."",
  ""What Mako has shown is that if you customize the surgery, patient outcomes seem to be enhanced."",
  ""So, that if you think about it in a very competitive landscape where orthopedic surgeries, joint reconstructions are highly profitable surgeries for hospitals, the ability to have a robotic system that enables a surgery to be executed seamlessly without risk, with minimal learning curve, kind of plug it in and the surgeon's efficient from day one kind of thing that could be very valuable to a hospital."",
  ""So, the most real fundamental value proposition from a cost saving is just it's really – it's the marketing side of it."",
  ""It's enabling surgeries that makes a clinical difference."",
  ""And then it's when you think about kind of the long tail risks of surgery, adverse outcomes, cutting an MCL cutting of a patellar tendon, doing something bad, a system that really mitigates those risks, drives a lot of cost savings."",
  ""So that'll be the first thing."",
  ""The second thing I would say is right out of the gate our system is going to be – it's going to be hard for us to be competitive."",
  ""When you look at the unit economics of just our consumables, as we're getting scale, it's going to be obviously we're going to be at a disadvantage versus our peers in terms of buying and getting kind of the realizing efficiencies of volume."",
  ""But we do have some advantages."",
  ""So, for example, the Mako system requires a toolchain."",
  ""So, to do the posterior cut and the distal femur cut with the Mako system, you need a right-angle adapter."",
  ""And what a lot of surgeons will do is they will preload that adapter with a blade."",
  ""So the surgeon will start the surgery, switch the blade, switch the other tool, that tool will be preloaded, and sometimes even a rep will preload the tool that was used with a different tool."",
  ""So, you could use three blades in a single case."",
  ""And I can tell you that those blades are not cheap with our pricing analysis."",
  ""So, Monogram System is just a – there's no tool change."",
  ""It's just one blade per procedure."",
  ""So, we see some economic advantages there."",
  ""Pretty much everybody is using similar fiducials to navigate the knee and other instrumentation."",
  ""So, there's not a huge opportunity there."",
  ""But as we think about kind of the next gen and where it's going, we think there's certainly opportunities to potentially eliminate the fiducials, the consumable and lower cost."",
  ""Then you think about cost savings, it's also just efficiency in time, right?"",
  ""So, the faster you could do a surgery, the more your robot increases throughput, the more competitive it is and kind of a head-to-head matchup."",
  ""So, we think our robot is certainly competitive, especially as we have scale and more purchasing power, but clinically speaking is where we think the rubber meets the road."",
  ""So, if you think about a large strategic and you think about the servicing cost to kind of manage a deployed robot base, right."",
  ""So, for some of some companies in the space, they have thousands of robots that they have to manage and service and calibrate and take care of."",
  ""If your robot is only optimized for a single application, let's say total knee, but it's not optimized for hip or shoulder or whatever, that becomes very inefficient."",
  ""So, we think that over time as we become multi-application having, let's call it a best- in-class piece of hardware that scales to other clinical applications will be a significant cost savings for just from a distribution standpoint and servicing standpoint, training standpoint, cross-training, robot operators on multiple applications."",
  ""There's all kinds of interesting synergies."",
  ""So, a long-winded way of saying we think we have some advantages."",
  ""But one of the – so one of the advantages of our system is that we kind of – the training required to be an expert in our system or the learning curve we think is going to be very fast."",
  ""So, we think the number of cases required to learn how to use the system is minimal."",
  ""To just kind of give you some examples."",
  ""So, as part of our verification validation, when we submitted to the FDA, we had to have surgeons come in and use the system."",
  ""Many of the surgeons that came in had never used the system and we took them from a quick training session to doing surgery on a cadaver and the data for accuracy and all sorts of protocols that were being run So, that's how much confidence we have in the system."",
  ""And we think that training is – the required training for the fully autonomous version is pretty minimal."",
  ""There really is minimal skill required to execute the cuts."",
  ""So, I don't think – I don't know, Larry, if you were – I don't think you were there, but we did – we had an Analyst Day not too long ago."",
  ""And at the Analyst Day, we actually had So, all of the cutting was done by a 13-year-old girl who didn't know anything about a knee replacement."",
  ""So, we're really going to get to the point where the surgeon is just sort of like autopilot on a plane, telling the plane where to go and the plane kind of takes off, flies and lands pretty much its own."",
  ""Kind of a similar thing with our system."",
  ""The surgeon will tell the robot where it wants it to put the cuts."",
  ""But outside of that, it should be pretty intuitive."",
  ""So, we haven't disclosed what our target ASP is."",
  ""And it's going to be pretty variable."",
  ""And I should say that the market in the United States is changing."",
  ""It used to be that robot companies like Mako could charge $1 million per system."",
  ""What they've been transitioning to is more of a bundling where they offer hospitals and ASCs discounted pricing for use of the robotic system."",
  ""So, utilization drives economics for the hospital and they essentially give the robot away in exchange for use commitments."",
  ""So that's the direction the model is going."",
  ""And yes, it is a razor/razor blade model."",
  ""So the capital equipment can certainly be an attractive business."",
  ""But the money is made on the consumable which, in our case, the robot consumables and the implant consumables."",
  ""And we think that the – some companies in our space are doing a very, very good job monetizing the robot consumables in addition to the implant."",
  ""So, that's really where the money we think is going to be made is utilization of the system and selling the implant."",
  ""So, I mean, the reality is that even when we look at like, let's say COVID, which had a material impact on the knee reconstruction business and joint reconstruction, it wasn't that the demand went away, it was just that the demand got deferred."",
  ""People who need a knee replacement need a knee replacement."",
  ""And I think when you look at the biggest barrier to surgery, it's a very real fear that, frankly, I would have too of amputation."",
  ""I mean, once you kind of fully appreciate what's happening in a knee replacement, you're taking bone and you're cutting it in a way that is permanent."",
  ""That is a very scary thing."",
  ""And so, our goal is to try and over time turn knee replacements into Lasik surgery, right."",
  ""If we have a system that is very, very accurate, that requires minimal skill and that gives surgeons all the tools they need to carefully and appropriately plan where to put that implant so the patient has the highest likelihood of being satisfied and can execute that plan with minimal risk to the patient, we think that that's really the best we can do for the space and people who maybe are sitting on the sidelines not getting a knee replacement because it's elective and they're just kind of suffering through."",
  ""We really want to have a solution for those people to get their life back because when you when you get a knee replacement or a joint replacement and it goes well, I mean there's so many people that I've talked to that it's been game changing."",
  ""It's enhanced the quality of their life tremendously."",
  ""So, that's really our vision."",
  ""Our vision is to basically make knee replacements a surgery that is not so scary, is basically just almost on autopilot."",
  ""And part of part of what happens has to happen for that to be a reality is that the surgeons, just more surgeons need to use robotics."",
  ""And a lot of people will say, well, robotics haven't really proven anything clinically."",
  ""And that's true if you use a robot to just do what you could do with manual instruments right?"",
  ""If you just use a robot to do generic knee replacements, yeah, the value proposition isn't really that significant."",
  ""But if you use a robot to personalize the surgery and really in ways that are transformative, we think that's where the value proposition is starting to showcase itself."",
  ""So, hopefully, that helps address that."",
  ""So, I just want to thank everybody for joining us this afternoon."",
  ""The team has been working very, very hard to execute our objective."",
  ""And our objective is very clear, we want to commercialize the first fully autonomous saw-based cutting robot on the market."",
  ""And we believe that a solution like what we're building has an increasing market need."",
  ""We think the dynamics of the market are shifting very quickly."",
  ""We believe most younger surgeons coming onto the market use robotics and the predominant robot they use is MAKO."",
  ""And we think as you have the demographic trends kind of shift in the orthopedic space and more surgeons who can be used to doing things the old way retiring we think that the need for what Monogram is building is going to become more and more acute."",
  ""So, we think time is on our side and we're just going to continue putting our heads down and executing and doing everything we can to get clearance as quickly as possible."",
  ""So really, really  for your support."",
  ""We will be in touch with hopefully some updates over the coming months as we meet with the FDA and hopefully have additional news for our clinical trial."",
  ""So, Tom, I would say that was a – that's not an ongoing thing."",
  ""So, the marketing expense was largely to drive awareness of the campaign and the marketing spend has really been materially reduced since that was closed."",
  ""I will say... One thing I'll just say kind of a nice synergy out of it that I think is I think is a little bit underappreciated."",
  ""So, I just want to kind of highlight the some of the value propositions of our system, potential value propositions."",
  ""One of the things we're really thinking a lot about is and the team is really devoted to, is having – we have an aspirational goal to have the most accurate system on the market."",
  ""Now, obviously, that would need to be clinically validated and this is just an aspirational goal."",
  ""But if that turns out, for example, to be the case, and we could demonstrate that, clinically speaking, our robot is very accurate we think that the marketing that's been spent to date over the life of the company will – it feels like we have somewhat of an intangible asset in our newsletter and in the audience that follows Monogram."",
  ""And we think that we will potentially have the ability to market our system in ways that could resonate with our audience."",

  ""Now, let's dive into the details of our financial results."",
  ""Total revenue of this quarter were RMB 1,885.6 million, reflecting a 16% year-over-year increase, of which revenue from public cloud services were RMB 1,175.5 million, up 15.6% from RMB 1,016.6 million in the same quarter last year."",

  ""Total cost of revenue was RMB 1,582.2 million, up 10.7% year-over-year, but remained stable quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""IDC cost dropped significantly by 8.7% year-over-year from RMB 737.7 million to RMB 673.8 million this quarter, reflecting the strategic scaling down of our CDN services and the batch rep utilization."",
  ""Depreciation and amortization costs increased from RMB 200.4 million in the same period of last year to RMB 297.5 million this quarter, mainly due to the depreciation of newly acquired GPU servers."",
  ""Solution development and services costs rose by 70.3% year-over-year from RMB 425.3 million to RMB 499 million, driven by expansion in Camelot personnel to support revenue growth."",
  ""Fulfillment costs and other costs were RMB 59.5 million and RMB 52.3 million this quarter, respectively."",
  ""Our adjusted gross profit for the quarter was RMB 307.6 million, a 56.7% increase year-over-year with an adjusted gross margin of 16.3%."",
  ""On the expenses side, excluding share-based compensation and impairment of long-lived assets, our total adjusted operating expenses were RMB 491.2 million, a decrease of 2.6% year-over-year and 11.5% quarter-over-quarter, of which our adjusted R&D expenses were RMB 232.3 million, up 16.1% from last quarter due to a higher personnel cost."",

  ""Our capital expenditure and assets obtained through a financial leasing reached RMB 1.22 billion, majority of which are used to invest in the servers to support AI business."",
  ""Looking ahead, we remain committed to the principles of high-quality and the sustainable development."",
  ""We expect ongoing revenue growth, driven by deeper collaborations with Xiaomi and the Kingsoft ecosystems, further expansion of the AI-related gross billings, and a continued reduction of low-margin CDN business."",
  ""We also expect to achieve another milestone on the adjusted operating profit in the near future."",
  ""This concludes our prepared remarks,  for your attention."",
  ""We are now happy to take your question."",
  ""Please ask your question in both Mandarin, Chinese and English, if possible.""
]","[
  ""So,  management for taking my questions and I've got two questions here."",
  ""So, first of all, on the revenue contribution from Xiaomi and Kingsoft group has been continuously increasing over the past quarters."",
  ""So, could you please share with us your views on the growth potentials of those strategic customers as well as your service strategy?"",
  ""And secondly, could you please share your outlook on adjusted EBITDA margin as well as operating margin, taking into consideration the depreciation and amortization expenses and the rising AI-related CapEx?"",
  "" management for taking my questions."",
  ""I have two questions here."",
  ""The first is regarding the margin profile of your AI band, as well as the revenue from Xiaomi and Kingsoft Group."",
  ""So, just wondering how the margin compares to the overall margin profile of public cloud."",
  ""And secondly, just wondering on your outlook for the CapEx for this year and next year and how we plan to utilize the resources either on the balance sheet or off balance sheet to meet the funding resources, demand to grow our business and especially the AI business?"",
  ""So, I will just very quickly translate what Mr. Zou said."",
  ""So, yes, you have seen the business opportunity is coming from the Xiaomi and Kingsoft ecosystem have been increasing very quickly and suddenly."",
  "" to the unprecedented AI opportunities since last year, since the AI opportunities and of course the business – the AI-related business opportunities we have with Xiaomi and Kingsoft Corporation has been developing fairly fast."",
  ""As you would have seen from the Xiaomi results released yesterday, which we felt to be historically strongest result."",
  ""The Xiaomi EV delivery has been very strong, so therefore the cloud service utilization and use cases centered around the growth of Xiaomi has a solid foundation for growth."",
  ""And also, I have mentioned that on the WPS office side, where they have been centered around AI capabilities to promote new AI-related functions as well as the solid growth in key customers for AI function and these all have been driving the cloud usage on the cloud side, which is our revenue."",
  ""So, the conclusion is, with the solid growth of the Xiaomi and Kingsoft ecosystem, their business laid solid foundation for the revenue growth and for the business opportunity of Kingsoft Cloud and we believe that we are still in this very good business momentum to further growth."",
  ""Probably I will comment on the second question regarding the margin expansion."",
  ""So, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the sequencing we are seeing is our continued expansion from the gross margin to the EBITDA margin then dropped to the operating profit."",
  ""So, back in 2022, at the time our gross margin was as little as only around 3%, and this quarter reaching to a certain level, we think is getting even closer to the top-tier player in the market in terms of the gross margin in the near-term."",
  ""And for the EBITDA margin, you can also notice that the EBITDA margin has converted from a loss of 8.6% in Q2 2022 to a positive around 10% this quarter."",
  ""And I think the speed of expansion of EBITDA margin will be faster than the gross margin expansion."",
  ""And in addition, I think our EBITDA margin, given the AI, has already contributed around one-third of the total company revenue, which is also higher than the major peers on the Street."",
  ""And I think given that reason, our EBITDA margin will continue to deliver a much higher expansion and speed compared with the peers of the industry as well."",
  ""So, in addition, as you speak about the operating margin, as you'll notice our expenses control and the cost cutting in terms of operations as well as improving the efficiency in our operations, all contributed to the operating line as well."",
  ""So, I think we're hoping for the near-term we can deliver a positive surprise to the shareholders you may see accelerated and a significant improvement of the operating profit in the very near-term and hopefully we can keep that track after we made a breakeven in the near-term."",
  ""But at this moment, we're not providing formal guidance for the time being, but hopefully we can keep the speed and expansion from the gross margin to EBITDA and then to the operating profit as a trend you may observe."",
  ""So, happy to take on those two questions."",
  ""The first question, as you know, we are not disclosing the separate line of gross margin for each of the product line, given as you know, sometimes each customer, they may use more different business segments, so it's a bit difficult to separate that, but happy to provide some high-level guidance on that."",
  ""Overall, the AI-related computing-related products are delivering much higher gross margin compared with the traditional public cloud services, including the traditional storage and networking and our entire public cloud gross margin is higher than enterprise cloud in most cases."",
  ""But, however, as Mr. Zou also mentioned in his prepared remarks, the reason why this quarter we're delivering much stronger and robust top line growth as well as the margin expansion is, our both public cloud and the enterprise cloud have achieved double-digit Y-o-Y growth, which is unlike other peers on the market, because we actually did our business strategy adjustment much earlier back in two years ago."",
  ""So, we do see both parallel growth driver has been very solid for this quarter."",
  ""So, coming back to your margin question, I think if we want to a pecking order, the different pipelines, I think the current revenue contribution for the incremental revenue, especially the AI deliver double-digit gross margin and a double-digit EBITDA margin and the traditional public cloud also deliver a decent gross margin as well."",
  ""But when you look at the EBITDA margin, I think the AI is also delivering very good margin as well."",
  ""Our traditional non-public cloud services, especially from the CDN, as you know, we have already planned out the scaling down as planned, which we actually executed very effectively."",
  ""So, the margin contribution from CDN has been very effective and well on our budget, also delivered very in line of the budget."",
  ""So, these are the first question I probably want to mention."",
  ""The second part is, given the CapEx, I think the one part I want to mention is, we actually have already secured many of the additional CapEx resources, including the banks, financial leasing companies, as well as the state-owned enterprises, which actually can cooperate with us to invest together into the GPU and AI investments."",
  ""But more importantly, as I mentioned also in my prepared remarks, for the next three years, we are currently applying for the cap of the related party transaction from both Xiaomi and Kingsoft around RMB 11.3 billion for the next three years, which is about 10 times over this year's number."",
  ""So, from that budget, we are going to look into more closer financial support from shareholders and we are confident we will not dilute the public shareholders in terms of the additional share issuance or the potential transactions that may be dilutive to the public shareholders, well, keep that in mind."",
  ""And the strong support from both business and CapEx from the major two shareholders will be very important for our company growth as well as the margin expansion and the robust financial position for the next few years and we have our internal discussion from the annual budget meeting as well."",
  ""I think we will talk about that in the later quarter and you may find that we'll maintain a very robust way to managing both leverage as well as the investment speed to the AI investment."",
  "" once again for joining us today."",
  ""If you have any further questions, please feel free to contact IR team."",
  ""Look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.""

  ""If I may direct you, first of all, to page 2 on the agenda."",
  ""I will comment on the progress we've made during the first half of the financial year."",
  ""Mark will then run through the numbers and Jim as usual will update on the commercial strategy and the progress thereon."",
  ""Before I hand it back to myself, we've got an update on strategy and operational performance and then we will open up to Q&A. Before we start turning to pages on the slide deck, I just want to recap on what has been an extremely strong first half for the business and briefly update you on several topics that are frequently coming up in our meetings with shareholders, analysts, and other stakeholders."",
  ""Our financial performance has been strong and we've made further progress in delivering on our strategy."",
  ""I would particularly like to highlight our continued rapid growth in the poultry sector."",
  ""Later in the presentation, we'll talk you through our newly committed expansion project to increase fresh poultry volumes processed through our existing Eye facility."",
  ""However, in terms of a larger expansion, planning still remains a challenge."",
  ""If we wish to grow our poultry business in East Anglia, we need more than just the warm words we've heard from government prior to their election."",
  ""We are yet to see any evidence of real change to the bureaucratic and overly complex planning application process, and we need this both simplifying and streamlining."",
  ""The impact of the government's budget creates yet another unhelpful inflationary headwind that we will now need to manage."",
  ""We've done this, as you will recall for many recent years with great success, and we will be looking to mitigate the impact through efficiency measures and optimal capacity utilization."",
  ""The combined impact of the increased national insurance contributions and the further increase to the national living wage was not expected."",
  ""The time now available to put in place mitigating actions is somewhat limited."",
  ""Ultimately, we do expect cost increases will have to be passed on to customers to some extent."",
  ""And Jim will talk about this more later on."",
  ""On a more positive note, we are seeing improved engagement from the government in relation to discussions with China and the reinstatement of our Norfolk site export license."",
  ""You will recall that we voluntarily suspended our export license in October 2020 following advice received from DEFRA at that time."",
  ""Finally, before we turn the pages on the presentation, I would remind you all that the competitive landscape remains tough."",
  ""We operate within arguably the world's most competitive food retailing sector."",
  ""Our competitors set in both pork and poultry is well consolidated and ambitious to grow and gain market share."",
  ""Despite these challenges, we continue to win and grow in all these categories both pork, poultry, Mediterranean and our pet food operations."",
  ""We continue to invest at pace in our asset base with a focus on the long-term, delivering industry leading levels of service, quality and innovation to our customers."",
  ""Now, if I may direct your attention, please, to page 4 of the slide deck."",
  ""We've made substantial progress in delivering on our strategy in the first half of this financial year."",
  ""We've delivered strong revenue growth of over 6%, reflecting volume growth across our UK food and pet food businesses."",
  ""Our poultry revenues increased by 16.4% and now represents almost 20% of group sales."",
  ""Operating margin increased to 7.5%."",
  ""This demonstrates the impact of delivering our vertical integration strategy in pig farming and feed milling, where our pig production has increased by 18% year-on-year."",
  ""Investment across our asset base has continued at pace with £48 million deployed in the first half of the year."",
  ""As I mentioned a moment ago, we are today, announcing a new commitment to expand our processing capacity and the associated supply chain for our Eye facility based out in Suffolk."",
  ""Combined with the ongoing projects at our value added poultry sites in Hull, we now have £47 million worth of investment in progress across our poultry divisions."",
  ""We'll go into more detail on the impact of these projects later in the presentation."",
  ""On page 5, the financial metrics on this page demonstrate that we've delivered another record performance in the half and that we continued to deliver our ambitious growth plans with discipline."",
  ""I've already highlighted the strong volume led revenue growth and improved operating margins."",
  ""The adjusted earnings per share was 17.7% ahead of the same period last year."",
  ""And our cash generation has been extremely strong."",
  ""Our leverage remains extremely low and our return on capital employed has improved to 18.7% as we continue to effectively deploy capital at pace."",
  ""We are also increasing our interim dividend by just over 10% to £0.25 per share."",
  ""On page 6 and before I move on to Mark's presentation, these record results have been delivered well by the exceptional people that that we are working with."",
  ""I would say that we've got a monopoly on the best people in the industry."",
  ""The quality, the strength of character, and the capability of our teams is what enables Cranswick to keep delivering."",
  ""And I thank them all for their continued commitment."",
  ""It is a major focus of mine to maintain our culture of autonomy and empowerment, together with our focus on people development throughout the business."",
  ""As our workforce exceeds 15,000 people, it is these key strengths that enables us to engage with, attract, and retain industry leading talent."",
  ""Building on this area of our competitive advantage will support Cranswick success for the long term."",
  ""I'll now hand over to Mark to cover the first half of the financials."",
  ""And if I just directly to page 21 and I'll just go into a bit more detail on the investments that we're making across the poultry operations and also the pig farming activities."",
  ""And then wrapping it up and handing over to Q&A. Commencing in the second half of this year, we'll be investing a further £20 million in total across our fresh poultry operations."",
  ""£7 million of this will be an incubatory capacity at our Kenninghall site in East Anglia."",
  ""This will reduce reliance on third parties and enable an increase in the birds being produced."",
  ""It's also worth noting that the move to lower stocking densities across the poultry farms is progressing to plan and we are maintaining our high We will deliver fresh poultry sales growth together with yield improvements, labor efficiencies, and a further capacity optimization."",
  ""The £27 million of investment across the breaded and ready to eat poultry site is already in progress and both projects are expected to be largely complete by the end of the current financial year."",
  ""These projects will add additional cooking and cooling capacity and enable further range expansion, including full roasted birds and bone-in portions."",
  ""As Jim called out earlier, these investments in added value poultry facilitate delivery of a significant new listing, with Marks & Spencer being the premium retailer in this case."",
  ""This is due to come on-stream from the quarter four of this year."",
  ""Combined, this £47 million of investment will drive continued growth across the poultry product ranges, delivering the quality convenience and value that consumers look for in this premium category."",
  ""As we've mentioned, we continued to grow the pig farming and pig feed milling operations at pace."",
  ""Through acquisition and organic investment, we've increased our pig production by 18% year-on-year."",
  ""We've increased the What's interesting to note here, we are actually producing about 2,200 pigs a year more than we would have done on a like-for-like basis as an improvement from the productivity improvements that we've made across the year."",
  ""Just 11 years ago, we weren't farming any pigs at all, and we now have the largest pig farming business in the UK, producing over 34,000 finished pigs per week in addition to our substantial poultry farming activities and this investment will continue."",
  ""Through this investment in the farm and supply chains across both pork and poultry, we're driving significant margin progression, enabling improved animal welfare and strengthening relationships with our strategic customers."",
  ""I see the expansion of the farming operations as being critical to our long term growth plans."",
  ""I expect that to be further sector consolidation going forward, potentially fueled even more by the impact of the recent budget."",
  ""We'll continue to look at opportunities to grow the scale and quality of our agricultural supply chains."",
  ""And on page 23 and in summary and on the outlook."",
  ""Trading in the first half of the year has been strong."",
  ""We've delivered volume led growth and strengthened our operating margin."",
  ""We now enter our key trading period at Christmas."",
  ""We have substantial capital investment pipeline with returns enhancing projects across poultry, pork, Mediterranean, foods, and farming operations."",
  ""And we will, of course, continue to deploy this capital at pace across the business."",
  ""As I said before, the Christmas order book is strong, probably the strongest I've ever experienced."",
  ""I'm delighted to once again be presenting another strong set of half year results."",
  ""I will take you through our financial performance before handing on to Jim, who will provide more commercial and market context to the numbers."",
  ""Now turning to page 8 of the slide deck and recapping on Adam's comments."",
  ""We've made strong progress in delivering our strategy."",
  ""On the financial highlights on this page show that we have delivered a record first half with a strong performance across all metrics."",
  ""Year-on-year, revenue is up 6.1%, adjusted PBT is 17.4% higher and EPS and DPS of 17.7% and 10.1% higher respectively."",
  ""Our cash conversion has also been excellent with our free cash flow increasing by 34.6% and our net debt excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities falling to just £0.9 million."",
  ""Now looking at the numbers a little bit more detail on page 9, I'll quickly run through the headline numbers before looking at each in turn in more detail on the following pages."",
  ""Reported revenue was up 6.1% to £1,329.9 million with like-for-like revenue growth a touch lower at 5.8%, reflecting the pass through models of a lower pig price."",
  ""Adjusted gross margin was 121 basis points higher at 15.3%."",
  ""Adjusted operating profit increased by 16.5% to £99.6 million, and operating margin at 7.5% was 67 basis points higher."",
  ""Adjusted profit before tax at £95.8 million was 17.4% ahead with the effective tax rate at 26.2% compared to 26.1% in the previous half year."",
  ""And consequently, adjusted EPS increased by 17.7% to £1.321, reflecting the growth in adjusted profit before tax figure."",
  ""As Adam mentioned, we are proposing to increase the interim dividend by £0.023 or 10.1% to £0.25 per share, up from £0.227 per share last year."",
  ""And this leaves us well placed to extend to 35 years of sequence of unbroken dividend growth."",
  ""Return on capital employed is also extremely strong, increasing by 234 basis points to 18.7%, compared to 16.4% in H1 last year."",
  ""The increase in return on capital employed reflects our ability to deploy capital at pace to drive strong returns and we have a strong pipeline of strategic projects ongoing that I will discuss in more detail later in the presentation."",
  ""Now turning on to page 10 and looking at revenue in more detail."",
  ""We've delivered a strong volume led revenue growth of 6.1%."",
  ""Volumes are ahead by 7.3% with strong momentum – the strong momentum generated in quarter one continuing through quarter two."",
  ""As this revenue bridge shows, we've seen underlying market growth in all categories supported by strong promotional activity from our retail customers and increasing demand for premium categories."",
  ""Our core pork and poultry product ranges are well aligned."",
  ""Current consumer preference is driven by the quality, convenience, versatility and value of our products."",
  ""Jim will come on to cover specific category performance in more detail later."",
  ""We've also delivered growth ahead of the market with market share gains a key driver of revenue growth in the period."",
  ""This demonstrates that our strategy and focus on our key strengths, including maintaining our industry leading asset infrastructure, product quality and unrivaled service levels continues to drive excellent results."",
  ""Our further progress in fresh and other value poultry has been strong with revenues up by 16.4% and with poultry revenue now accounting for 19.5% of total group sales."",
  ""We also delivered strong growth in pet food with revenues up by 71.1%, reflecting the successful ongoing rollout of the Pets at Home contract."",
  ""The net impacted price mix reflects Now turning to slide 11 and looking at margin in more detail."",
  ""Compared to H1 FY 2024, we've seen another step up in gross margin and this has continued to drop through to operating margin."",
  ""Year-on-year, operating margin was 67 basis points higher at 7.5%."",
  ""As this slide demonstrates, we've now delivered five consecutive halves of improvement in operating margin."",
  ""We have delivered this through the continued successful integration and expansion of our pig farming supply chains, together with closer alignment to our key customers, delivery of strong volume growth with excellent capacity utilization, and continued focus on tight cost control across the business."",
  ""Moving on to page 12 and looking at cash flow now."",
  ""Strong free cash flow of £105.4 million with free cash conversion of 110.9% is a great result and demonstrates the quality and discipline with which we continue to deliver growth ahead of our medium-term target."",
  ""Our strong free cash generation enables ongoing reinvestment across our industry leading asset base and continuation of our progressive dividend policy whilst maintaining a strong balance sheet."",
  ""Net debt, excluding IFRS 16 lease liabilities was just £0.9 million versus £51 million at September 2023."",
  ""Expansion in lease liabilities to £106.6 million versus £90.9 million as at September 2023 reflects growth in our agricultural operations and the prevalence of leased farm sites, particularly in poultry."",
  ""On a reported basis, net debt increased by £8.1 million to £107.5 million, from £99.4 million at 30th of March 2024."",
  ""And looking at more detail in the building blocks, as you can see, the strong EBITDA related inflow of £142.4 million."",
  ""Working capital outflow, including biological assets, was £18.7 million in the period as usual for our interim results, this outflow reflected the strategic inventory build ahead of Christmas."",
  ""Tax paid in the period of £20.6 million was £2.3 million, lower than the £22.9 million paid in H1 last year."",
  ""In H1 last year, there was a catchup of £5.1 million relating to previous year's estimates."",
  ""And interest paid was just £1.2 million, which was £0.8 million lower than H1 last year."",
  ""Over the last seven and a half years, we've generated over £1.1 billion of free cash flow."",
  ""Over this period, we spent well over £600 million on CapEx, £177 million on complementary M&A. And we returned almost £240 million to shareholders by way of dividend."",
  ""In terms of our banking facility, we have a £250 million sustainability-linked facility, which extends through to November 2026."",
  ""We have the option to access a further £50 million on the same terms with the facility providing generous headroom to continue delivering our growth strategy."",
  ""Now, I mentioned I was going to talk about CapEx in a little bit more detail and you can see this on slide 14."",
  ""We've invested a further £47.7 million across our asset base to support the further growth and drive operating efficiencies."",
  ""And we've made good progress on the three capacity enhancing projects, with £20 million spent in the first half."",
  ""These projects include the ongoing £25 million fit out of the Worsley houmous facility, where production of Ramona's houmous and dips range has now been successfully transferred with more capacity set to come on-stream later in the year, providing more headroom for growth."",
  ""The £62 million multi-phased investment program at our Hull pork primary processing facility is progressing as planned as is the £27 million expansion of the two added value Hull poultry sites on track to start onboarding a large new retail contract towards the end of Q4."",
  ""Adam will talk you through this in more detail shortly."",
  ""But we have now committed to a further £20 million investment project to add significant processing capacity at our existing Eye fresh poultry site and increase incubatory capacity at our Kenninghall site."",
  ""In total, we now have £47 million of investment ongoing across our added value and fresh poultry operations that will drive further growth in poultry."",
  ""Investment in automation projects and in our agricultural supply chain also continues at pace across the business, driving improvements in efficiencies and farm productivity whilst creating further capacity for future growth."",
  ""And I'm reconfirming FY 2025 CapEx guidance of circa £100 million, although given how many growth projects are now in the pipeline, I do see some upside risk to this guidance."",
  ""So, to summarize before handing over to Jim."",
  ""We've delivered a strong revenue growth of 6.1%, underpinned by 7.3% volume growth."",
  ""Adjusted profit before tax increased by 17.4% and adjusted earnings per share by 17.7%."",
  ""Increased operating margin reflects a strong contribution from our growing pig farming operations, excellent capacity utilization and tight cost control."",
  ""Our strong free cash generation track record continues and our balance sheet remains in very robust shape."",
  ""We have a strong pipeline of earnings enhancing investment projects and have delivered a return on capital employed of 18.7% in the first half."",
  ""And finally, we are increasing our interim dividend by 10.1%."",
  ""I'll now hand over to Jim, who will update you on our commercial progress."",
  ""I'm going to keep it fairly brief for the half year, but in the usual format I'll cover off the retail and out-of-home consumption trends, inflation and the impact on our operational costs, and Cranswick's performance in the commercial outlook."",
  ""So initially, if I can draw your attention to page 16, you will see and also well documented elsewhere, that the total fresh and chilled market grew by 4.1%, with still some inflation in the system, but reflecting volume growth underlying of 2.3%."",
  ""In fact, October trading saw the highest level of retail sales since the panic buying of the pandemic."",
  ""Tesco and Sainsbury's are continuing to perform well, driving the largest cash growth in Tesco and fresh and chilled with Tesco up 6.2% and Sainsbury's respectively up 8.1%."",
  ""They've delivered value for consumers through the Aldi price match schemes and strong promotions delivered with either Clubcard or Nectar deals, reducing essentially consumers drive to move their sales to the discounters."",
  ""At the same time, though, they've offered more choice, quality and innovation and have driven the premium brands extremely well with a differentiated offer within the finest and taste the difference brands."",
  ""And The discounters continue to make progress, but this is now all driven by Lidl, with Aldi now actually falling behind the market in terms of growth."",
  ""It's actually worthy of mention here as well that Lidl's trading intensity per square foot or per store remains below that of Aldi, leaving them with some latent growth potential on a store-by-store basis."",
  ""Moving on to the out-of-home market, and this is a segment that is still struggling."",
  ""It's been disproportionately affected by inflation in the key raw materials, then labor, energy."",
  ""And it's a time, of course, when consumers have been cash constrained."",
  ""The latest announcements on So, if I can move you over on to page 17 and just looking at some of the key commodities, particularly on wheat and soya, which are the principal input costs of pig and chicken production."",
  ""You'll see here that both commodities have settled considerably and are now actually trending downwards."",
  ""Chicken pricing is generally directly linked to these commodity prices through trackers and open book models."",
  ""Whereas within pig meat, there is actually a mixture of cost of production and traditional supply and demand SPP related contracts or indeed even contracts with a blend of the two mechanisms."",
  ""So, with regards to pig pricing, you'll see that the pig price is trending downwards, yet it's a slower rate than the commodities."",
  ""This increases the profitability on farms."",
  ""You'll also note an expanding gap between the UK and EU pricing."",
  ""Throughout the period, retail prices have increased -- increased across the On the other hand, we are going to see significant headwinds in both the manufacturing and retail sectors through the change in the threshold of national insurance, the rights of employers, national insurance, and also significant rise in the national living wage."",
  ""So moving over on to page 18 and you'll see generally a very good sets of results across all our categories, with sales up 6.1% and strong overall volume growth of 7.3% delivered."",
  ""In fresh pork, retail volumes have been strong and despite a relatively tight pig supply pool, we've actually managed to increase the number of pigs we've processed across the three primary processing sites."",
  ""The convenience market has been a bit trickier, with lower demand and poorer weather impacting cooked and country meat sales at market level in the summer and inflation driven by a poor harvest in the olives and antipasti market further weighing on volumes."",
  ""Despite all this, we have actually gained share overall and managed to keep value in growth."",
  ""The slow cooked and seaweed ranges also continue to grow as this supports in-home dining occasion I mentioned earlier."",
  ""Gourmet business has done extremely well."",
  ""Sausage volumes well up on the previous year with our premium volumes growing well ahead of the average."",
  ""In gourmet bacon, similar trend continues and also a major category relaunch with our largest customer helping volumes there."",
  ""We've gained additional share of volume with the UK's largest QSR operator later in the period, as well as continuing to grow sales in the retail space of the cooked bacon and sausage facility."",
  ""And the pastry business also done very well with excellent new products over the summer and a major gastro launch with Tom Kerridge early in the autumn."",
  ""Poultries performed exceptionally strongly with a record number of birds processed on the fresh side, strong retail sales as we've taken a larger share of our key customers volume as well as a return to growth of This is to drive our value position ahead of volume with growth coming from these value added categories."",
  ""In pet, we've grown volumes extremely well on the back of our partnership with Pets."",
  ""Not only have volumes grown nearly 48%, but you can see the quality of sales coming through with our value sales up by 70%."",
  ""Moving on to revenue by channels and you can see very much in line with those market conditions."",
  ""Retail has been our strongest growth area, up 9% year-on-year."",
  ""And despite the market headwinds, we've actually still managed to grow our food service business."",
  ""Export remains challenging but still represents a very important parts of the value chains, and volumes actually have still increased by about 7.5% due to that increased scale I mentioned earlier."",
  ""So finally, if I move you over on to page 19 with regards to the commercial outlook."",
  ""We've seen a solid performance in our retail business and we are confident that demand for our products will remain resilient."",
  ""The fundamentals of this solid performance from the retailers and most notably the point that Cranswick Christmas 2024 looks pretty strong with a long lead into the big day and very easy for shoppers to access products in the lead up to Christmas and our order books looking pretty positive in terms of the pre-buys and things we are aware of."",
  ""Moving on to next year's commercial performance and the key feature will of course be managing the labor I mentioned earlier that will also be reflected in any pricing reviews there."",
  ""We have also deepened our strategic relationship with our key customers with more agricultural supply chains being aligned to specific customers and product ranges."",
  ""For example, we are using our bespoke genetics for improved eating quality for a premium range with a new breed of pig with higher marbling, delivering on taste and tenderness and initial results are showing a significant improvement in sales."",
  ""We've brought on new business throughout the year with new business wins which will annualize into next years probably are out-turn, as well as extending contracts with some of the group's largest customers."",
  ""And moving onto market, share gains, as well as developing the group into some new markets, the Ramona's brand, for example, has had a standout year with volume growth of around 80%."",
  ""And this is now the largest hummus brand in terms of both value and volume."",
  ""We've increased product ranges and distribution throughout the year and the product has now been produced at the new Worsley site, which will be fully commissioned in Q4 with the arrival of yet more and larger equipment."",
  ""We have a major new contracts on the way for our cooked and ready to eat chicken factory from the start of Q1, next year, which will be a step change in volume and that is supported by further investment in capacity and capability, which completes early in calendar 2025."",
  ""And finally, a new product range, we just launched with Pets, which will again help to""

18,3119389,1044MN-E,2024-12-17,"[
  "" for joining us today, and welcome to Amentum's  call."",
  ""This is an exciting moment for us, as we embark on a new chapter."",
  ""And I want to start by expressing my gratitude to the new Amentum team."",
  ""I am proud of their dedication, expertise and preparation that made this milestone possible."",
  ""Together, we have set a new course for the future of our business."",
  ""Before getting started, let me first outline our agenda and key topics that we will cover on today's call."",
  ""To kick off, I'll provide an overview of Amentum, including our differentiated position within the market and the incredible advantages of our transformative merger."",
  ""Next, I'll highlight key metrics related to our fiscal 2024 performance, then speak in depth about our growth opportunities and strategic priorities."",
  ""And lastly, I'll provide thoughts on the evolving industry dynamics before passing the call to Travis to discuss our financial results in more detail."",
  ""Amentum is a global leader in advanced engineering and technology, trusted to deliver mission-critical solutions, with roots deeply tied to a legacy of operational excellence."",
  ""Through one of the largest mergers in our industry's history, we created a sector leader with unique capabilities and a steadfast commitment to delivering critical solutions to our customers."",
  ""With impressive scale and a highly skilled and talented team of over 53,000 employees across over 80 countries, we are well placed to drive exceptional value and innovation in the industry."",
  ""You'll hear me talk a lot about our people, and it's because I believe they are our greatest asset and a true differentiator."",
  ""Our team includes a robust network of engineers specializing in disciplines such as environmental, software, aerospace, computer and systems engineering, along with approximately 15,000 STEM professionals."",
  ""This deep and technical talent base provides the skills required to develop the comprehensive solutions our customers and their complex missions require."",
  ""In spending time traveling around the world, meeting with employees and customers, I've seen firsthand the innovative work we are doing, executing many of our customers' most critical projects."",
  ""And it gives me great confidence in the future that lies ahead for the new Amentum."",
  ""Underpinning this depth of technical expertise is a culture of innovation, supporting the growth of our people and capabilities, ensuring we continue to attract and retain the best talent in the industry."",
  ""I am also extremely grateful to have an exceptional leadership team working alongside me, leading the way forward."",
  ""I first want to take a moment to reflect back on the landmark multi-billion dollar merger with Jacobs' Critical Mission Solutions and Cyber and Intelligence units."",
  ""This transformative combination has created larger, more diversified company, poised to tackle the most complex global challenges."",
  ""And  to our team's exceptional effort, we were ready to execute from day one with a harmonized organizational structure and go-to-market platform."",
  ""On October 1, we celebrated this milestone by ringing the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, marking the public launch of the new Amentum."",
  ""Looking ahead, our integration efforts are progressing well, and our teams have aligned well around shared goals and values, actively collaborating to unlock new areas of opportunity across the business."",
  ""Fiscal year 2024 results reflect the strength of our business and provide a solid foundation to start this next phase of our journey."",
  ""I'll touch on the headlines briefly here, and Travis will take you through a more detailed analysis later in the presentation."",
  ""We are pleased to report strong pro forma financial results above our Capital Markets Day expectations."",
  ""For the full year, we delivered revenues of $13.9 billion, representing 4% organic growth; and adjusted EBITDA of $1.05 billion, representing 7% year-over-year growth, driven by a 20 basis-point year-over-year margin improvement."",
  ""We ended fiscal year 2024 with $45 billion in backlog, representing 3.2 times annual revenue coverage."",
  ""Net bookings totaled $12 billion, which further underscores the strength of our end markets and the full lifecycle solutions we provide for our diverse base of customers."",
  ""To demonstrate Amentum's depth and breadth of advanced engineering and technology solutions expertise, I'd like to highlight a few recent awards."",
  ""First, Amentum was awarded a task order to deliver microelectronics capabilities to the U.S. Navy through the IAC-MAC award vehicle."",
  ""For years, Amentum has focused on cutting-edge RDT&E programs for customers like DARPA."",
  ""By growing our base of technical experts, combining advanced sensor networks with model-based systems engineering to develop next-generation systems, we are driving strong demand from defense customers."",
  ""And because these capabilities are in high demand, we see opportunities to capture new work with a broad set of customers."",
  ""Second, the U.S. Department of Energy awarded the Hanford Integrated Tank Disposition Contract, a 10-year $45 billion single-award IDIQ to a joint venture partnership which includes Amentum."",
  ""This award is an excellent example of Amentum's long history and extensive experience bringing advanced technical solutions to safely manage waste and advance our country's most complex cleanup missions."",
  ""Third, we secured a position on the UK's Hypersonic Technologies and Capabilities Development Framework, drawing on our success delivering value to US defense customers through digital engineering solutions."",
  ""This work will support the creation of a UK hypersonic capability."",
  ""This is another example of what Amentum is seeking to replicate, leveraging expertise gained from delivering solutions to customers in one part of our business and win business in an adjacent government, commercial or international market."",
  ""On the commercial side, Amentum was awarded contracts of more than $1 billion in fiscal year 2024 to support a variety of Fortune 500 customers in areas including advanced product research and development, next-gen wireless network design and optimization, critical infrastructure management and clean energy solutions such as support for small modular reactors, or SMRs."",
  ""To bring it all together, our scale, diversity and deep customer relationships give us a competitive advantage to win in the US and internationally."",
  ""This unique positioning, in particular our end market diversification, ensures we have a strong foundation to navigate changing market environments."",
  ""We have identified several key areas where the end-to-end solution capabilities, unlocked through the merger, strategically align the new Amentum with megatrends and customer priorities."",
  ""Together, we have increased our ability to deliver mission-critical support across a wider scope of customer offerings."",
  ""This broader range of advanced engineering and technology solutions, supported by our multi-disciplined engineering centers of excellence, enables us to expand our pipeline of large enterprise contracts and opens the door to growing addressable markets such as the energy transition and digital modernization."",
  ""We also see significant growth potential in new markets through existing capabilities, leveraging a successful track record of delivering critical engineering and technology solutions to customers in different industries."",
  ""This includes commercial opportunities where we can leverage large customers with growing needs, in many cases driven by next-gen infrastructure."",
  ""These white space opportunities, enhanced by Amentum's end-to-end capabilities, are areas that can support our future growth."",
  ""To build on the point of addressable market expansion, we also see an opportunity to accelerate international growth by leveraging security initiatives like AUKUS."",
  ""With a strong footprint in the US and a presence around the globe, including the UK and Australia, we are well positioned to pursue the largest and most important global contracts for the US and allied governments."",
  ""We also see a significant opportunity for growth through our portfolio of IDIQs."",
  ""Both Amentum and CMS had IDIQ vehicles, with contracts representing a combined $450 billion in contract sealing."",
  ""This strengthened position with more experienced capabilities and stronger customer relationships will enable us to expand our addressable market inside these IDIQs to accelerate revenue growth and enhance margins."",
  ""And finally, global megatrends provide a compelling backdrop for Amentum's continued success, shaped by several key accelerators."",
  ""An increasingly complex geopolitical landscape, including the rise of near-peer adversaries, is growing demand for critical solutions, particularly in defense and intelligence."",
  ""This rapid pace of technological advancement underscores the urgent need for modernization to ensure both the public and private sector can adapt."",
  ""Together, this will continue to drive strong customer demand for Amentum's core capabilities."",
  ""Let's turn now to slide 6 to discuss how Amentum is positioned to address recent developments following the election and the newly announced Department of Government Efficiency."",
  ""The incoming Trump administration has outlined plans to reduce waste, streamline processes, and modernize the federal government."",
  ""As you're all likely aware, the specifics of this plan are yet to be released."",
  ""But we believe this strategy focuses on creating efficiencies through innovation and technology, and therefore aligns well with Amentum's core strengths."",
  ""Amentum benefits from an industry-leading backlog position of $45 billion."",
  ""We have a diversified customer base across areas of critical importance, including international and commercial markets, which together account for approximately 20% of our revenues."",
  ""In the defense, intelligence and space markets, Amentum is delivering solutions that are well aligned with national security priorities."",
  ""In environment, we are providing engineering capabilities vital to addressing global environmental challenges in the energy transition."",
  ""In our civilian market, we provide highly complex solutions, critical to some of our government's most important functions."",
  ""This diversity and backlog positions Amentum well to adapt to shifting customer priorities."",
  ""Our ability to respond effectively to shifting customer needs is rooted in our expertise, combining technology-enabled engineering and mission critical performance."",
  ""We also have a successful track record across various contract types, including over $5 billion of revenues from fixed price and time and materials contracts."",
  ""Finally, it is important to note that Amentum benefits from a highly flexible cost structure and capital-light business model."",
  ""For all these reasons, we believe that Amentum is well positioned to navigate potential changes and to deliver impactful solutions that align with the administration's stated goals."",
  ""Before I hand it over to Travis, I want to emphasize that while it is early days as a public company, we are very pleased with our progress and believe we have set a strong foundation and culture for future growth."",
  ""Our priorities are clear, drive growth, leverage our expertise to meet evolving customer needs, and deliver long-term value for our stakeholders."",
  ""By focusing on this strategy, supporting our valuable, innovative and customer-focused culture, and executing effectively, we are well positioned to strengthen our market leadership and deliver long-term growth."",
  ""With that, I will hand it over to Travis, who will take you through the financials in more detail."",
  ""We hope you've had an opportunity to read the press release we issued yesterday afternoon, which is posted on our Investor Relations website."",
  ""We have also provided presentation slides to facilitate today's call."",
  ""So, let's move to slide 2."",
  ""Please note that this morning's discussion will contain forward-looking statements that are subject to important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from anticipated."",
  ""I refer you to our SEC filings for a discussion of these factors, including the Risk Factors section on our annual report on Form 10-K. The statements represent our views as of today, and subsequent events may cause our views to change."",
  ""We may elect to update the forward-looking statements at some point in the future, but specifically disclaim any obligation to do so."",
  ""In addition, we will discuss pro forma financial measures prepared in accordance with Article XI of Regulation S-X, as well as non-GAAP financial measures which we believe provide useful information for investors."",
  ""Both our press release and supplemental presentation slides include reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures."",
  ""These pro forma and non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP."",
  ""Our Safe Harbor statement included on this slide should be incorporated as part of any transcript of this call."",
  ""With me today to discuss our business and financial results are John Heller, Chief Executive Officer; and Travis Johnson, Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""We are also joined by other members of management, including Steve Arnette, Chief Operating Officer."",
  ""With that, moving to slide 3, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to our CEO, John Heller."",
  ""I'm pleased to discuss with you today Amentum's financial performance that reflects the strong momentum we are seeing across the business."",
  ""We're operating at the forefront of a dynamic market, and we are energized by the opportunities ahead for Amentum."",
  ""I look forward to keeping you updated on our progress as we execute our strategy and capitalize on an incredible opportunity to drive long-term value for our stakeholders."",
  ""Before diving into the details, I'd like to note that while our GAAP results provide an accounting view of Amentum's legacy business including CMS, today's discussion will focus on pro forma results."",
  ""These figures offer a combined view of the new Amentum business and will provide performance insight on a more comparable basis going forward."",
  ""Let's turn to slide 7, which highlights the strong fiscal year 2024 performance John mentioned earlier."",
  ""Pro forma results were above our Capital Markets Day expectation as a result of robust revenues of $13.9 billion, representing 4% organic growth."",
  ""The year-over-year increase was driven by the ramp-up of new programs and on-contract growth, partially offset by the expected wind-down of other historical programs."",
  ""Pro forma adjusted EBITDA was $1.05 billion, reflecting a 7% increase year-over-year and benefited from a 20 basis-point increase in adjusted EBITDA margin as a result of strong operational performance."",
  ""Fiscal year 2024 ending backlog was $45 billion, representing 3.2 times annual revenue coverage."",
  ""The pro forma book-to-bill was 0.8 times and excludes the Hanford contract John mentioned earlier, as well as over $2 billion of recompete awards that were under protest and over $23 billion of submitted bids awaiting award decision."",
  ""It is important to highlight that given Amentum's longer-than-average contract duration, book-to-bill can experience greater variability from recompete timing without impacting our revenue outlook."",
  ""Looking ahead, we expect to submit over $35 billion of bids in fiscal year 2025 and remain confident that our strong backlog and robust pipeline position us well to achieve our future growth objectives."",
  ""We continue to be excited about the prudent capital structure put in place through the well-received debt offering executed in connection with the merger."",
  ""We believe our balance sheet strength and strong liquidity position will help fuel continued growth as our priorities remain the same, driving sustainable growth while maintaining a disciplined approach to capital deployment."",
  ""With the earliest maturity in 2029, the offering solidified our capital structure over the next several years while, at the same time, allowing flexibility to pay down debt and meet our leverage objectives."",
  ""Fiscal year 2024 ending net leverage of 3.9 times, including the impact of expected run rate net cost synergies came in slightly better than expected."",
  ""We remain committed to prioritizing free cash flow to pay down debt and to achieving our target net leverage of approximately 3 times by the end of fiscal year 2026."",
  ""On slide 9, let's now discuss our fiscal year 2025 outlook."",
  ""I'll start by noting that the forecast was developed through a rigorous bottoms-up process, incorporating detailed program-by-program inputs from across the business and expectations for recompetes and new business on a specific opportunity basis."",
  ""We are affirming guidance provided at Capital Markets Day, including revenues in the range of $13.8 billion to $14.2 billion, and adjusted EBITDA between $1.06 billion to $1.1 billion."",
  ""Growth driven by new program awards and on-contract growth is expected to be partially offset by the wind-down of certain historical programs, including SciTech."",
  ""With only 8% of revenues expected to come from new business and with over $23 billion of submitted bids award awaiting decision, we have good line of sight and are confident in our position starting the fiscal year."",
  ""In addition, we are introducing adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share metrics as disclosed and defined in our press release and supplemental financial slides."",
  ""These adjusted measures reflect how management evaluates the underlying performance of the business and provide a basis for comparison with similar companies in our industry."",
  ""On fiscal year 2025, we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share between $2 and $2.20."",
  ""From a modeling perspective, you should expect a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 24%, interest expense between $355 million and $365 million, depreciation and amortization expense between $510 million and $520 million, and approximately 244 million diluted weighted average shares outstanding."",
  ""We are also affirming our free cash flow guidance which is projected to be between $475 million and $525 million, supported by our capital-light business model and enhanced by targeted operational efficiencies."",
  ""The cash flow guidance contemplates cash interest between $325 million and $340 million, tax payments between $145 million and $165 million, and capital expenditures between $40 million and $50 million."",
  ""I will note that we expect quarterly sequential increases in all metrics through fiscal year 2025, primarily as a result of newly awarded programs ramping up, as well as from a 53rd week in the fourth quarter."",
  ""Further, we expect cash flow will follow normal seasonality with the majority generated in the second half of the fiscal year, as a result of fringe benefit and payroll timing and as a result of expected strong collections in the fourth quarter given our alignment with the government fiscal year-end."",
  ""Finally on slide 10, I would like to introduce the two reportable segments, Digital Solutions and Global Engineering Solutions, that we are excited to begin reporting on in fiscal year 2025."",
  ""For more information, including a recast of historical performance, please refer to the supplementary financial information, which will be available on our Investor Relations website."",
  ""Closing on slide 11, we are pleased with our fiscal year 2024 performance, which reflects the strength of our business and track record of execution."",
  ""As we look forward to fiscal year 2025 and beyond, we are well positioned to meet our financial objectives and remain confident in our ability to deliver strong free cash flow growth and long-term value for stakeholders."",
  ""With that, operator, please open the line for questions.""
]","[
  ""I was hoping you could elaborate on your comments on DOGE, which I did appreciate, in the prepared remarks."",
  ""And maybe draw a spectrum of the areas that you think are least likely to come under budget pressure, where other ones that may come under budget pressure and understanding that your specific activities, hard to discern what will happen there."",
  ""And then, maybe could you comment on what you're hearing from your legislative affairs people for how long a CR is likely to last into next year?"",
  ""If I could just get a couple more in."",
  ""I'm wondering, I know you're fresh off of the merger."",
  ""Hasn't been that many months."",
  ""What have you learned since the combined company that maybe you didn't fully know at the Capital Markets Day?"",
  ""And I'm curious, from a leverage perspective, I see you're affirming your guidance to de-lever over the next couple of years."",
  ""Is there any opportunity to do it a little bit more quickly?"",
  ""But I don't know, any portfolio shaping or anything that you could do on a proactive basis?"",
  ""I'll get back in the queue."",
  "" for taking my questions and congrats on a solid public market debut."",
  ""Maybe just at a high level, there were some really good announcements during the quarter around environmental/kind of nuclear-focused deals."",
  ""And just curious kind of how you guys are viewing that opportunity with kind of – with respect to AI more specifically and if nuclear becomes more of a priority for whether it's here domestically or internationally, if you feel like you're well positioned kind of in the current set of capabilities to help kind of, I guess, reinvigorate that area or if there might be some more training or people to bring on board in order to kind of better attack that opportunity and kind of just what you feel kind of that longer-term sort of picture of what that might look like over time from an opportunity perspective?"",
  "" both for the color."",
  ""Maybe just a quick follow-up for Travis, if I can."",
  ""The guidance assumptions that you laid out in the presentation called for 8% new business as part of that kind of top line estimate."",
  ""Just further comments around the incoming administration, I understand it's early days, etcetera, but how much of that 8% of new business kind of – is there either wiggle room or kind of optionality, I think you said $35 billion in contracts being submitted."",
  ""I'm not sure if that was just for this coming fiscal year, if that's – has a longer term on it."",
  ""But I guess how, of that 8% where I'm assuming there's multiple avenues to kind of get there, but how much does that maybe flux or change based on kind of what changes the kind of the incoming administration may or may not do?"",
  ""I'll get back in the queue."",
  "" for taking my questions here."",
  ""I just want to get maybe start with a housekeeping item."",
  ""Hanford is not in book-to-bill."",
  ""And if it's not, how would you mechanically add that into backlog with it being such a big contract?"",
  ""Maybe just sticking on the kind of the bookings thread, you have $23 billion that you talked about that's waiting adjudication."",
  ""Can you maybe break down and put a little bit finer point on new versus recompete, and then talk about some of the bigger recompetes and the timing within that pipeline?"",
  ""And then maybe, John, just one for you."",
  ""I'm pretty excited about the opportunities in your new intel footprint."",
  ""Seems like the business has scale in some new contract vehicles."",
  ""Can you maybe give us some thoughts on how you can kind of reaccelerate your intel footprint across the new enterprise?"",
  ""Looking forward to seeing that matriculate."",
  "" so much for taking my questions."",
  ""Just wanted to solicit any kind of commentary you would have from a modeling perspective as far as seasonality or factors to consider, things that have changed."",
  ""We know that you are affirming your annual guidance, but there may be inputs that have changed."",
  ""Certainly, the rate outlook seems to be different than it was in August."",
  ""And then, maybe wondering if you could give us the quarterly book-to-bill for the fourth quarter."",
  ""In the fourth quarter book-to-bill, I think we saw the fiscal commentary but I was curious how that that final quarter shaped up."",
  ""And the last thing from me is, I was wondering if you could comment about if – can you sort of break out in the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as the multiple fronts that have been active in the Middle East calm down, what kind of direct or indirect exposure do you think that you have relative to sort of the high up-tempo that even domestic customers may have in helping support those allies?"",
  ""Obviously, DOGE is a big topic for the entire industry, as we wait to hear what the details are."",
  ""And I think that's – probably the first thing I would say is it's really too early to make a call as to where DOGE is going to focus or what the potential impact will be."",
  ""I would say, from our perspective, we have 80% of our focus on the US government, 20% between international governments and commercial, and then even our 80% of the US government, primarily national security focused, we feel very strongly that the work we do for the US government is very much focused on critical missions."",
  ""We've seen that like in sequestration, other shutdowns where vast majority of our work just is deemed a priority and keeps going."",
  ""With that said, we know that DOGE is a real element within the incoming administration."",
  ""We are very much awaiting to hear more details."",
  ""I think when you look at the portfolio mix of our business, a very small percentage of our overall portfolio focused on civilian agencies."",
  ""So, we do think that we have limited exposure to what might be the priority focus of DOGE, even what we do for the civilian agencies very national security focused, homeland security, rocket technology, things that are a priority."",
  ""And even – additionally, if you look at NASA and that area of the business, we do believe that the US is in a kind of a space race with the Chinese, very much a priority in terms of national security just keeping up with the Chinese."",
  ""So, I think overall, we're pretty confident that Amentum is in a very strong position."",
  ""With respect to the continued resolution, our understanding is that the administration is working on a plan to kind of kick that ball further into the future far beyond the administration's transition to something between February and April will be our expectations of where the CR will take us."",
  ""A very strong area for Amentum, as I think everyone knows, and bringing these two companies together only strengthened our ability to deliver in this environmental and energy market in the US, very strong presence."",
  ""But now, even in Europe, Asia presence around the world as a leader in environmental remediation and energy – in the energy sector and great success as well."",
  ""Our track record of winning is very strong."",
  ""We're a leader in the US, a very significant partner to the UK government in this area, and governments across Europe and now even in Japan."",
  ""But of course, the biggest significant event for us was the Hanford contract win of – we've been doing that work for some time, great partnership."",
  ""And we're able to kind of bring that after a few protest to conclusion and have that in our business for the next 10 years is really exciting $45 billion contract."",
  ""So, large strong track record."",
  ""We do see continued growth."",
  ""We see that in the energy area, in particular across Europe where we're partnered with companies, OEMs that are developing small modular reactors."",
  ""And there's really a push to get out of the development of fossil fuels as a source of electricity and expand and invest in those areas."",
  ""And our engineering capability is well known and opening up opportunities in the energy sector."",
  ""But we also see opportunities with NNSA here in the US where we have a great footprint with the Department of Energy and there's a whole host of opportunities on the NNSA side that we see as growth going forward."",
  ""And then, using technology, as you mentioned, we think is key and an opportunity with the broader footprint of Amentum to leverage that."",
  ""I don't know, Steve, maybe you want to talk about some of the things we're doing in the technology area to help spur growth."",
  ""And $2 billion of recompete awards under protest, we typically see protest on large bids, and that's just part of the industry."",
  ""But typically, when they're recompetes and you win them, we see less of a probability."",
  ""But that's, in some respect, not surprising."",
  ""But we feel pretty good about those – that $2 billion of recompetes that we were awarded, and that are under protest and should be re-awarded shortly."",
  ""This is a very significant focus for us and I talked about at Capital Markets Day where – when you step back and look at Amentum coming together, very broad, we're in five core markets that we have talked about, and we do believe the intelligence market probably represents one of the larger growth opportunities of bringing these two companies together, partly because when you looked at the two businesses individually, neither of us were at scale."",
  ""We each were just under $1 billion of footprint in the intelligence community."",
  ""Doing missions of significance, but just not at scale, the Jacobs C&I business very strong in cybersecurity, really well known in the community, both in kind of the regular three-letter agencies, civilian side, but also defense side and homeland security, and then the Amentum side, very mission focused, data analytics and mission support."",
  ""You bring the two together, more of an end-to-end capability, more customer reach, now a business that scale closer to about $1.7 billion."",
  ""And our opportunity, we think, is on those enterprise mission support contracts, information technology-focused enterprise contracts that we really weren't putting in our pipeline before."",
  ""We didn't have the confidence."",
  ""We didn't have the kind of backlog of experience doing those large enterprise contracts with the technology expertise that we needed."",
  ""Now, combined, we are looking to expand our backlog of pipeline opportunities in those areas."",
  ""And when you think of the breadth of the community, the NRO, as an example, was a customer, but something we weren't really focused on the big enterprise contracts."",
  ""The NSA, the same, was a customer but not really on those large enterprise contracts."",
  ""DIA is a customer that we think with the SIA 3 contract as a prime that now opens up the door to do more together as a prime bidder, not a contract vehicle that we were focused as a prime before."",
  ""So, we think there are lots of opportunity to expand our pipeline, and then you will see that in the coming quarters our focus there."",
  ""Yeah, and I would just add that – I mean, we're very much focused on leveraging this combined business to expand our addressable market and see bidding improve."",
  ""And have a more consistent book-to-bill."",
  ""But I mean, I could say we are really kind of had a line of sight on bidding $35 billion this year."",
  ""When you look at last year, we did win $12 billion, and we had over $30 billion of submits."",
  ""So, we're expecting that number to grow, now that was on a pro forma basis, but not leveraging the combined entity."",
  ""Now, I think we've set a target of bidding $35 billion."",
  ""And you can think, once we really get our arms around what we brought together, we think that number can grow."",
  ""So, thinking about years into the future, seeing $35 billion go up."",
  ""So, we really take the opportunity, the power of these two companies together, the opportunity to reach into other addressable markets is going to give us the ability to bid more and win more."",
  ""And then, just thinking of the second part of the question on kind of outside exposure."",
  ""Yeah, we have a diverse kind of business, which is our benefit where international customers Well, , Shelby."",
  ""And  all for your interest in Amentum."",
  ""We wish everyone a safe and healthy holiday season and look forward to continuing to update you on our progress over the coming quarters."",
  ""Really a key topic, appreciate you raising it."",
  ""I think first – Steve Arnette here, Tobey."",
  ""First, I would say that we knew coming into the merger we could see kind of academically, if you will, that the combined company would have a significantly strengthened position in the market, both from a expanded set, a broader scope, if you will, of customer offerings, but also from the fact that both incoming businesses would gain access to a lot of new customers."",
  ""So, we were excited about the potential there."",
  ""I would say, internally, as we've now come together and had a two-plus months of working together, we're really energized by what we've seen."",
  ""We see across the breadth of the combined company the opportunity to really accelerate and continue advancing our digital capabilities, which position us well for larger contracts in key growth markets."",
  ""We have – and bringing that to light, being able to identify and really connect experts from across the business in emerging technology areas, we formalized nine centers of excellence, we've already stood up a host of technical advisory groups in key technology areas, and we put that into motion."",
  ""And so, what we've really mobilized right away is a set of experts that bring knowledge of a multitude of use cases in some of these advanced technology areas, it's almost become like an internal crowdsourcing, if you will, and being able to bring the best solutions to all of our customer opportunities."",
  ""We think it creates And just quickly, by way of specific opportunities, if you think about the white space from both businesses, there's kind of as we come together big opportunities in terms of kind of clean energy transition, a lot around nuclear and SMRs that were addressed in the prepared remarks but global opportunities for intelligence analytics and specialized operations, a lot in the way of national security space that we are now together well positioned to go win and execute, as well as a lot of international opportunity around AUKUS and other programs."",
  ""So, we have kind of brought that to life in a way that's been, I would say, better than we could even have known before we were joined together as one company."",
  ""And Travis, maybe you want to comment on the leveraging question?"",
  ""In regards to leverage, we're definitely excited about, first and foremost, where we ended fiscal year 2024, which was slightly better than expected, really driven by EBITDA that was slightly higher than expectations, as well as better-than-expected cash performance."",
  ""And so, as we look forward, and you're right, we're committed to that 3 times net leverage target by the end of FY 2026."",
  ""There are a couple of areas that we see that we aren't counting on that could accelerate our ability to de-lever, maybe just to name a couple."",
  ""First is, as we look at working capital, we've kind of assumed a stable working capital environment."",
  ""But even as we come together, we see opportunities to take best practices from both legacy organizations, perhaps perform a little bit better on DSO and days working capital efficiency."",
  ""And then obviously, we provided a range of outcomes in our guidance related to EBITDA."",
  ""And if we're able to perform at the higher end of that range, obviously that will help accelerate deleveraging."",
  ""And as part of that, the cost synergy commitments that we've made, we're making good progress there."",
  ""We see great line of sight into kind of how we've thought about that Really appreciate that, John."",
  ""And I think that these emerging tech areas, and I addressed it earlier, are one of the most compelling findings that we've unearthed as we come together and began collaborating as the new Amentum."",
  ""You mentioned AI, and it's really been a little bit pretty powerful actually to see all of the different use cases."",
  ""And the striking characteristic is maybe you think of AI as being something that's mobilized in the intel sector."",
  ""It really cuts across sectors, where our teams are deploying AI across intel, defense, several different commercial applications, even getting into some of the energy areas."",
  ""And if you look at it, and we've kind of built out and connected that network of experts, the kinds of things we're doing with AI, certainly data collection and processing, being able to take in rapid fashion, multiple streams of data, enhanced data analysis, even getting into predictive analytics."",
  ""But a couple things that to get to the next level is that we have been successful in being able to use the technology for real-time threat detection, really making a positive impact on some of the missions we support, as well as being able to start integrating this technology with existing security systems that we know our teams highlight how."",
  ""As you get into AI, you have to be very cybersecurity aware because you're, potentially if you don't do it right, exposing data to potential attack."",
  ""So, there's a premium on cybersecurity, and our teams have developed great processes for isolated implementations for critical missions of national importance."",
  ""So, we're very excited about the momentum around AI across the business."",
  ""The first thing that I highlight, as we put together our position to affirm the guidance we originally provided at Capital Markets Day, it's obviously the guidance reflects many different assumptions and scenarios in terms of how things could actually play out, which is obviously why we provide a range."",
  ""And we feel confident in that range with everything that we know today."",
  ""In terms of the composition of where we think the revenue can come from, yeah, you're right, as we sit here today, over 92%, we believe, will come from existing work or from recompete awards."",
  ""And then, what I would say about the new business that we have in our outlook, it's not concentrated in any one particular large opportunity that we need to win to be inside that guidance range."",
  ""It really is a well-diversified set of opportunities, and it's aligned with what John talked about earlier, really matters of critical importance for our nation, as well as our commercial and international customers."",
  ""So, we feel really good about where things stand at this point in the fiscal year, and look forward to keeping you updated as the year progresses."",
  ""So, glad you asked the question."",
  ""It is a unique dynamic as you look at Amentum's backlog by and large."",
  ""As you know, in our environmental market, those customers do tend to procure a little bit differently than perhaps some of the other customers in our business through really joint venture partnerships to bring the strengths of both Amentum and our partners to bear on those opportunities."",
  ""So – and sometimes they're consolidated joint venture opportunities where we do recognize revenue and they are reflected in backlog, and then other times they're unconsolidated joint venture opportunities that, to your point, are not reflected in backlog."",
  ""So, they represent really good opportunity for long-term solid cash flow that provides that stability, that's really a fundamental thing in our business."",
  ""So, Hanford, you're right, is not included in that, but we have contemplated obviously the earnings contributions both in our FY 2025 and longer-term outlook."",
  ""So, as of year-end, we had $23 billion of submitted bids award awaiting decision, approximately 80% of those pending awards were new business."",
  ""And then, I'll also just take this opportunity to reemphasize that we also had $2 billion worth of recompete awards."",
  ""They were outstanding at year-end."",
  ""Obviously, recompetes are a thing that naturally happen in our industry, but the $2 billion is a little bit higher."",
  ""In fact, actually, it's almost nearly double what it was a year ago."",
  ""So, something that we don't typically expect to see on recompete awards."",
  ""And in terms of kind of looking forward and where the recompete opportunities are, there's no large kind of recompete award in that pending decision."",
  ""As we've talked about, as we look at our top 10 contracts specifically, only one of those is up for recompete in fiscal year 2025."",
  ""And in fact, it probably will get extended beyond then."",
  ""So, we feel really good about the revenue composition and where it's going to come from within our guidance range for 2025."",
  ""Yeah, in terms of seasonality, Tobey, based on the timing of our fiscal year and typical holiday and vacation timings, and then obviously we have the dynamic of the ramp-up of our new programs, the first half always tends to be a little bit lighter than the second half in terms of revenue, profitability as well as cash."",
  ""Saying that 48% range in the first half of the fiscal year and 52% in the second half of the fiscal year."",
  ""And in FY 2025, that's also impacted by more business days that actually fall in the fourth quarter this fiscal year."",
  ""So, those are just a couple of things to keep in mind."",
  ""And then, in addition, we obviously have the ramp-down of SciTech that will be an impact through Q2 of fiscal year 2025."",
  ""And then, on the cash front, in addition to that, as you know, there's cyclicality sometimes and benefits timing as well as payroll."",
  ""And then, the fact that our fourth quarter aligns with the government fiscal year-end, that tends to be our strongest cash flow quarter with collections and DSO coming in better than the first three quarters of fiscal year."",
  ""On the first part of that follow-up, Tobey, Q4 book-to-bill was less than 1, and it was really impacted by the $2 billion worth of recompete awards that were under protest, as well as the significant volume of some pending award at $23 billion."",
  ""And then, I'll let John take the second part of that question.""

19,3130743,0Y3Y1Z-E,2024-11-26,"[
  ""Over the last few months, we have been focused on three main initiatives."",
  ""One, improving our top line sales comp growth trajectory; two, driving improved profitability at both the venue level and corporate level."",
  ""And three, opening high quality locations within our current funding capacity."",
  ""Let me speak to each of these areas, starting with improving our top line comp growth."",
  ""As most of you are aware, consumer wallets remain pressured and we are seeing this most pronounced in our open play business, which was down approximately 13% year over year in Q2, while our event business was only down approximately 6%."",
  ""For our open play business, we are focused on ensuring we have the right level of value for our guests through programs such as Happy Hour gaming promotion, where you can enjoy a lane and bowl for 50% off during certain hours, as well as our daily specials and weekend brunch offerings."",
  ""In addition, our local store marketing campaigns have seen exciting success as we have introduced activities such as kids clubs, comedy nights, line dancing, yoga classes, trivia nights and many other community activities that complement our F&B and gaming offering."",
  ""As we entered the fiscal third quarter, we continue to test programs that we believe are right for our brand and our guests while being quick to discontinue those that did not perform to expectation."",
  ""We believe we found the right balance as demonstrated by the substantial improvement in our comp performance in recent weeks compared to the second quarter."",
  ""On the events side of the business, our third quarter is seasonally strongest and our teams are working hard to drive as many events as possible for Pinstripes through the holiday season."",
  ""We are encouraged by the fact that we are seeing strong lead generation and booking performance on the events side of the business in recent weeks and our continued investment in the tourism and convention segment of our event business is showing very promising bookings and sales results."",
  ""With respect to profitability, our team has successfully removed the annualized $10 million in cost savings we spoke to last quarter."",
  ""This is most evident in our mature store base with margin leverage in cost of sales, labor and operating expenses despite our current short term comp growth headwinds."",
  ""These savings range from strategic, hourly and salaried labor savings and more favorable credit card processing agreement to more intense negotiations with our various vendor partners, leveraging our growing scale and brand."",
  ""The second quarter saw substantially all of these savings implemented and we expect the full run rate benefit going forward."",
  ""In addition, we are a target in removing approximately $4 million of additional annualized savings in our SG&A with the majority of these savings yet to fully flow through our financials."",
  ""These cost savings range from negotiations with agency partners to strategic corporate head count reductions, and a renewed focus on marketing efficiency."",
  ""Following the completion of our cost reduction efforts at the venue level and ongoing work on corporate level costs, we believe we are on track towards the appropriate cost structure to drive long-term top line performance through same store sales growth as well as new unit openings while ensuring we are maintaining sufficient corporate level profitability."",
  ""Turning to new unit development on November 15, we opened our 18th location in Walnut Creek, California at Broadway Plaza, marking our second location in the San Francisco area in close proximity to our location in San Mateo."",
  ""This new two-story Walnut Creek venue features 25,000 square feet across two levels, with eight bowling lanes, two indoor bocce courts and private event space for groups of up to 1,500."",
  ""Our opening to date has been very promising and our initial private event bookings have been very strong, complementing the continued success of our San Mateo location."",
  ""Finally, I want to touch on our liquidity."",
  ""As of October 13, we had $3.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, while we anticipate significant positive cash flow in the third fiscal quarter as holiday sales volumes increase substantially, we are also evaluating and seeking to raise additional external capital, which could include funding from new outside sources as well as additional funds from our existing lenders."",
  ""We will continue to balance our unit growth pipeline with the capital available to us as we scale our business nationwide."",
  ""In summary, despite challenging results for the second quarter, we are encouraged by what we are seeing in recent weeks as trends have improved substantially."",
  ""The holiday event period for Pinstripes is a significant source of EBITDA and we are optimistic about our potential in the fiscal third quarter."",
  ""We continue to believe that our high quality, connection oriented dining, entertainment and event spaces put us in a strong position to drive long-term shareholder value."",
  ""Of course, none of this would be possible without the passion and dedication of our more than 2,000 team members as they continue to provide our guests with those magical moments they've come to expect from Pinstripes."",
  ""With that, let me now turn the call over to our CFO, Tony, to discuss our fiscal second quarter results in greater detail."",
  ""The fiscal second quarter total revenue increased 7.5% to $26.5 million, compared to $24.6 million in the same quarter last year, including an 8.6% increase in food and beverage revenues and 3.6% increase in recreation revenues."",
  ""Increase in total revenue was primarily due to having four new stores opened in the second quarter of fiscal 2025 for the full period compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, partially offset by modest decreases in volume at our 13 legacy locations."",
  ""Cost of food and beverage as a percentage of total revenue increased 10 basis points to 17.5%, primarily due to cost efficiencies offsetting changes in product mix."",
  ""Labor and benefits as a percentage of total revenue increased 100 basis points to 38.9%, primarily due to the addition of four new stores contributing to higher store labor and benefit costs."",
  ""Excluding the addition of four new stores, store labor and benefit costs were down approximately 30 basis points."",
  ""Occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenue were 18.6%."",
  ""Other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased 100 basis points to 19.9%, primarily due to decreases in repairs and maintenance activities, credit card fees and technology offset by an increase in insurance costs and janitorial costs."",
  ""Venue-level EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue decreased 160 basis points to 5%, driven by modest negative store contribution from some of our new locations that opened in fiscal 2024 as these stores continue to progress through the maturation curve with the profitability of this group continuing to improve."",
  ""Please refer to our  for a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures."",
  ""Our mature stores, those opened more than 24 months, generated average contribution margins of 8.3%, representing a 50 basis point increase year over year, driven primarily by cost efficiency improvements that we've previously discussed."",
  ""General and administrative expenses increased to $5.1 million compared to $3.8 million in the same period last year."",
  ""Turning to liquidity as of October 13, 2024, we had $3.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $114 million of debt outstanding."",
  ""For the third fiscal quarter, we anticipate positive cash flow and continue to evaluate additional liquidity options, including but not limited to raising additional capital and receiving additional funding from our existing lenders."",
  ""With that, in lieu of annual guidance, we want to provide an update on our quarter to date results."",
  ""Third quarter to date through November 24, 2024, same store sales decreased 8.1% with the last two weeks up 10.1%."",
  ""We opened one new venue in Walnut Creek, California on November 15 and do not anticipate opening any additional venues during the quarter."",
  ""And we expect overall venue-level EBITDA to be meaningfully higher than prior year and adjusted EBITDA to be positive in Q3 and above prior year."",
  ""We'd like to  again for your interest in Pinstripes."",
  ""Dale and I are now happy to answer any questions that you may have."",
  ""Operator, please open the line for questions.""
]","[
  ""Just question on the same store sales, I understand the last couple of weeks have improved, but still quarter to date is pretty down meaningfully after down 9% in the second quarter."",
  ""So can you just outline what you believe the pressures are, maybe dig a little deeper into that."",
  ""How much is macro versus maybe what you can control?"",
  ""And just a follow up question is on margins."",
  ""I know we're talking about EBITDA for the third quarter."",
  ""And is there any outlook you can give us on restaurant level margins, just considering the previous disclosure on guidance."",
  ""How are you thinking about restaurant level margins in the second half?"",
  ""So, I understand you're looking for positive operating cash flow in the third quarter."",
  ""But looking beyond that, can you give us a sense of how far your current liquidity can take you before you need to raise more capital, before it becomes really something you have to do?"",
  ""And then on Coral Gables, it sounds like that's being pushed out into fiscal 2026 at this point."",
  ""Could you give us a better idea on the timing around that?"",
  ""And then I guess, on marketing, could you talk about maybe what misfired on marketing and maybe if you could describe what course correction measures you've implemented?"",
  ""Can you guys hear me all right?"",
  ""So just a question on the most recent comp trajectory that you see an improvement, could you just talk about, is that – I don't know if I missed it."",
  ""Is that from mostly from open play events, just any color around that?"",
  ""And then also... ...is this typical for your business to have this much volatility in same store sales or just trying to understand why so volatile in the most recent weeks?"",
  ""And can you guys provide a little bit of color on just the breakdown, maybe in the quarterly comp and maybe going forward in terms of how much pricing or check you expect in the go forward comps versus traffic?"",
  ""One of the main elements, we have a quite substantial paid digital spend, not just Google AdWord (sic) [Google AdWords], but Facebook and other."",
  ""And we've been in a reevaluation of that spend."",
  ""We decreased it a bit in, call it, the early period of Q2 to get a beta testing to see what the flow-through and effects are."",
  ""And we did see some diminution in sales by pulling back the spend and we very quickly course adjusted and so that's what you're hearing Tony mostly referred to."",
  ""I want to just thank everyone again for joining us this afternoon and your interest in Pinstripes."",
  ""We wish everyone a Happy giving and holidays and hope to see you all in any of our 18 locations across the country and experience the magic with us."",
  ""I'd say if I wanted to unpack kind of the Q2 comp, I'd say half of it is macro."",
  ""And I'm using the events business as kind of our proxy there."",
  ""And then relative to that open play business, we control our destiny a little bit more on the events side."",
  ""And so you can see the macro pressure kind of making up half that 9%."",
  ""And then the rest, I'd say is, look, we did some aggressive promotional activity, particularly on the gaming side of the business."",
  ""And we changed some things from a marketing perspective, which we've since course corrected."",
  ""And we're seeing the results in the last couple of weeks, which is why we called it out specifically in our prepared remarks."",
  ""I mean, so obviously, if you look at just Q2, in spite of some pretty negative sales leverage, we still increased margins."",
  ""So, we don't expect that much negative sales leverage to be in the second half that meaningfully better, I think just based on what we're seeing in the last couple of weeks, look but still, given the volatility, we're not going to call out a specific number on venue-level margins, but it's very obvious you can just look at just the last quarter and say, look, if the sales are meaningfully better, which we're thinking they are, you're going to see that flow through a pretty high rate."",
  ""So that's what we're saying."",
  ""We – hey, Matt, it's Tony."",
  ""So, we believe our current liquidity situation, given the build in cash that we'll see here as we work through the holiday season plus the cost out that we've completed, we should be able to get through most of calendar 2025 with our current liquidity situation and debt service."",
  ""We have to – look, we're looking at it raising additional capital."",
  ""So we're not being shy about that."",
  ""But we do have with the holiday season and what we're seeing kind of on the outlook enough liquidity to get well into next year."",
  ""We didn't say it's pushed out into fiscal 2026, just not in Q3."",
  ""So likely in Q4 of fiscal 2025, Coral Gables will open."",
  ""So look a little color on the quarter to date comp, primarily driven by the events business and there is a little bit of volatility in that."",
  ""So it can be or I should say more lumpy, which drives some of that."",
  ""In terms of is our business normally that's volatile, I'd say, look, this is a macro environment that we haven't seen in some time."",
  ""And so, that's probably amplifying a bit what is otherwise us lapping some pretty big comps over the last couple years."",
  ""So in Q2, we had an effective 2% what I'll call menu price increase on the business that was completely offset by promotional pricing and gaming."",
  ""So the 9.4% is essentially traffic."",
  ""And then how the comp broke down in the quarter, that mid-July to mid-August period, we were down about 8%, and then we saw significant change kind of in mid-August to mid-September and then back to about 8% down in mid-September to the end of the quarter and middle of October."",
  ""So really it was that kind of the middle four weeks that really drove us down further than I would have expected.""

  ""I'm joined this morning by James Mortensen, our CFO; and also Tony Wood, our new Chairman."",
  ""For this morning's presentation, I'll cover some group highlights for the year and some comments on the company's strong long-term prospects."",
  ""I'll then hand over to James, who'll take us through the financial and operational performance in more detail."",
  ""And then I'll comment on the general market environment and the progress we have made in delivering an organic growth strategy."",
  ""In 2024, the group marked its 50th anniversary as a listed company on the London Stock Exchange with another year of positive performance."",
  ""The emphasis we continue to place on building a resilient business has enabled us to overcome the occasional operational headwind and positions us well to take advantage of the significant organic growth opportunities we have available to us."",
  ""During the year, we increased our organic growth investment program, and this has been matched by the strong order intake we expected."",
  ""Across the year, we have delivered good progress and growing momentum against our stated goal of balancing near-term performance with longer-term growth and value creation."",
  ""Clearly, none of this would be possible without the commitment and dedication of our people, and I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank all of my colleagues across the whole of the group for their unrelenting professionalism and hard work."",
  ""Turning now to the headline numbers and the heightened activity in both sectors."",
  ""Our three Energetics businesses had an outstanding year, with all three delivering record order books and two of them – two of the three delivering record revenues and operating profits."",
  ""Roke maintained its track record of delivering growing revenues and operating profit, and that our UK Countermeasures business finished the year with a full slate of record order intake, order book, record revenue and record operating profit, which is quite an achievement for the team in Salisbury."",
  ""Overall, group revenues grew 8% to £510 million."",
  ""Earning per share was £0.193, and cash conversion grew from 90% to 102%, continuing to demonstrate the cash generative nature of our group."",
  ""I think the standout result is the £673 million of order intake our businesses have won during the year, which results in the group reporting a record order book of £1.04 billion, which is up 13% since the end of last year."",
  ""Further evidence, if any of you need it, of the strength of our end markets."",
  ""We've also continued to make good progress delivering our safety and ESG plans and their associated key metrics continue to improve."",
  ""I'll now hand over to James who'll take you through the financial, operational and innovation review."",
  ""Let me briefly remind you of our strategic imperatives."",
  ""Our approach remains evolution, not revolution."",
  ""And our values of safety, excellence and innovation are foundational to all of our plans, as does our relentless focus on balancing near-term performance with longer-term growth and value creation."",
  ""And beyond that, our strategy is based around three imperatives."",
  ""Our primary focus is to grow the company by investing in our businesses and the development of our people, our intellectual property and our infrastructure."",
  ""Next, we will seek to accelerate further growth with bolt-on acquisitions, most likely in the area – in the Roke areas of defense electronics, information advantage and active cyber defense, and also in the design and manufacture of mission-critical components and devices used in space and missile applications."",
  ""And our third imperative is the continued investment in our sole source market leading businesses with a focus on improving safety, modernization, automation, and new product development."",
  ""Turning now to the market environment."",
  ""Whether it's the ongoing conflicts in the Ukraine or the Middle East or the increasing threats in the Asia Pacific, geopolitical tensions are continue to drive a fundamental rearmament upcycle, which is expected to last at least another decade."",
  ""In the US, the incoming administration are signaling a focus on deterrence against emerging threats and we expect US defense spending to at least grow in line with inflation."",
  ""Here in the UK, the new government has reaffirmed the commitment to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP, and they have launched a strategic defense review and a defense industrial strategy."",
  ""We expect both will present further opportunities for all of our UK businesses."",
  ""But we are also maintaining a close watch on the risks of delay in the government procurement process while the SDR is running."",
  ""More broadly, NATO members are increasing spending on defense and the capacity and capability of their sovereign defense industrial bases."",
  ""All NATO countries are seeking to achieve a minimum of 2% GDP spent on defense, and 23 out of the 32 members are now meeting this threshold."",
  ""In supporting our customers to win in the ever-changing threat environment, we see three drivers which present opportunities for the group to support our customers."",
  ""Firstly, the security threats in the Asia Pacific will continue to require investment in standoff and area-denial missile systems and space based systems, both of which are areas where we are very incumbent."",
  ""Second, the threat to Europe has resulted in many nations seeking to restore and enhance their defense and national security capabilities."",
  ""This is a combination of new technology-driven solutions such as electronic warfare and information advantage, and traditional defense capabilities, such as artillery rounds and shoulder- launched missiles."",
  ""The third is a threat to the UK's national security, driven in part by the other two threats."",
  ""The UK also faces threats of terrorism and organized crime, which continue to require Roke's capabilities in active cyber defense and operational mission support."",
  ""And we see an increasing use of artificial intelligence and other niche digital technologies."",
  ""I want to draw a specific focus on what is happening in the area of munitions and missiles, where the capacity – sorry, where the criticality of production and stockpiles has received significant attention from multiple commentators."",
  ""We all know in the 35 years since the collapse of the Berlin Wall in 1989, successive governments across NATO have allowed their military stockpiles to reduce."",
  ""And we all now know that Ukraine has proved these planning assumptions to be wrong."",
  ""We are told stockpiles are now at low levels and it is becoming clear that governments are increasingly concerned about the lack of scale of the west defense industrial base."",
  ""We believe the increased demand for our products is very long term, which has underpinned our decision to invest to appropriately increase the capacity of our three Energetics businesses."",
  ""So, how are those expansion plans progressing?"",
  ""The expansion of our Norwegian business is our largest growth opportunity as we expand production to satisfy the unprecedented demand for high-grade military energetic material for use primarily in missile ammunition systems."",
  ""The business is currently operating at maximum capacity, and in parallel, we are executing on-site expansion programs which will increase capacity up to 275%."",
  ""A major milestone has been completion of the new asset recovery facility, which is the green building on the slide, which is now in the process of being commissioned."",
  ""So progress is very real and very tangible."",
  ""Such is the level of demand for Chemring Nobel's materials, we are now looking at further expansion plans beyond that which we are delivering on site."",
  ""In October, in conjunction with the Norwegian government, we launched a feasibility study into the establishment of a new large-scale production facility in Norway."",
  ""This co-funded study will assess geographic locations, infrastructure requirements and environmental considerations, and it will also assess funding and commercial arrangements with the Norwegian government."",
  ""We are also exploring options outside of Norway."",
  ""Last month we signed a 12-year framework agreement with Diehl Defence and received a €231 million initial purchase order for MCX energetic material."",
  ""As part of this agreement, we're also exploring options to perform the blending stage of the manufacturing process in Germany."",
  ""Turning now to the US, where we continue to see growing demand for precision-engineered devices for space and missile applications, and where our business in Chicago is a highly respected supplier to US government agencies, defense prime contractors, and now a growing number of commercial space launch providers."",
  ""In January, the business acquired an additional 45,000 square foot facility adjacent to its existing site, and the new facility doubled existing production floor space and commenced operations in April and has been – and has significantly enhanced our ability to establish and maintain continuous flow manufacturing operations, which was essential if we were to deliver against customer requirements and is also a key enabler for future growth."",
  ""And in Scotland, where we are building the most advanced extruded double base propellants manufacturing facility in Europe and significantly increasing capacity in a safe and modern manufacturing environment, the progress has – the progress that has been made on site throughout the year has been impressive with the photos on this slide giving you an idea of the transformation that is taking place."",
  ""The project is on schedule and within budget, with buildings nearing completion and equipment starting to be installed."",
  ""With the facilities being handed over in early 2025, we'll then commence with the commissioning and qualification program, which, given the nature of the product being manufactured, is a comprehensive activity and we expect live production to begin no later than early 2027."",
  ""Turning now to Roke, where FY 2024 has been another record year in terms of revenue, profit and cash generation."",
  ""Roke's strategy is working, and by focusing predominantly on the tip of the spear, it has continued to cement its position as a key strategic supplier to the UK government's UK national security agencies."",
  ""And despite government spending headwinds, multiple orders valued at circa £50 million were received from the national security community."",
  ""In line with our focus on increasing revenue from the defense and product side of Roke, we've continued to see growing customer interest in our range of defense capabilities."",
  ""A notable highlight during the period were further wins in electronic warfare, with contracts received from customers in Sweden, Lithuania, Latvia, the United Arab Emirates and Japan."",
  ""The order for 10 Resolve EW systems to Japan was particularly noticeable."",
  ""This was Roke's first EW sale into the East Asia region and secures a high quality reference customer."",
  ""So Roke now has a five-year prospective sales pipeline that is valued at greater than £300 million for defense products as customers increase their focus on these technologies."",
  ""Earlier I mentioned the strategic defense review."",
  ""From Roke's perspective, our assessment is that our strengths are well aligned to supporting the UK government with the key challenges they identified in the terms of reference for the SDR."",
  ""We therefore anticipate that the SDR should increase opportunities for Roke."",
  ""But as James commented earlier, there may be some headwinds, including departmental budget pressures until the SDR is published next year."",
  ""Whilst we are mindful of these potential near-term headwinds, it does not impact all our plans to grow Roke's annual revenues to £250 million by 2028."",
  ""And that plan remains on track."",
  ""So to conclude, we have made good progress in 2024 as we continue to build and grow our high quality and resilient business and as we invest for future growth."",
  ""We have 77% of our expected 2025 revenue in the order book at the end of October, and the board's expectations for 2025 performance remains in line with the market expectations, but with a slight weighting to the second half."",
  ""So with market leading, innovative products, technologies and services that are critical to our customers and with a strong balance sheet, I'm very confident that we will meet our ambition of £1 billion in annual revenue by 2030 and that we will continue to deliver on our commitment to balance near-term performance with longer-term growth and value creation."",
  ""So if anyone has any questions, we'll be happy to take them now."",
  ""Can I please ask that you state your name and the organization that you represent... [Abrupt End], Mick."",
  ""We're pleased to report results in line with expectations and that record order book gives us great momentum as we build for the future."",
  ""And that record order book is now at £1 billion, up 13%."",
  ""And if the recently announced orders were included, it would have stood at £1.3 billion, up 43%."",
  ""Good momentum continued in revenue, up 8%."",
  ""Operating profit was up 3%, despite being held back by US countermeasures."",
  ""EPS, down 4%, impacted by higher tax and finance costs."",
  ""Strong cash conversion at 102%."",
  ""And so the board has declared a final dividend of £0.052, giving a total dividend of £0.078, up 13%."",
  ""So turning next to our segmental performance, Countermeasures & Energetics revenue grew 4%."",
  ""Growth in Energetics was offset by a weaker period for Countermeasures, so operating profit was down 8% and margin decreased to 15.6%."",
  ""Strong momentum continued in Sensors & Information with revenue up 13% and operating profit up 21%."",
  ""Operating profit margin was up slightly on last year at 19.5%, despite the continued investment to position Roke well for future growth."",
  ""Group revenue was up 8%, despite an FX headwind of £7 million."",
  ""Group operating profit was up 3%, but operating margin was down 70 basis points to 13.9%."",
  ""So let's look in a bit more detail at each of the segments."",
  ""It was another strong year for order intake in Countermeasures & Energetics, demonstrating the critical, highly engineered nature of the products in this segment."",
  ""As our customers' programs are ramping, we are seeing that demand often in the form of multiyear orders."",
  ""This was demonstrated by our recent $106 million five-year order supplying missile components."",
  ""Revenue grew 4% to £298 million, with strong operational performance across our Energetics and UK Countermeasures businesses."",
  ""Given the strong order coverage, this was a year focused on safely delivering against our operational plans."",
  ""Each of our sites worked tirelessly to meet our customers' expectations."",
  ""We had record years at a number of our sites."",
  ""We spoke about the operational challenges at our Tennessee facility in H1, and whilst progress hasn't been as fast as we hoped, we did make good progress in H2, continuing to ramp production and drive quality and efficiency as we go up that curve."",
  ""Overall margin was down 210 basis points to 15.6% as a result of those operational challenges in US Countermeasures and the legacy contracts we delivered against in H2 on which we made no profit."",
  ""The US customer has informed us that they have funding to extend that contract into FY 2025, and so that brings that lower margin contract into H1 and also pushes out two months of production of more profitable contracts into 2026."",
  ""Order cover remains really strong, with 97% coverage this year, 81% coverage next year, and 52% coverage in 2027."",
  ""So moving now to Sensors & Information where Roke posted another year of strong revenue growth."",
  ""It was up 23% excluding pass-through."",
  ""We were particularly pleased with the growing contribution made by our product and defense businesses, up 41% and 57%, respectively."",
  ""This was both from delivering electronic warfare products to countries from Lithuania to Japan, and also delivering against major programs such as the UK Army's new ISTAR modernization program known as Project ZODIAC."",
  ""Our national security business continued to perform strongly."",
  ""But we did slow recruitment in some areas in the second half in anticipation of a slowdown in spend given the UK election."",
  ""We now see that business as well positioned to take advantage when order flow improves."",
  ""Operating margin improved 120 basis points to 19.5%, driven by increased product and services revenue at Roke and a decline in lower margin diluted pass-through revenue, excluding which margin would have been up 40 basis points to 22.5%."",
  ""Order intake was down 30%, driven by a decrease in Roke as customers returned to placing annual orders and the order for JBTDS low rate initial production was in the prior year comparative."",
  ""But we are aware of the challenges some of our competitors are facing."",
  ""But our strategy to focus on our customers' most complex and challenging problems has meant to-date, we have been better shielded from budget challenges."",
  ""Our 48% order cover for FY 2025 is a few percentage points lower than we'd like at this time of year."",
  ""But given the critical areas where we support our customers, we expect order flow to improve as we go through the year."",
  ""Moving on to net debt."",
  ""With a strong focus on cash generation, operating cash was £96 million and cash conversion 102% in the year."",
  ""We have continued to invest in additional capacity with £49 million spent on the Energetics expansion project and a further £22 million spent on maintenance and automation."",
  ""This has been offset by £22 million of grant funding."",
  ""We've also returned £48 million to shareholders through our growing dividend and the share buyback, and we also purchased shares to satisfy acquisition consideration and employee share options."",
  ""We had closing net debt of £53 million, representing 0.56 times leverage."",
  ""We forecast net debt to rise to about 1 time next year with about £70 million to spend on Energetics expansion."",
  ""So now let me tell you a bit more about the grant funding, which really demonstrates our key position in the supply chain."",
  ""On the 18th of March, we announced £90 million of grant funding for Chemring Nobel to increase production of military explosives."",
  ""About £60 million was from the EU and the And I should flag, there are no commercial restrictions associated with grants."",
  ""We just have to deliver the increased capacity."",
  ""I'm also pleased to announce that we have entered into a UK export finance development guarantee facility for up to £80 million."",
  ""This is a full year arm's length facility on similar commercial terms to our RCF."",
  ""It brings our total available facilities and overdrafts to £246 million, giving us significant flexibility when we think about investments in further organic growth."",
  ""So next, a recap on capital allocation."",
  ""Overall, we want to maintain a resilient balance sheet and will target leverage of less than 1.5 times."",
  ""First, we'll continue to invest in the business."",
  ""Chemring Nobel remains primary focused for further investment."",
  ""We recently announced a feasibility study in Norway and similar conversations that are ongoing with a number of governments."",
  ""But we are also looking at opportunities to add capacity and increase automation in some of our other businesses, like the UK Countermeasures business and Roke."",
  ""Second, we'll continue to execute focused M&A within our core and close adjacencies, in particular Roke and US Space & Missiles."",
  ""We'll remain disciplined and we have a healthy pipeline of opportunity."",
  ""Third, dividends are a key part of shareholder returns."",
  ""The target of annual dividend cover of 2.5 times has now been met, and so we expect to And finally we'll return surplus capital to shareholders."",
  ""The buyback program has returned £37 million to shareholders and the board has determined that the relatively small amount remaining is better utilized in ongoing operations."",
  ""So the current buyback program will therefore lapse today."",
  ""Now let's turn to FY 2025 and how we see that progressing."",
  ""In Countermeasure & Energetics, we are targeting low-double digit growth that is made up of low-double digit growth in Energetics and mid-single digit growth in Countermeasures."",
  ""Sensors & Information will be flat."",
  ""US Sensors will decline those JBTDS is now completed low rate initial production and we await the start of full rate production, expected in FY 2026."",
  ""This will offset continued growth in Roke, and because we expect sensors and – and because of this, we expect Sensors & Information to decline slightly in the first half."",
  ""We are targeting mid-teens margin in the medium term, but unlikely to hit that in 2025."",
  ""And we expect the H1, H2 phasing to be similar to 2024 with about a 40-60 split in operating profit."",
  ""The impact of the UK government's recently announced increases to national insurance will be £1.7 million in 2025, rising to £2.6 million once the impact annualizes."",
  ""We'll work hard to absorb as much of that as possible, but a proportion will drop through to our bottom line."",
  ""We'll provide more detail on that at the half year."",
  ""There are also some external factors which could impact us in the near term."",
  ""We have administration change in the US and a strategic defense review in the UK."",
  ""Both could lead to short-term timing disruption and obviously any significant movements in FX."",
  ""Next, I wanted to give you the building blocks to our ambition to hit £1 billion revenue by FY 2030."",
  ""Energetics will add more than £170 million: £100 million for the expansion projects we've already announced, plus more than £70 million from the underlying business growing at mid-single digit CAGR."",
  ""Roke will have more than £100 million in revenue."",
  ""Roke grew 23% this year."",
  ""And whilst it won't be completely linear, we see Roke growing at a high-to-mid single-digit CAGR to £250 million in FY 2028 and then beyond."",
  ""US Sensors will have more than £30 million from the current baseline, stepping up to more than £55 million as JBTDS enters full rate production."",
  ""Countermeasures will add £25 million from low-single digit growth, and that's assuming there's no force deployment."",
  ""And then we'll add another £150 million from further capacity expansion in Energetics or through bolt on M&A. On margins, we've guided mid-teens in the medium term, that you can imagine, will add some significant revenue in our high margin businesses."",
  ""And so you'd expect some operational leverage in the longer term."",
  ""So that was the numbers."",
  ""One of our core values and something that has been one of my highlights since joining Chemring: visiting our businesses and learning about the amazing work we are doing."",
  ""We have over 1,000 people working at the cutting edge of technology."",
  ""We spend £150 million a year on R&D, of which about 90% is customer funded."",
  ""We are a key part of the supply chain for current and future missile systems, with our highly engineered components providing a critical function."",
  ""Our business in Chicago is well known for its pyro-actuation technology with strong relationships with all the major US primes."",
  ""We've recently been working on a new hypersonic missile program for the US Army and Navy, and we just qualified two devices: a bolt cutter to separate the glide body on the right and a pyro valve which releases gas to charge its guidance system on the left."",
  ""Our business in Scotland also supplies similar pyro-actuation technology to the European missile primes."",
  ""But Roke is also innovating in this area."",
  ""Accurately measuring how close you are to the ground is vital, even more so if you're an unmanned aerial vehicle."",
  ""The first iteration of the miniature radar altimeter solved this problem for low speed or hover applications."",
  ""But it soon became clear that terrain following and mapping required higher processing speed."",
  ""Roke have gone on to optimize the software and algorithms to perform in high maneuverability situations."",
  ""This ensures the platform can respond quickly to changes in altitude and cope with high velocities."",
  ""You can imagine, there are a number of applications for this technology from drones to long-range strike missiles."",
  ""Innovation always has been and always will be a key driver for the group."",
  ""That brings me to the end of my section."",
  ""I'll hand back to Mick for the strategy and outlook.""

  ""We are pleased to be here today to announce our nine months results 2024."",
  ""Basically, I will provide an overall picture, and then Reham, our CFO, will give you the details of the numbers."",
  ""Basically, we have been progressing in a steady manner all over our activities, mainly on the construction side, the different geographical diversified locations we have and on the concessions."",
  ""Regarding the concessions, we are happy to see the progress of our On the concessions, on the wind in Egypt, we have progressed in a great way."",
  ""The 500 megawatt that is currently under construction, we have already completed the Phase 1, which is 250 megawatt."",
  ""And currently, we are running the reliability tests, where we hope we complete that by the end of the month."",
  ""And this means that we are ready four months ahead of schedule."",
  ""In addition to that, we have succeeded to sign with the Egyptian government and add on 150 megawatt on the same site, where we are going to expand the 500 megawatt to become 650 megawatt, making it probably the largest in Africa, as far as wind farms are concerned."",
  ""Again, our target is to have the 150 megawatt operational by next summer."",
  ""On the construction side, we're having a healthy backlog."",
  ""It's $8 billion between the US and the Middle East."",

  ""And we are, as we have indicated before, focused on data centers, the aviation sector, where we are able to improve our bottom line."",
  ""Last but not least, BESIX has maintained a positive trajectory, a healthy backlog."",
  ""And we believe that BESIX will be continuing – will be delivering the expected results by end of the year and, obviously, better for 2025."",
  ""We are heading confidently in our diversification."",
  ""And soon, we will be having projects in the region to continue our strategy to diversify the MENA region and not to be dependent only on Egypt."",
  ""The other thing is that it's our intention to, before year end, we will announce a dividend to be paid to the shareholders in January 2025."",
  ""Now, I leave the floor to Reham so that she can walk you through the numbers."",
  ""First, I would like to take you through highlights of year-to-date group results."",
  ""Our consolidated backlog marked the $8 billion mark sustained by strong new awards of $2.6 billion year-to-date 2024, with the MEA/USA split of new awards of 53% to 47%."",
  ""Quality backlog and operational excellence allowing margin enhancement across the group, with an adjusted EBITDA margin for nine months of 2024 of 5.1% compared to 3.8% same period last year."",
  ""On net income margin as well, for the first nine months of 2024, margin recorded 3.7% compared to 3.1% same period last year as well."",
  ""Lastly, cash flow from operation for year-to-date 2024 marked $245 million of positive cash inflow compared to a negative of $90.7 million for the first nine months of 2023."",
  ""And now, focusing on our Q3 results for 2024, revenue reported a 5.1% increase year-on-year to $842.5 million in quarter three."",
  ""Excluding the deval effect, the revenue would have witnessed 17.2% increase year-on-year to $959 million driven by stronger operational improvement in both MEA and USA."",
  ""Excluding deval effect, MEA revenue increased 11% year-on-year for quarter three of this year on the back of contribution from newly awarded projects."",
  ""US operations also attained stable growth of 24.8% year-on-year, driven by higher contribution for newly awarded projects, mainly data centers, industrial and aviation."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA of the group recorded 34.7% year-on-year to $44.6 million in quarter three of 2024 and 31.4% year-on-year for $119 million for nine months of 2024."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA margin for MEA operations increased to 7.2% in quarter three of this year and 7.4% for the nine months of this year."",
  ""The group's performance in the US continued to improve, reflecting EBITDA growth of approximately 80% year-on-year in quarter three of 2024 and 81.7% year-on-year for the nine months of 2024."",
  ""EBITDA margin growth to 3.6% and 3.2% in Q3 and nine months of 2024, respectively."",
  ""The group's net income attributable to shareholders increased 34.2% year-on-year to $21.6 million in quarter three and 18.2% year-on-year to $86.3 million in nine months of 2024, a 3.7% margin compared to 3.1% margin for the nine months of 2023."",
  ""Net income contribution from BESIX increased to $5 million to $1 million in quarter three 2023."",
  ""Nine-month 2024 contribution from BESIX totaled $13.3 million compared to $7.4 million for same period last year."",
  ""Our investments in subsidiaries and building material, equipment services, facility management and concession accounted to close to 32% of group's net income in the first nine months of 2024."",
  ""Net income for this segment was driven by equipment services and steel fabrication subsidiary."",
  ""Our steel fabrication subsidiary continues to grow its export position and is supplying projects in USA, Europe, Africa and UAE."",
  ""Looking on our balance sheet, equity accounted entities amounts to $462.8 million, majority of which were $430 million ex BESIX."",
  ""The group's total equity decreased to $657.6 million as of 30th of September 2024, still at the healthy level, but primarily impacted by further reduction of reserves as a result of currency translation differences at the group subsidiary operating in Egypt and by the dividend distributed to shareholders earlier of $42.9 million."",
  ""This was partially absorbed by our profitability for the period."",
  ""On the working capital level, our nine-month 2024 cash flow from operating activities recorded $254 million as alluded to earnings due to strong collections and advances received in quarter one of this year, as well as gradual improvement in our collection, leading to cash inflows from operations in quarter three of 2024 for an amount of $6.3 million."",
  ""Trade and other receivables increased to $1.6 billion compared to December level of $1.3 billion, generated from strong profit on projects and billings in MEA and USA."",
  ""Trade and other payables balance and expenses remains at par and close to December 2023 levels of $1.4 billion as a result of EGP devaluation compensated by advances received for the newly awarded project."",
  ""Our gross debt stood at $299 million, closing September 2024 ahead of December level of $249.8 million."",
  ""The group is preserving a healthy net cash position of $419 million compared to $446 million in December of 2023."",
  ""We are now open for the Q&A session.""

  ""As we have indicated before that the expectations that we'll get feedback in Q1 next year."",
  ""We are expected to replenish, let's say, the backlog that we are eroding every quarter."",
  ""We think, we will be, give or take, in the same level by end of the year."",
  ""And we'll maintain that, give or take, 10% in 2025."",
  ""On the top line, I think, we believe, we'll have the same level or maybe even grow somewhere between 5% to 10%."",
  ""And on the bottom line, I think we are working diligently to continue to improve the levels of EBITDA and net profit."",
  ""And I think, we are getting in that direction."",
  ""Obviously, there are a lot of considerations to whether there would be another devaluation in Egypt or not."",
  ""So, it's very difficult to pinpoint something very specific, but I think we're confident that our bottom line will continue to improve."",
  ""We are maintaining the same level of dividends that we have processed in 2024."",
  ""And it will be, again, our expectations is to have an interim dividend in January and another one summer next year."",
  ""We are – our strategy has been, over the last couple of years, is to continue to grow, but also diversify geographically dependency of the group to be not only particularly on the MENA region, to be not only on Egypt alone."",
  ""We believe, we are on the right track that we will probably have, by end of 2025, an increased backlog in the MENA in Egypt."",
  ""And we'll have a better split between Egypt, the US, and let's say, the GCC."",
  ""On the US, we are maintaining organic growth as far as potential awards."",
  ""We will probably end this year at the level of $1.8 billion, $1.9 billion."",
  ""That will have two major components, which is data centers and aviation, plus other works scattered around the States."",
  ""We believe that backlog will grow slightly more by end of 2025."",
  ""As far as Ras El Hekma is concerned, we are working closely with the developer."",
  ""The current contract or agreement that we have with them focuses on fast-track, immediate needs as a developer."",
  ""I think once they have concluded their master plan, we will be seeing more defined projects."",
  ""And probably, they have indicated in their event in October that they want to develop 30% to 40% of the project in the next four years, which I would assume, there will be much more projects available for us and other contracts."",
  ""Well, actually, we are subject to the supply chain pressure that could happen, whether in Europe, or East Europe, or even in China or Asia."",
  ""I think that we will have to assess, at that time, what will affect that."",
  ""I mean, obviously, I think, there will be hint – I mean, there's a hint on the high-speed train."",
  ""But I know for a fact that Siemens is well ahead on the manufacturing of the trains."",
  ""Actually, the first train that will be shipped to Egypt was displayed in the transport conference in Berlin in September."",
  ""And actually, we have prepared, what they call in the railway business, a stabling yard ready for Siemens to start shipping by the end of the year."",
  ""I think that Siemens has secured a lot of their material needed for the manufacturing."",
  ""I wouldn't think that there will be a major impact, unless something dramatic happens."",
  ""As far as our construction work, not only on the high speed, in general, we are monitoring that."",
  ""We are even operating in spite of the fact that there are challenges in the Red Sea."",
  ""And obviously, like any operator, we kind of try to anticipate the issues and try to mitigate."",
  ""I mean, obviously, we hope we can improve on that, but definitely for guidance, totally agree."",
  ""Well, the operation on Australia is still ongoing."",
  ""I think that for 2024, they have made great progress as far as discipline and controls on the operation, and it starts to slightly contribute to the bottom line."",
  ""We believe that we'll even have a better contribution in 2025 and 2026."",
  ""I think, we can do that."",
  ""Obviously, one thing that we need to be aware in the US, that there is also the cyclicality of weather in the US."",
  ""You will see that during the first quarter of any year, because of the winter and snow, there are areas where there is lack of progress and, obviously, lack of EBITDA numbers."",
  ""But I would say that our average for 2024 could be kind of a floor for what we expect in 2025."",
  ""I think, our backlog in the Middle East and on the MENA region takes us easily somewhere between 18 to 24 months, fully utilized."",
  ""The way the business is managed in the US is slightly different."",
  ""We are always looking at somewhere between 9 and 12 months; to 12 months, maybe a little bit more than 14 months due to the nature of the market in the US where the client are once they commit a project, it goes and moves forward."",
  ""So, this is where we have as a cutoff."",
  ""But if we look numerically, with an $8 billion backlog, we're pretty much – easily, we have a 24 months ahead of us, fully utilized."",
  ""The backlog today – the contribution of the high-speed train in the backlog is as follows."",
  ""On the first phase, which what we call, the green line, probably, the current backlog is somewhere between €350 million, €400 million, give or take."",
  ""As far as the blue line, which is the second phase, which takes us from Cairo up to the borders and to the Red Sea, this is – we have not utilized any of that."",
  ""And the current – our share of current backlog is around €850 million, excluding operation and maintenance."",
  ""We're looking forward to meeting you again to share with you our end-year results sometime in March next year."",
  ""We'll start receiving questions on the webcast."",
  ""Our first question, any update on the Qatar Foundation Our next question, could you please share the outlook for backlog additions in 2025, plus guidance on top and bottom lines for full-year 2024 and 2025?"",
  ""Our next question, congratulations on the results."",
  ""Can you please explain where the FX loss and the comprehensive income is coming from?"",
  ""Is this expected to reoccur again in Q4?"",
  ""Well, this is a function of the cash balances that we – foreign currency that are related to our Our next question... Sorry, Hesham."",
  ""As a follow-up, it will depend on the movement between EGP versus dollar and euro, which is substantially the currencies of our foreign currency cash at operations level."",
  ""Our next question, congratulations on the results."",
  ""Can you shed some light on the proposed dividends?"",
  ""Can you please elaborate on your comments that you are looking to diversify the backlog?"",
  ""Can you shed some light on the outlook for new awards in the US and Ras El Hekma?"",
  ""Our next question, how far is the group, particularly BESIX, is exposed to the economic and political turmoil in Germany?"",
  ""Our next question, shall we use the current margins in Middle East and Africa and the US as guidance for 2025 and thereafter?"",
  ""Our next question, congratulations on the results."",
  ""Can you shed some light on BESIX operations in Australia and the scope of its expansion?"",
  ""Our next question, in Q3 2024, we witnessed one of the highest EBITDA margin for US business at 3.6%."",
  ""Could we expect that level to be maintained going forward or as guidance for 2025?"",
  ""Our next question, what are the current project lifetimes for our work in the Middle East, and Africa and the US?"",
  ""We got asked to clarify, could you repeat the parts of the high-speed electric train?"",
  ""We haven't received any further questions."",
  ""Have we received any by phone?""

  ""Everybody  for joining our presentation on CT Private Equity Trust."",
  ""This is a presentation of the Third Quarter Results, the three months to the end of September this year, and we will touch on progress in the year-to-date and the first nine months of the year."",
  ""So a couple of quick things to mention before I get into the presentation."",
  ""We have had basically a quiet couple of years in private equity in terms of growth that followed two very strong years prior to that."",
  ""We – so far this year, we're basically about flat in terms of NAV."",
  ""We were slightly down in this quarter, most of that was due to adverse currency movements."",
  ""We were actually up in underlying terms, and that is the first three quarters worth."",
  ""Bear in mind that the third quarter numbers basically are largely based upon June valuations because we have very few September valuations, when we compile the numbers, and we still haven't got very many."",
  ""So the final quarter, which will give the full year outcome that will be released at the end of March next year, we'll essentially have two quarters worth of valuation movements in that number."",
  ""So that's worth bearing in mind."",
  ""But I think we can get a good sense of how things are going so far this year."",
  ""I'm just going to take you through the slides."",
  ""The presentation should probably take a little bit more than half an hour, go through fairly quickly to give maximum time for questions afterwards."",
  ""Just to recap, those of you're not familiar with the company, it is a private equity fund of funds with nearly half the portfolio invested directly into private companies through co-investments."",
  ""We focus on the lower mid-market buyout sector in Europe with most of the portfolio invested in Continental Europe and in the UK, and we have a small amount in North America."",
  ""We, as I mentioned, have a significant component in co-investments."",
  ""The target is to get to 50%."",
  ""We're slightly below that at present, and we'd like to, to back emerging managers."",
  ""So these are up and coming private equity groups."",
  ""We think that the alignment of interest between us as investors, and they as managers and also with the underlying management is very close in that tier of the market, and that has worked out well for us."",
  ""The company has been going for over 25 years."",
  ""We have a very strong track record at or close to the top of our peer group, and I've been involved managing the portfolio throughout that entire period."",
  ""So just looking at the numbers that we've just announced this morning for the third quarter, as the NAV total return down 1% gives a year-to-date number of down 0.2%."",
  ""So essentially flat to all intents and purposes."",
  ""On a 12 month basis, we're actually slightly up 1.7%."",
  ""Now in the quarter, we had an adverse impact from exchange rate."",
  ""Essentially, the pound has been strong against both the euro and the dollar."",
  ""And we have about 60% of the portfolio is either in euro, shadow euro or dollar denominated investments."",
  ""So when the pound is strong that tends to detract from the sterling NAV."",
  ""And during the third quarter, there was a negative impact of about 1.5%, and there was a negative impact in the first half of about 1%."",
  ""So you've basically had about a negative 2.5% impact on the NAV just through currency in the year-to-date."",
  ""So if we didn't have that, we would be up."",
  ""And that has already reversed slightly in the current quarter, but it remains to be seen where we get to by the end of the year."",
  ""As I mentioned a minute ago, the third quarter number is largely based on June marks rather than September ones, about 8% would have been September."",
  ""So the vast majority still based on June, and we will therefore when we come to the full year, we'll have essentially two quarters worth in one quarter, which is why the final quarter – the full year valuation tends to quite often is quite a large movement."",
  ""I mean, obviously it depends on what's going on in the underlying portfolio, but it can be quite a big movement."",
  ""So that's worth bearing in mind."",
  ""Couple of points to emphasize in these numbers."",
  ""We had realizations in the third quarter of £42.2 million, which is quite strong."",
  ""New investments of only £9.3 million."",
  ""So that's smaller than usual."",
  ""The realizations in the year-to-date are running at £94.5 million, which is up about 75% on the equivalent period last year."",
  ""And so we would expect this year to finish with a very strong outcome in terms of realizations."",
  ""Now that is basically a good thing, because there is a reasonable correlation, a good correlation as you'd expect between realizations and NAV growth, because exits are generally at a significant premium to the immediate carrying value."",
  ""So although it doesn't always, the periods are always coincide precisely, if you have strong realizations, you're likely to get strong returns."",
  ""The dividend is maintained at £0.0701."",
  ""Just to remind you that dividend is paid out in four quarterly payments."",
  ""Each of those is 1% of the average of the previous four quarters' NAV."",
  ""If that number comes up to be a number below the previous dividend, we just maintain the previous dividend."",
  ""And with this kind of flattish period we've had, that is exactly what we're doing."",
  ""We're maintaining the previous dividend £0.0701, which means that the 12 month dividend is just over £0.28, which gives a yield on the current share price comfortably over 6%."",
  ""So just moving on to some of the events of the quarter and of the year-to-date, we've made one new commitment to a new private equity fund in the quarter."",
  ""That's Inflexion Enterprise Fund VI."",
  ""Those of you who follow the company will know that we have a number of investments with Inflexion, both funds and co-investments."",
  ""We've been backing them for over 20 years."",
  ""They are the sort of doyen, if you like, of the mid-market and private equity in the UK and increasingly in Europe, very successful firm, very strong returns and we will continue backing them as long as they continue to deliver great returns."",
  ""They've got about – they've got three sub-franchises, if you like."",
  ""So there's the main buyout fund business, and they will make investments up to about £400 million in those companies."",
  ""So proper mid-sized companies, they've also got a partnership capital fund, where they will invest in minority positions."",
  ""I mean, they don't – they will still have a high degree of control, but they typically have less than 50% of the equity."",
  ""And that franchise is work well for them."",
  ""And then they have the enterprise funds."",
  ""So the enterprise funds are looking at companies, where the enterprise value of the companies is between £50 million and £150 million, which is very close to our own sweet spot for our entire portfolio."",
  ""And it's also where Inflexion started out from and they've got a very strong record there."",
  ""So very pleased to be backing them again."",
  ""Just recapping on the major exits that we've had in the year-to-date, some of these I've mentioned in prior quarters."",
  ""So I'll just restate it briefly."",
  ""So Jollyes, which is a pet shop chain."",
  ""It's a large format pet retailer."",
  ""It's the second largest behind Pets at Home."",
  ""This is a deal that we invested in alongside Kester Capital in 2008."",
  ""It has grown very nicely over that period."",
  ""It had various things to cope with, I mean, it had COVID, but that turned out to be a good thing for pet shops because they were allowed to stay open all the way through COVID."",
  ""They've modernized this business where they bought it – when they bought it, it was a previous family business run by – it was run by its Finance Director, who bought the business."",
  ""And there were a lot of professionalization measures that Kester were able to implement centralized buying, which amazingly hadn't happened before, plus a new third-party distribution system, and various other improvements to the estate of stores."",
  ""And in fact, they increased the number of stores from 60 to 100 of the holding period."",
  ""And the business has grown very nicely over that period, and we made over 4 times cost, and a 27% IRR, when it was sold, and we got the money in April this year."",
  ""So in some ways a bit of a traditional company, chain of stores, but growing very well, modernized very nicely."",
  ""It was bought by TDR Capital, by the way, who own a significant stake in ASDA."",
  ""So they'll probably do something with ASDA."",
  ""Second exit here is Coretrax."",
  ""This is a deal led by Buckthorn, who are energy specialists."",
  ""Coretrax is an Aberdeen based business that is in the oil services sector, specifically it's wellbore clean up, plug and abandonment technology."",
  ""What does that mean, is basically technical piece of equipment that goes on top of the wells, it caps off the wells, controls pressure, that kind of thing."",
  ""There's an element of counter cyclicality here, because as oil wells are decommissioned, particularly, in the North Sea, you do actually need their technology to do that safely."",
  ""But you also need it when you are doing new exploration."",
  ""And they – during the holding period, acquired an American business called Mohawk, which allowed them to expand significantly into the American Permian Basin, the major oil presence – the oil province there."",
  ""This was acquired through the sale."",
  ""It was – they've sold to Expro, which is a listed – New York listed oil services company, it used to be a British company."",
  ""We actually backed this many years ago through Candover, but it's now a much, much bigger business."",
  ""And they bought it and most of the consideration was in shares."",
  ""Those shares have now been sold down."",
  ""The final return, 1.7 times cost and an IRR of 11%, which is a bit suboptimal for us, but it's not a bad return considering the volatility in that sector over the holding period with quite big fluctuations in the oil price."",
  ""So we regard this as a reasonable outcome."",
  ""Third major exit was ATEC."",
  ""ATEC is an insurance company."",
  ""It's a broker, but it also has its own managing general agent."",
  ""So they place underwriting with a panel of insurers."",
  ""They specialize in a niche of the market, which is caravans, small boats, beach huts, and that's a very sticky business, because once somebody has got the insurance for their boat or their caravan, they tend not to sort of shop around in the way they might do with car insurance."",
  ""This business has been, again, very professionalized, under Kester Capital."",
  ""The various portals, the route to market, the digitalization of it has all taken place and it's grown very nicely."",
  ""The gross written premiums have gone from under £25 million to £75 million during the whole period, which is seven years."",
  ""And its profitability has essentially gone up fourfold during the holding period."",
  ""It's now been sold to Perwyn, We've got the money in September, not allowed to tell you exactly how much we got, although you could probably work it out by looking at our RNS statement, but it's comfortably over 4 times cost."",
  ""So that's a great outcome."",
  ""This is the chart just showing of the long-term progression of our NAV and the cumulative dividends, which has been pretty good."",
  ""Obviously, it's been relatively quiet in the last year or so, but the long-term trend, which we think will be resumed fairly soon, is very positive."",
  ""And this is the share price and NAV over the entire company's existence."",
  ""We have been going for 25 years."",
  ""We had our 25th anniversary earlier in the year, complete with a sort of party at the stock exchange, where we got to press the closing bell or buzzer."",
  ""It's a buzzer, actually, which is good fun."",
  ""Important point is, if you look at the returns here compared to the stock market, that's the all share index, which is the gray dotted line."",
  ""It's miles in excess of what you would achieve in the stock market over that 25 year period, the gains that you would have made had you bought out shares and held them are over 4 times, what you would have made if you just invested in the all share index."",
  ""And therein lies, the argument behind investing in private equity and staying in private equity."",
  ""There's still a gap between the share price and the NAV total return."",
  ""Now that gap is wider than it usually is, and I would suggest that's a good opportunity for those of you looking to add to your holdings because that gap will narrow."",
  ""Looking at five year fund performance of various statistics here, which shows you that, as I said earlier, you've had some pretty punchy years in 2022 and 2021, much quieter in the last couple of years."",
  ""But hopefully that will change once we get through this phase of adjustment that's taken place in the private equity world."",
  ""Private equity world is still growing, by the way, and we're still making positive returns."",
  ""We have not gone ex-growth far from it."",
  ""This is the outstanding undrawn commitments."",
  ""Now we need to make these to make sure that we can maintain a fully invested portfolio, but the commitment level is very comfortable."",
  ""It's bang on the five year average at 39% of NAV."",
  ""So nothing out of the ordinary here."",
  ""And debt has come down a bit."",
  ""We had about £90 million of debt last quarter, but it's now gone down to £70 million."",
  ""We think we're in a very sort of comfortable zone."",
  ""It's about 12.6% geared at the moment."",
  ""Typically, we're sitting between about 10% and 20%."",
  ""If it's up towards 20%, that's on the high side and it tends to be temporary and we bring it down."",
  ""If it's below 10%, it's a bit low and therefore not going to make much of a contribution to returns."",
  ""So current range is fine."",
  ""We've got more to half our revolving credit facility available to use."",
  ""You need to keep a bit of headroom in it, obviously, but we've got plenty of scope there."",
  ""I mean, the – just going back to that, I mean, the long-term argument is that the returns that we expect to make by investing in private equity are going to be far in excess of the cost of debt, even with debt at a higher price than it has been for a while."",
  ""This is the – just the investments in 2024 to date, I'm not going to go through all of these individually, but they are diverse by geography and sector and lead manager."",
  ""We're always renewing the portfolio."",
  ""These are some of the recent co-investments, which I will just touch on."",
  ""Some of you have heard of a few of these before, so I won't labor the details."",
  ""Cyclomedia is, it's a Dutch based company that essentially maps areas using a LiDAR technology, and the maps are used by generally local authorities for the purposes of local taxation."",
  ""So business rates, that kind of thing."",
  ""Started in Holland, moved into Germany, moved into the US, and it is essentially a unique proposition and it's growing nicely."",
  ""The deal is led by Volpi, whom we've invested with for many years, and it's got off to good start, we've been in it for over a year, and it's nicely up already."",
  ""This one is Utimaco, which is led by the German host SGT Capital."",
  ""This is – provides security tokens and cybersecurity services."",
  ""So this is a strongly growing market, as you can imagine, growing at double digits and they already have a 5% to 10% global market share, which is growing."",
  ""So that's one of their devices that they're on the side."",
  ""And this has also got off to a good start."",
  ""This is another – quite a technology theme here actually, but this is, that's – the world we live in, I mean, technology is omnipresent."",
  ""This is a software company, it provides software for manufacturing processes, so already has a blue chip list of clients, it's a French company."",
  ""It – the software essentially improves the manufacturing process."",
  ""It makes things faster, less waste, less energy usage, that kind of thing."",
  ""The deal is led by Scottish Equity Partners, the growth equity investors."",
  ""We know them very well, obviously, because they're based in Glasgow and I've been backing them since 1996."",
  ""So we've got a very good idea of their capabilities and really confident that this will work well for them."",
  ""And then Educa Edtech, which is led by the Spanish group Aurica Capital, this is an online training company essentially."",
  ""It provides professional qualifications, master's degrees online, largely to the Spanish speaking world."",
  ""It's obviously started in Spain, but a lot of its customers are in Latin America."",
  ""This was bought quite a low price for this type of company."",
  ""We got in at below 7 times EV to EBITDA, which is sort of unheard of for this type of business, but mainly because Aurica had a good local angle on it."",
  ""And so that's also doing well."",
  ""Then we've got AccountsIQ, this is accounting software for smaller to medium sized companies."",
  ""It's a bit like Sage, but much smaller and probably more sophisticated."",
  ""And this deal was brought to us by Axiom."",
  ""So Axiom is an emerging manager that we've been backing for the last couple of years, their team come from Inflexion and from HgCapital one or two other places, and they specialize in software and technology enabled businesses."",
  ""And this one is the first deal we've done with them."",
  ""So plenty of opportunities for new deals."",
  ""We see a very good flow of co-investments."",
  ""This is actually the realizations in the year-to-date, you can see the multiples in the IRRs, and the sectors are very diverse sectors, different countries, different lead houses, quite a strong technology oriented theme."",
  ""Don't apologize for that, this is where people invest in private equity these days."",
  ""These are mature businesses that are all profitable, good revenue growth, profits growth."",
  ""This is not sort of loss making venture capital funded solely by their equity."",
  ""These are real businesses and therefore, people want to buy them."",
  ""And therefore, we make good returns."",
  ""And there's a few more of them on this page."",
  ""We're obviously rejuvenating the portfolio all the time, lots of new companies going into the portfolio."",
  ""Again, these often have a sort of information technology or healthcare angle, but not all of them."",
  ""I mean, we've got restaurants, chains and other things connected to the consumer and industrial sectors."",
  ""But there's a lot of software and healthcare, because collectively these two sectors account for about half the portfolio and has been a good driver of growth and gains for us."",
  ""This is the long-term pattern of distributions and drawdowns."",
  ""You can see, we actually a lot more distributions and drawdowns this quarter, which is basically a good thing."",
  ""But you can see how that fits into the long-term pattern."",
  ""The co-investment element we can control directly."",
  ""We didn't actually do any co-investments in the last quarter."",
  ""So that did help in terms of the balance sheet."",
  ""On the largest underlying holdings, a couple of things to watch out for, Sigma, which is an US based electronic components company Number three is Weird Fish, clothing company."",
  ""Some of you may have been at our Capital Markets Day in October, where we had David Butler, who's the new Chief Executive, presenting on this one."",
  ""So this business is growing quite nicely."",
  ""So we may be able to exit this next year, not sure, but that's a possibility, which would be good."",
  ""TWMA, this process is drill cuttings from oil rigs."",
  ""This suffered a bit during COVID."",
  ""It was difficult to mobilize their equipment and get it out to the various different provinces."",
  ""So it's still at 1 times cost, but I think Buckthorn are trying hard to sell that at a premium over the next year."",
  ""The fifth one is San Siro or HOFI, which is our funeral homes business in Italy, which we are largely out of."",
  ""We've sold three quarters of it."",
  ""We've held on to a quarter."",
  ""So this quarter is still worth £10 million and we've made 8 times of money already on the original deal."",
  ""So that's going pretty well."",
  ""Aurora Payments is an American payments company led by Corsair, which is still quite early in the holding period."",
  ""We've still got a bit of work to do there, but it's going okay."",
  ""Utimaco and Cyclomedia, I've mentioned to you, ninth is Cyberhawk, which is our Livingston based drone company, which has been doing really well building out its client base mainly in the energy sector and we're optimistic that will be able to be exited in 2025."",
  ""And then we have Breeze, which is the – essentially makes sophisticated fume cabinet that's still in a buildup phase, still quite early in the holding period."",
  ""So lots of interesting things there, the top 10 holdings only account for about 20% of the portfolio."",
  ""So lots of other things well below these, which have got great prospects as well."",
  ""In terms of the geographic and vintage year split, this hasn't changed significantly 42% in the UK."",
  ""This is a far higher exposure to the UK than any of our peers."",
  ""Most of them have hardly got anything in the UK."",
  ""I'm talking about the fund of funds peers and we still think there's a lot to go for in the UK."",
  ""Hopefully, Rachel Reeves is listening to this and noting it that there are people that already do put a lot of their money into the home market and we're one of them."",
  ""Most of the rest is in Continental Europe, although we have a significant 17% position in the States, because we've got some excellent relationships and investments there."",
  ""In terms of vintage year, we have a steadily maturing portfolio, more than half the portfolio is over four years old, 60% over three years old."",
  ""The usual investment thesis is around a four year hold normally, in actual fact, it turns out to be a wee bit longer than that, but after three or four years, you are preparing a company for sale."",
  ""So the proportion that's over three or four years old is a proxy for your stock of future realizations."",
  ""And we've got plenty coming down the track."",
  ""In terms of the valuation, it's on an enterprise value to EBITDA basis 11 times."",
  ""Again, this is quite a lot lower than our peer group, many of whom are much, much higher than that."",
  ""And the entry enterprise value to EBITDA of the current portfolio is about 8.7 times, which is in line with our long-term average, and is actually a really good, if you can buy a business, the good quality growing mid-market buyout in Europe now at 8.7 times are doing pretty well, not very heavily indebted, just over 3 times debt to EBITDA."",
  ""So underneath all these holdings, you don't have lots of precarious gearing."",
  ""I mean, you do have some gearing because they're management buyouts, but it's not particularly high."",
  ""So the capital structures are not risky."",
  ""This is the sectoral split."",
  ""As I mentioned earlier, nearly half the portfolio is in healthcare and information technology, but we have got significant amount in consumer discretionary industrials, business services as you'd expect."",
  ""The portfolio is deliberately well diversified because private equity is naturally risky."",
  ""And the only reliable way of reducing that inherently high risk down to moderate levels is through building and holding a well-diversified portfolio."",
  ""And that's exactly what we have here."",
  ""So to conclude, the portfolio is broadly based."",
  ""Nearly half the portfolio is in these long-term growth sectors of information technology and healthcare."",
  ""We're seeing excellent deal flow and in most of it's at good prices."",
  ""Pricing has moderated a bit recently."",
  ""You tend to get this when you have a quiet phase, if you are having a quiet phase, which we did have until, but out of this year, it means that buyers and sellers are not coming together because prices haven't adjusted."",
  ""Pricing is now adjusting, and hence we're seeing a big increase in realizations."",
  ""We're up by three quarters on last year, and that we'd expect to continue into the final quarter."",
  ""We've got plenty of borrowing facilities in place, which allows us to take opportunities, whether they're – whether or not, they're funded by realizations more capacity."",
  ""So we're in a good position to continue to build the foundations for future growth."",
  ""And with this big uplift in exits, very healthy, and there's a good uplift on exit over the previous carrying value was 22% on a weighted average basis year-to-date in 2024, that's a little bit below the premium last year, but I think that will build as we go further into the year."",
  ""Lots of people want to invest in private equity."",
  ""It's an excellent long-term asset class."",
  ""It's got a very strong record of delivering returns and indeed our company has as well."",
  ""And as we come to the end of 2024, look into 2025, we're very confident we'll continue to grow value for shareholders in the short and medium-term and longer-term as well."",
  ""So that's the end of the formal presentation."",
  ""I think we're about 35 minutes in."",
  ""So we've got a bit of time for questions.""
]","[
  ""It's Peter Brown here from Investment Trust Sales team."",
  ""We've got a few questions come in."",
  ""We'll try and run through them as quick as we can, obviously give some good thorough answers as well."",
  ""The first one was a pre-submitted question regarding the discount, you did mention it, and the fact that is a very good opportunity to buy assets Yeah."",
  ""Well, people saying, what am I doing about it?"",
  ""I mean, I actually can't magically eliminate the discount just by thinking about it."",
  ""We basically need to encourage new buyers of the shares and pointing out the conspicuous value that there is there at the moment is one of the things that we're doing."",
  ""We're upping our marketing, our PR, I mean, our target market, our wealth managers and other forms of retail investor, but we also appeal to institutions as well."",
  ""The discount should narrow as NAV growth picks up again."",
  ""We've been quite active buying back earlier in the year when the discount was about this level."",
  ""We're not going to use tons of the company's capital to do buybacks because that would have an impact on the balance sheet, but we will where we think it's going to be helpful to the share price."",
  ""For example, if there is a big loose line of stock coming out, we will and have used our buyback powers to do that."",
  ""It also – it gives a nice enhancement to NAV, but the amounts of money involved are quite small."",
  ""So basically encouraging new buyers for the shares is the most constructive thing we can do."",
  ""I don't believe there are clever discount protection mechanisms that work over the long-term."",
  ""Very much my ambition to make sure this company is much better rated, and we have been at a premium in the past, not often, but a couple of times in the company's life."",
  ""And I – my sort of sincere ambition is to get us up there, again."",
  ""So that we can actually issue stock."",
  ""And once you get into a position, where you're at a premium, you can issue stock, you can tend to – the other side of is, you can tend to buyback quite regularly and maintain that premium rating."",
  ""None of my peers are on a premium rating."",
  ""I mean, most of them are on at least the same type of discount that we are on."",
  ""Typically, we've had a narrower discount than the peers because our dividend is much better, and probably more reliable than theirs."",
  ""And so I think we're slightly anomalously cheap at the moment."",
  ""Well, we're significantly cheap, but we're anomalously cheap compared to some of the others."",
  ""I think that the sector itself is on quite a big discount and it's difficult to stand out from the crowd."",
  ""But going back to the NAV, we've got a shareholder here that's happy with the steady dividend, but keen to see improvements in NAV growth and new investments."",
  ""So obviously, you've mentioned about the last 12, 18 months being a fairly stable but unremarkable period for that."",
  ""What steps are planned to boost the company growth and NAV performance?"",
  ""As realizations pick up and we've seen them begin to pick up quite strongly this year that will drive NAV growth."",
  ""I mean, it doesn't actually happen immediately, but it will drive it."",
  ""Underlying profitability of the companies ultimately comes through, and we don't have the numbers for the first nine months of the year, but from the presentations I've been at, underlying profitable – profitability growth is good."",
  ""I mean, it is very robust."",
  ""It has been all the way through."",
  ""So ultimately that will exert itself and you'll see NAV growth and therefore, share price growth will come through."",
  ""We're always laying foundations for growth."",
  ""So at any given point in time, you've got quite a bit of new investment in the portfolio, and that takes time to deliver growth there, and even it does come through and if you look at our long-term record, you can see that it has come through very steadily over the 25 years."",
  ""So be patient and we will deliver."",
  ""And staying on NAV theme, a question comes in, what explains the discrepancy between EBITDA growth and NAV growth?"",
  ""Should the NAV grow in line with EBITDA growth?"",
  ""Well, it would if the valuation multiple was completely stable all the time."",
  ""It has been under a bit of pressure in the last couple of years."",
  ""So that's one of the reasons, where you may get a bit of a discrepancy."",
  ""But over – yeah, over the long-term, you will get NAV growth which is closely correlated with EBITDA growth."",
  ""It won't be exactly the same, but it will be closely correlated."",
  ""And our companies are delivering good EBITDA growth."",
  ""So this is why I'm confident about the medium-term."",
  ""And we can't go very far without talking about UK budget, unfortunately, possibly, but do you believe the government's decision to increase employer national contributions, national insurance contributions from April 2025 will impact the value of much of UK part of portfolio?"",
  ""I don't think it will impact much of the UK portfolio."",
  ""There are individual companies, where it's more significant, particularly those that employ a lot of people."",
  ""So we have got quite a few companies that are in the sort of the care sector."",
  ""Sensitivity to wages and inflation, et cetera, is one of the things that we consider when we go into these businesses."",
  ""What will happen is that they've all had their costs go up quite significantly."",
  ""And so they will have to pass that on in increased prices or fees that they charge, which may end up being inflationary for the economy, but that will be their natural reaction."",
  ""And to the extent that the end customer is at the state, which is in some of these companies, the government's just making a rod for its own back, I mean, it's pushing up costs, it's pushing up minimum wages."",
  ""And those wages are then – a lot of them are having to be paid by the public sector."",
  ""So it's a bit of a circular trip."",
  ""Many of our companies have got very substantial margins, particularly in the software area, and they don't have much in the way of employees."",
  ""So without sounding like I'm saying, I'm all right, Jack, I mean, it is not – it's not a good thing this, but it's not a disaster far from it."",
  ""We've got a well-diversified portfolio."",
  ""I mean, it's not – I mean, as anybody who's been following current affairs for the last few weeks will know that there's been a big backlash from industry over this, because they weren't anticipating it."",
  ""And it's quite a blunt instrument."",
  ""It adds to the costs of every organization that employs people."",
  ""It's not a tax on profits, because this is just adding to costs, which is actually all things being equal, reducing profits."",
  ""So obviously, if I've been the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I would find other ways of raising the money, but fortunately I'm not."",
  ""You've got enough on your plate with your day job, I think."",
  ""Could you give some of commentary, please, where do you think the best opportunities are at the moment?"",
  ""Is it primary, secondary or co-investments?"",
  ""Well, I mean, the opportunities right the way across that."",
  ""We tend to find that the secondary market, which we are quite active in, because we have two separate secondaries fund, is quite cyclical."",
  ""The price that you can achieve does fluctuate a bit."",
  ""I think it's improving in secondaries."",
  ""Actually, I have seen some quite interesting pricing being offered."",
  ""Co-investments, we see a steady stream of opportunities as we do in primaries."",
  ""We're in a stage in the cycle, where we've come out or we are coming out of a kind of, it wasn't really a recession, but it was a kind of weak period."",
  ""That the last quarter's GDP growth in the UK wasn't brilliant."",
  ""But before that it was quite obvious we were having a recovery."",
  ""And when you invest in the wake of a weak period, you tend to buy quite well."",
  ""And that opportunity will persist for a bit."",
  ""And then those businesses grow into a sort of strengthening economic background."",
  ""And so I think now over the next year 18 months will be a really good time to be making new investments."",
  ""There's a question about the Capital Markets Day that you mentioned."",
  ""Is there a recording available if you missed it?"",
  ""I think I could probably I think, it's on the web, it's on the website."",
  ""There are certain snippets on the website."",
  ""So certainly, go to the CT Private Equity in Columbia Threadneedle's website and there'll be quite a few videos there."",
  ""There won't be the full session because obviously it's about 2.5 hours long, but there's certainly material been put on the website for you."",
  ""I encourage you to look at that because apart from me riveting on, you get to hear from the management of some of the underlying companies and you also get to hear from a number of the other members of my team."",
  ""You mentioned private equity as a sector invests more and more in technology."",
  ""Is that a function of the available opportunities or is there a risk of herd mentality?"",
  ""I don't think, it's herd mentality."",
  ""I think it's just because technology is becoming perennial and pervasive across the economy in the modern world."",
  ""We saw a lot of acceleration of the digitalization of society during COVID for obvious reasons."",
  ""We also saw the importance of good health and healthcare was highlighted during that period as well."",
  ""So that probably gave a bit of an impetus, but it was really an impetus to something that was already going on because private equity likes to invest in sectors that offer secular growth, whether it's a trend that lasts more than a few years and you can see it going forward because even if you can't predict it really accurately, within a year or two, if you're over a 5 or 10 year period, some of these trends are very clear."",
  ""So provided you don't overpay badly, you'll probably do quite well."",
  ""So – and also I think private equity has become more clued up in terms of technologies."",
  ""The expertise across the sector is quite a lot deeper."",
  ""I mean, in the old days, the classic private equity guy saw himself as a bit of a natural deal doer."",
  ""They just thought they were actually geniuses at negotiating deals."",
  ""Now that certainly one part of the skills that you'd require actually knowing and understanding the technologies and the dynamics of technology oriented companies is, in my view, just as important as being able to decide, whether something is cheap or not."",
  ""And a lot of these companies that we go into, I mean, some of them are so complicated that you really have to spend a lot of time trying to work out what they actually do."",
  ""And I have a simple rule, which is, if I don't understand how they make money, or my team can't understand it and explain it to me, then we won't invest in it."",
  ""But fortunately, I've got some quite clever people in the team."",
  ""So they're generally able to do that, and to articulate the opportunities."",
  ""So I think we'll see more, not necessarily a bigger percentage, but we will see a many more technology oriented businesses coming into the portfolio over the years."",
  ""There's a couple of questions on dividends."",
  ""Obviously, we're proud of the dividend, and it's a big part of why someone should own this trust."",
  ""I'll merge two questions together."",
  ""If realizations dried up, would you use gearing to fund dividends?"",
  ""And the second question is, can the current dividends be maintained over the next three to five years?"",
  ""The dividends can be maintained."",
  ""The dividend is set at a level that we are very confident we can pay under just about any foreseeable circumstances."",
  ""So it costs us £20 million a year."",
  ""The portfolio is over £500 million in gross terms."",
  ""So it's going to generate a lot more than £20 million a year and a bit more to cover our expenses."",
  ""So we've set it at 4% because we believe that's a level that we can maintain a come hell or high water, really."",
  ""So the situation you're asking about if we had, less than £10 million – less £20 million of realizations, would we use gearing to pay the dividend?"",
  ""Well, the answer is probably, yes."",
  ""But I think it's a very unlikely situation for us to be in."",
  ""If we are in that situation that would mean that we have probably mismanaged the company, and we don't intend to start doing that now."",
  ""What was the other bit of the question, Peter?"",
  ""Well, I think you've answered it, would you use gearing Yeah."",
  ""It's been set at a sustainable level."",
  ""When we put that dividend policy in back in 2012, we looked at different ways of allowing our shareholders to benefit from the realizations that we would always have coming through."",
  ""We could have done tender offers, we could have done irregular special dividends."",
  ""We could have said, we will distribute a set proportion of realizations."",
  ""The problem with those things, apart from being quite complicated, they were quite difficult to make – it was quite difficult to make sure that all shareholders benefited from them."",
  ""And also the amount that we were going to distribute would be very difficult to predict."",
  ""Even I would find it difficult to predict one quarter to the next what the exact realization total would be."",
  ""But with our current dividend policy, at any given point in time, you're only missing one piece of information, which is the final quarter's NAV."",
  ""And even if you don't know that for sure that the dividend will be at least this, the level it was in the previous quarter."",
  ""So it's highly predictable and basically our investors like that."",
  ""They know that they're going to get their quarterly check and they know the minimum size of that check."",
  ""Two questions I'm going to merge together, but bizarrely they're sort of counteract each other."",
  ""One is, equity markets has been very strong, have been very strong this year."",
  ""Why have private equity funds struggled to grow NAV in this environment?"",
  ""And the second part is, what explains the long-term outperformance of private equity in your opinion?"",
  ""Is it likely to continue well into the next step?"",
  ""Well, the long-term performance of private equity is because it's a – it's got a very strong alignment between investors and management."",
  ""And when you've got that alignment of interest, it tends to work."",
  ""So the management of the companies, who know about running these companies, they benefit when there's growth, the private equity managers benefit, the underlying investors, us and you also benefit."",
  ""They do their research upfront."",
  ""They're operating in a market, where the information they're gathering is not public."",
  ""So they have a natural advantage over anyone else."",
  ""And the trick in private equity is to find out information that other people – well, it's to find information other people don't have, and then to draw conclusions from that information that other people haven't yet drawn."",
  ""And then to do that consistently, and you provide capital to management buyout."",
  ""So quite often the key determinant of whose capital they receive is the management team of the underlying company."",
  ""And they've got a very strong eye on not just the price of that capital, but also what comes with that capital, the expertise that comes with it."",
  ""Because if you are Inflexion, you've done dozens of deals and the management of those companies have all made good money personally, a management team will see that and they will think, I should have the money from Inflexion because they'll bring expertise that will allow me to grow this business rapidly, and I'll make a good capital gain for myself."",
  ""And so they will not necessarily source the cheapest capital."",
  ""The cheapest capital might come from some faceless bank."",
  ""And so if they need help growing the business, they won't be able to give them any help, they'll just be asking them for the interest payments."",
  ""So private equity is capital that comes with expertise."",
  ""And if you are good at private equity, you will be able to win deals, where you are not offering the cheapest capital."",
  ""In other words, you'll be getting in at a good price."",
  ""And if you do this often enough, you have a sustainable advantage over other people, which is, why there's persistence of performance of private equity, which is very rare in other asset classes."",
  ""So you've got an efficiency, expertise that goes alongside the capital."",
  ""Very few companies, as a proportion of all companies actually receive private equity."",
  ""So there's a massive sort of sifting exercise, as a cherry picking exercise that goes on, and that's why private equity outperforms, and it will continue to perform."",
  ""And our company's one of the ways that you can get that exposure immediately and simply just by buying shares."",
  ""I'm getting close to the hour now."",
  ""So I think we'll make this the final question, but it's quite an interesting one, I think."",
  ""10% of portfolio value is 2016 vintage or older."",
  ""Can you speak a little about the kinds of investments in this bracket, and why it's Yeah."",
  ""So fairly enough, not every investment that we invest in works at 100% according to plan."",
  ""So sometimes there – they have to have a second or third plan, and that sort of older part of the portfolio, that's normally what that is."",
  ""It's normally where the original plan, which would be based around a four year or five year hold, has not been implemented for whatever reason."",
  ""It doesn't necessarily mean the company's been a complete failure, it may just mean that things have taken longer than expected."",
  ""And so they can have – they regroup, they re-plan, where there is actually value in the – in our valuation."",
  ""It means that these are live businesses, and where there is good prospects."",
  ""Now we did an analysis, I haven't got all the details in my head, but we did an analysis looking at the old, the sort of rump, if you like, the older bit of the portfolio."",
  ""Did it actually, ultimately become realized and what were the returns from that bit to the portfolio?"",
  ""And the interesting thing is that most of these companies were returned with nice positive returns."",
  ""The IRRs were lower than the core part of the portfolio, but they weren't bad."",
  ""They were in the sort of teens."",
  ""So that is definitely worth managing and hanging onto, if the companies were real kind of draws, which I think is probably what you're thinking."",
  ""We wouldn't be – they wouldn't have any significant value that would have been written down."",
  ""So there are companies and funds that have sort of late period blossoming."",
  ""And that's what that bit of the valuation represent."",
  ""And  everyone for your questions."",
  ""We will get round to answering all questions been asked on the website."",
  ""So check in after the next 24, 48 hours, and hope you're getting answered to the questions, I haven't asked today."",
  ""But Hamish, if I can just ask you for some final comments on the Trust."",
  ""I think, we've had a period of adjustment in the private equity market in the last couple of years."",
  ""I think we're coming to the end of that now."",
  ""We're seeing good signs with the increasing flow of realizations."",
  ""At the same time, we see a good flow of new opportunities to invest."",
  ""So I think we're getting into a period where normal service will be resumed in 2025."",
  ""I think the opportunities for people to add to their holdings now are obvious."",
  ""One of the points I didn't make earlier was that when the market goes into a kind of risk off mode, discounts and private equity trusts tend to widen."",

  ""Certain information to be discussed during this call contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable security law, including, among others, statements concerning the company's 2024 objectives, the company's strategy to achieve those objectives, as well as statements with respect to management's beliefs, plans, estimates, and intentions, and similar statements concerning anticipated future events, results, circumstances, performance, or expectations that are not historical facts."",
  ""Such forward-looking statements reflect management's current beliefs and are based on information currently available to management, and are subject to several significant risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated."",
  ""Also, our commentary today will include adjusted financial measures, which are non-GAAP measures."",
  ""These should be considered as supplement, not a substitute, for GAAP financial measures."",
  ""Reconciliations between the two can be found in our MD&A, which is available on sedarplus.ca, and our website."",
  ""At this time, it is my pleasure to introduce Adam Adamou, Chief Executive Officer of OverActive Media."",
  ""Today, I'll briefly review our third quarter financial results and our performance for the first nine months of 2024."",
  ""Please note that the financial information we discuss today is prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards and is in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise indicated."",
  ""We will also present normalized figures to provide a clearer, more comparable view of our financials performance."",
  ""Normalized figures take into account timing discrepancies in the recognition of certain league revenues that vary year-over-year and providing a smoother and clearer comparison for analyzing our operational success and financial health."",
  ""In the third quarter of 2024, OverActive Media posted total revenue of CAD 6.9 million, representing a 14% increase from CAD 6 million in the same quarter last year."",
  ""And on a normalized basis, adjusting for changes in revenue recognition to reflect a more consistent financial performance quarter-to-quarter, revenue increased by CAD 2.9 million or 72%."",
  ""This growth is driven by full quarter contributions from our strategic acquisitions of Movistar Riders and KOI, along with continued excellence in our team operations and business operations segments, including notable contributions from digital merchandise or MTX sales."",
  ""Year-to-date, our total revenues reached CAD 17.2 million, up 49% compared to CAD 11.5 million in the same period in 2023."",
  ""Normalized revenue, which accounts for the straight line recording of certain league revenues, has increased by 59%, reflecting an additional CAD 6.3 million in revenue."",
  ""These strong figures highlight the ongoing success of our strategic initiatives and strong performance across our league and partnership engagements."",
  ""Our adjusted gross profit for the quarter, which reflects the net revenue after deducting direct costs, remained robust at CAD 5.1 million, with an adjusted gross margin of 74% compared to CAD 4.8 million and 80% for the same period in 2023."",
  ""On a normalized basis, adjusted gross profit improved significantly from CAD 2.8 million to CAD 5.1 million, and then adjusted gross margin increased from 71% to 74%."",
  ""This consistency in adjusted gross profit underscores the success of our revenue growth initiatives, driven by digital merchandise sales and contributions from our expanded portfolio."",
  ""These results highlight the scalability of our business model as we capitalize on strategic opportunities to achieve sustainable long-term profitability."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit for the first nine months of the year reached CAD 12.2 million, with an adjusted gross margin of 71%, compared to CAD 7.7 million and 67% during the same period in 2023."",
  ""On a normalized basis, year-to-date adjusted gross profit saw significant growth, improving from CAD 7 million to CAD 12.2 million, while adjusted gross margin increased from 65% to 71%."",
  ""This impressive growth reflects the scalability of our model, again, driven by the same merchandise sales and expanded team contributions."",
  ""Our operating costs for the quarter were CAD 7.6 million and up 42% over the same period in 2023."",
  ""This increase remains consistent and is primarily driven by integration costs and costs with our expanding operations."",
  ""Our commitment to cost management is critical, as we continue to integrate and scale our business operations efficiently."",
  ""And as of September 30, 2024, our year-to-date operating costs had totaled CAD 22.4 million, that reflects a 30% increase from the CAD 17.3 million in the same period last year."",
  ""This rise in operating expenses is due to investments in our team and corporate operations to support our growing business."",
  ""Additionally, the integration of our recent acquisitions, Movistar Riders and KOI, has brought about necessary expenses that contribute to this increase."",
  ""While we have seen a rise in cost, it's important to note that these investments are essential for supporting the expanded scope of our operations and are aligned with our strategic and financial goals to bolster our market position and enhance our competitive offerings."",
  ""Moreover, our commitment to strategic cost management remains unwavering."",
  ""We are continuously working to optimize our operations and extract efficiencies wherever possible."",
  ""By closely monitoring and judiciously managing these costs, we aim to ensure that our increased expenditures translate into value creation and contribute positively to our bottom line."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was slightly breakeven compared to an adjusted EBITDA gain of CAD 777,000 in the same quarter last year."",
  ""On a normalized basis, this represents a substantial improvement from the CAD 1.2 million loss in Q3 to a gain – Q3 loss in 2023 to a gain in 2024."",
  ""This improvement was driven by increased revenues from strategic acquisitions, successful team performances in key tournaments, and changes in revenue recognition from certain league revenues."",
  ""Furthermore, this turnaround is a testament to our focused revenue growth and strategic cost management, emphasizing our ability to convert revenues into increased – to increases in real profitability improvements."",
  ""And for the nine months ending September 30, 2024, our adjusted EBITDA loss was CAD 3.3 million, a 45% improvement from the CAD 5.5 million loss recorded in the same period last year."",
  ""This improvement reflects strong revenue growth from, again, the same strategic acquisitions, the revenue recognition adjustments and are partially offset by increased costs associated with the integration and restructuring of the acquisitions."",
  ""Our cash position as of September 30, 2024 was CAD 8.9 million, with net working capital improving to CAD 9.4 million."",
  ""That's compared to a net working capital of CAD 4.3 million last year, a total improvement of 321%."",
  ""The strong liquidity position supports our strategic flexibility and our ability to pursue growth opportunities with a high degree of discipline."",
  ""As Adam mentioned earlier, subsequent to the quarter, we restructured our League of Legends, European Championship agreement in a move that significantly strengthens our balance sheet by eliminating CAD 2 million in future franchise obligations."",
  ""This restructuring not only clears substantial liabilities, but also secures complete ownership of our franchises."",
  ""This enhancement simplifies our financial commitment and bolsters our capacity for strategic investments and operational agility."",
  ""To summarize, these results continue to demonstrate our commitment to operational excellence and our agility in a dynamic market, positions us for sustained growth and profitability."",
  ""That concludes our prepared remarks, and I'd like to pass it back to Adam Adamou.""

  ""Welcome to everybody who is joining."",
  ""We're just going to wait 30 seconds or so."",
  ""There's been an awful lot of interest in this presentation, so we'll just let everybody get on before we get underway."",
  ""So, please bear with us."",
  ""Just a couple of points of admin for people who might not have used Zoom before."",
  ""The company will present and then try and deal with your questions and you can submit those through the question button that you will see at the bottom of your page."",
  ""The presentation is being recorded, so if you miss anything, you should be able to see it in a day or two's time."",
  ""And the materials that Ian and Karen will be speaking to are available along with a lot of other materials on the Impax website, which I commend to you."",
  ""We are delighted to be joined again by CFO, Karen Cockburn; and the CEO and Founder of Impax, Ian Simm."",
  ""And I shall now pass over to Ian to start the presentation."",
  "", Andy, and hello, everybody."",
  ""So, without further ado, we just launch into the first slide, the one after that one."",
  ""So just to go through an introduction for those who maybe don't know the firm."",
  ""So, Impax is a investment manager serving institutional and wholesale clients around the world."",
  ""We manage just over £37 billion in equities, fixed income and private markets."",
  ""Been around since I founded the business in 1998 and we are running offices all around the world, so UK, Ireland, Denmark, the US."",
  ""We have two offices at Hong Kong and Japan."",
  ""And we have a partnership approach which has meant that we've had very, very long-term relationships with many very sophisticated clients."",
  ""So, Impax stands out because of its investment philosophy."",
  ""We believe that there's a quite a material economic transformation underway, if you like, an industrial revolution, which is driven by technology change, regulatory change, and changing consumer sentiment in the direction of what we call a more sustainable economy, which in simple terms is all about efficiency, low pollution and better products and services."",
  ""So, this industrial revolution is providing great amounts of growth and also turmoil and opportunities and the mispricing or benefiting from mispricing in both public markets and in private markets."",
  ""So, that's a great backdrop for our investment management style."",
  ""And we started with very modest beginnings."",
  ""So, a £15-million mandate with the World Bank got us going and today, we are £37 billion."",
  ""So, you can see the assets under management of each one of the financial years."",
  ""We actually went on to the AIM, the alternative investment markets reverse in 2001."",
  ""So, been a listed company for 23 years."",
  ""So, just a summary of the results ending the 30th of September 2024, we have been operating in quite choppy and challenging markets."",
  ""I'm sure everybody who's an investor will appreciate that it's been a very unusual couple of years with the rise of the magnificent seven and mega-cap tech stocks."",
  ""It's quite significant political uncertainty and the uncertainty around inflation and interest rates, which at the moment are both trending downwards."",
  ""We've been continuing to invest in the medium-term potential of the firm, adding more investment capabilities, launching more products and expanding our distribution."",
  ""And I'm pleased to say that the results has been a flat assets under management, very, very slightly down, but essentially flat over these 12 months despite active management being an area of quite considerable stretch and stress."",
  ""The financial numbers, Karen will go into but revenue and operating margin worth noting."",
  ""So operating margin still in the 30s and it's been quite a good – a very good result, commendable result and a dividend which is the same as last year, £0.276 for the year which is flat but very nicely covered and slightly greater cash reserves."",
  ""So, the backdrop to our investment work is summarized here."",
  ""We do think that equity market sentiment remains robust."",
  ""There's of course been quite a lot of uncertainty in the last three weeks since the US election."",
  ""But with the experience of the first Trump administration and Trump's statements so far, we think that the central scenario for equities for the next 12 months and beyond is positive and actually for the stocks we're investing in, very positive, given the strong likelihood that a delayed mean reversion, i.e., rerating of quality growth companies will take place."",
  ""So, in that sense, we are expecting that relatively high volatility will persist but that interest rates will not go higher materially and may well continue to drift downwards."",
  ""And in that context, the Impax investment philosophy around the transition to a more sustainable economy is very well positioned, we believe, given its very attractive valuation, strong fundamentals and our approach to what you might call no nonsense common sense investing rather than getting lost in ideas like ESG or impact investing, which is not what we do."",
  ""That Impax discipline is very much valued by our clients."",
  ""So, our investment performance over the period has remained very strong on an absolute basis."",
  ""You can see that in the second bullet point, the absolute returns of our major strategies on a relative basis compared to generic indices like the Morgan Stanley All Country World Index or ACWI Index, and we have been behind for second year."",
  ""That really reflects de-rating rather than weak earnings."",
  ""And as this situation we found ourselves in, in which the portfolios we're running are increasingly compelling on an absolute intrinsic value basis, but we're just waiting for the catalyst for the rerating."",
  ""Going up to the US election, those catalysts appear to be materializing, and I think we're probably on pause at the moment as market digests the policy uncertainty coming out of the US."",
  ""So, we've got – we'll follow now with the updates on a number of slides you probably have seen in the past if you followed Impax for a few years."",
  ""So, we start on the right-hand side of this chart."",
  ""You can see the assets under management, £37.2 billion at the end of September."",
  ""And the journey of getting there over the two preceding six-month periods shown starting from September 2023 on the far left."",
  ""So, this is self-explanatory, but you can see outflows greater than inflows."",
  ""So, the net outflows have been material but offset almost exactly by positive investment performance."",
  ""And we have acquired some assets in the last six months, which I'll mention in a moment."",
  ""A breakdown of our business in a standard Impax format."",
  ""So top left, equities in thematic and core equity categories, showing that core equities have continued to increase as a percentage of the total assets fixed income."",
  ""And geographically, the bottom left, we've had a slight increase on a relative basis by – or with the UK and North America at the expense of the EMEA region."",
  ""The bottom right shows that once again the relative revenue for BNP Paribas, one of our largest distribution partners, has continued to fall, which is an objective for us in order to diversify the business."",
  ""So that's a nice progress."",
  ""And you can see a bit more detail about the breakdown of our funds by different strategy on the top right."",
  ""So, the flows for the 12-month period are shown in the usual Impax format on this slide."",
  ""So, the one that stands out, of course, is the one right in the middle, the top, which is the outflows, over £3 billion from BNP Paribas Asset Management."",
  ""These are really dominated by central gatekeeping decisions initially to allocate client money away from equities into money market and fixed income funds."",
  ""We have seen towards the end of our period and into the new financial year that those allocations out of equities and Impax managed funds have slowed."",
  ""So that situation is improving."",
  ""This is similar but smaller situation with St James's Place on the left-hand side."",
  ""That's one of our largest UK clients."",
  ""And then also flows from out of funds in the rest of Europe and North America."",
  ""But broadly speaking, the outflow situation has eased, albeit we did announce a few weeks ago that some of our St James's Place money, about 13% of the total assets, would be leaving in November, which is in addition to those outflows that's just less than £800 million."",
  ""So, that's part of the new financial year not shown here, but really very much a one-off."",
  ""And our relationship with St James's Place remains very strong."",
  ""So, talk to – now touch on the progress against Impax's strategic priorities, so starting with our listed equity plan, which is to grow organically."",
  ""So, here, we've been making investments into our team and improving the process and the structure incrementally."",
  ""We've got quite a large 40-plus investment team in listed equities around the world, so plenty of firepower."",
  ""And as the teams grow and then we've been making sure that everything is working optimally, we've also been launching some new products as shown here."",
  ""So, another thematic product, which we're calling Social Leaders, which is a tilt towards healthcare and financials, a US version of our very well established and successful Leaders strategy."",
  ""And two additional strategies, one expanding our Asian coverage to emerging markets and an EFA, i.e., non-US product for three US investors."",
  ""So, if you've heard our presentations before, you'll have heard over the last 15, 18 months or so that we've been investing further in our fixed income capabilities from a relatively small base of US management."",
  ""So, three things that we've been doing there."",
  ""Firstly, expanding our team, our research team, which has been largely in the US."",
  ""Secondly, appointing a very experienced section or division head, the first position to this post – the first person to this post, rather."",
  ""And thirdly, making a couple of acquisitions."",
  ""So, the first of those is now closed with assets under management of £0.3 billion included in this data, that's so-called Absalon Corporate Credit, global high yield and emerging market corporate debt based in Denmark."",
  ""And the second one is shown there, SKY Harbor, which is actually European assets of a US company called SKY Harbor, which is breaking into two parts."",
  ""We're buying half of it."",
  ""And that transaction we announced in the summer and that should close around the end of the calendar year and bringing in about £1.3 billion of additional assets."",
  ""So, those assets are not shown in our AUM here."",
  ""So, it will be in addition to £37.2 billion."",
  ""So, this investment team, you can see that has expanded from 14 and will be 20 by the time the SKY Harbor acquisition closes."",
  ""Private equity, we've also made good progress this financial year, so I think this is pretty self-explanatory."",
  ""But our third fund investing in renewable energy developers and construction opportunities has continued to make strong exits and is on course for further exits for the next 12-month period."",
  ""Our IV Fund had its final close in January this year, the largest fund to-date, and is now nicely invested."",
  ""And we are thinking about how to expand this area."",
  ""For example, a fifth fund, which we're not ready to announce yet, but that would be a logical follow on."",
  ""We're also open to other teams and possibly boutiques joining us in private market."",
  ""In the distribution area, I think we're very proud of the fact that we've now had a two-plus decades of global distribution with, as I mentioned, offices in Asia and the US."",
  ""We've made quite significant strides forward in the last 12 months, including opening office in Denmark, appointing representatives to cover Germany and with SKY Harbor, Switzerland, and then distribution partners in the south of Europe and Middle East and Latin America as well."",
  ""So, the number of awards there, I think, has continued to expand."",
  ""Examples of the ones we've won recently including a third King's – Queen's Award previously for enterprise."",
  ""And we've been winning awards in multiple countries."",
  ""And then the focus, of course, is on building a efficient and scalable model."",
  ""So, with more than 300 staff and over 90 individual funds and accounts we're running, then there's very much a need for top quality infrastructure risk and compliance functions, which we've had in place but have been further strengthened and expanded over the last 12 months."",
  ""And we're also paying very close attention to our culture and employee engagement."",
  ""So, employee engagement score from the annual survey was slightly down on the previous year but remains a top performer relative to the benchmark that our consultants use."",
  ""And we're also in the context of a slightly expanding head count."",
  ""So, making very good progress in career developments for women and ethnic minorities and just ensuring that we've got a fully diverse culture and community, which I think it benefits the intellectual process and the investment – the quality of the investment work as well."",
  ""So, just a couple of slides to finish."",
  ""So yes, I think since November 6, the world has been an uncertain place."",
  ""But if you look through the early announcements from the Trump administration and Mr. Trump himself, then I think the expectation with the central scenario is that the economic situation, particularly for US companies, will be positive over the next 12 plus months."",
  ""And it's quite likely that, if you like, the US industrials and innovative businesses, particularly in the mid-cap area, will do well in terms of earnings and investor sentiment should remain strong."",
  ""Fixed income markets also likely to be attractive."",
  ""So, provided asset allocation and security selection is good, which is I think two of our strengths, then there is no reason why our investment portfolios couldn't perform well in absolute terms."",
  ""And as we've been talking about, this mean reversion should lead to some relative outperformance as well."",
  ""We're not obviously guiding as to when that will happen, but it is long overdue given the de-rating that's been experienced."",
  ""It's also worth noting and just re-emphasizing the fact that Impax's approach is to look at quality companies focused on markets that are in transition as a result of technology change and consumer sentiment evolution."",
  ""And therefore, we're not an ESG investor or an impact investor."",
  ""We're not at risk of any of the sort of anti-work policies coming out of the Trump administration."",
  ""In fact, to the contrary, I think we are likely to benefit from an emphasizing of common sense and back to basics and avoiding confusing language."",
  ""So, in the context of Impax's strategy, then as you've heard, we are positioning the business for further development over the medium to long-term, and that means adding another suite of strong investment capabilities, adjusting and expanding our distribution and focusing very much on increasingly the financial leverage in the business as we scale revenues in the context of strong control of costs."",
  ""So, just finally, with the summary slide and then I'll hand back to Andy, so I think the positioning of the firm continues to be excellent in the context of specialized boutique asset managers who've got the scale having a very rosy future, provided they've got the right strategy."",
  ""We think that our investment philosophy does give us a route to alpha generation over the medium to long-term."",
  ""And we've got many years of experience now in operating efficiency and cost control."",
  ""So, we have had more than two years of really challenging markets, and it's time for some mean reversion."",
  ""So, we're looking forward to that and not, of course, clear exactly when it's going to happen."",
  ""But I think as with as political uncertainty drops away, then we are expecting a very positive 2025."",
  ""So,  for listening and back to Andy and hopefully some questions."",
  ""I hope you can hear me okay."",
  ""So, today, I'll take you through some of those numbers that Ian had mentioned at the start but try and get through quickly in that we're announcing today, hopefully, there should be no surprises in here, a set of very solid numbers against a well-established – in line with a well-established consensus."",
  ""And that was in a year, as Ian has said, challenging in terms of net flows, but one in which we've been able to drive the business forward along its strategic priorities."",
  ""So, looking there at the numbers, just to walk through the headlines that we have here, it was an adjusted operating profit of £52.7 million."",
  ""The PBT slightly above that and the adjusted earnings per share at £0.322."",
  ""Now, all three of those headline measures are lower than they had been in the previous year."",
  ""And the reason for that really was despite a flat AUM was that revenue has fallen by just under 5% from £178 million down to that £170 million."",
  ""We'll get into that in more detail."",
  ""But offsetting that was very strong focus on the efficiency and cost control across the listed equity business in particular that has seen costs reduced by £3 million."",
  ""And the net result of that is a solid margin, still remaining at 31%, above the 30% place that we like to be."",
  ""And then lastly, announcing a final dividend of £0.229, taking the full year dividend at £0.276, the same as last year."",
  ""Well covered and supported by strength in the balance sheet And on the next slide, we just look at revenue in a little more detail."",
  ""So, I could sort of put the headline summary that AUM stayed flat, but the average AUM year-on-year was sort of the – was less in this year and that was the reason for the shortfall."",
  ""But I've just put a bit more color around that because there are many moving parts of the revenue picture across that £37 billion, but I'll try and summarize it in three key points if I can."",
  ""So, the first one actually is looking at the impact of activity."",
  ""In the prior financial year that we carried into this year, that in total impacted our revenue by £8.7 million."",
  ""So, in some ways, in explaining a walk across actually that the activity of the FY 2024 actually was net neutral."",
  ""But the second key point when we look at the activity in FY 2024 was the much talked about net outflow that we had of £5 billion."",
  ""That did have a significant impact on revenue year-on-year, reducing that by £12 million."",
  ""But that was more than offset by the less talked about improvement that we had in the overall absolute performance of the Balkan end markets."",
  ""And on top of that, as Ian mentioned, that we had a record close on our net over fund and that resulted in a further benefit to the tune of £1.5 million in catch-up fees."",
  ""And then the overall movement of the margin has sort of picked things back a little there."",
  ""But I would then just to follow through on the margin and looking at the graph on the right-hand side is that whilst you can see that nearly a basis points drop in the average fee margin that is not raising any alarm or I don't want to cause any alarm with that."",
  ""Already, the run rate for the book at the end of September was climbing again up to 44.8 basis points."",
  ""And this is comfortably operating within the corridor of plus or minus 1 basis points around the 45 basis points."",
  ""And the guidance that I give this year, again, remains the same that we expect just the margin to drift slowly over down over time and that will include the fixed income over the short-term."",
  ""Earlier on the call and a key challenge of these calls and these moments in the year is to try and give guidance in terms of where we think the revenue picture for the business will go."",
  ""And that's just incredibly difficult just now in terms of whilst we're seeing an improving picture in net flow, there's still a lot of uncertainty."",
  ""So, I'm really looking at, I guess, you could say playing it safe to a degree, looking at the annualized run rate that we're coming out of the yearend with £166.5 million."",
  ""We're very hopeful to close the SKY Harbor deal over the course of the next number of weeks."",
  ""So, that would I see that as a neutral position."",
  ""It assumes that markets don't grow."",
  ""It assumes that flows are neutral."",
  ""And I guess that's sort of the starting position that the – the most sensible guidance that I can give, and that as the year unfolds and we see how flows and markets move that we will be adjusting that position up or down."",
  ""And a – but the one thing I will say is that the revenue base remains very, very well diversified, both through the list of 90 clients, over a number of – well, there are global distribution in place and then we have looking to add a fixed income which sort of gives that further diversification and further opportunity for the revenue base."",
  ""Looking then on the next slide, if I can, at costs."",
  ""So, overall, the costs for the year reduced by £2.9 million."",
  ""Again, looking at the chart at the top, there was a small cost increase of £1.5 million, largely into our fixed income business."",
  ""But underlying that, what we had was a significant effort on driving efficiencies into the listed equity business that we have built, and they are offsetting inflationary pressure that we have in the business."",
  ""So, we can prove that we can manage the costs of that listed equity business effectively."",
  ""And then you see the benefit – the small cost increase was offset by a benefit, a cost reduction, a variable staff cost, which is the bonus, and that is applying our policy, our long-standing policy of paying up to 45% of pre-bonus profits as the bonus pool."",
  ""And this year you can see in the second bullet that we've applied a percentage of 40% not far off the 40.5%, and that overall reduction comes from applying the 40% to a reduced pre-bonus pool."",
  ""Again, looking to the right-hand side, 70% of the cost base of this business is people related, so looking at head count is a very key feature for us."",
  ""You can see that 15 heads were added from 300 up to 315, of which 8 were into our fixed income business."",
  ""The rest, we're really just filling out vacancies."",
  ""And the last dataset there at the bottom, just drawing your attention to the £82 million."",
  ""That is the lion's share of our cost base."",
  ""But I also wanted to draw attention to the non-staff cost base increased by a very small percentage."",
  ""And that is – we are keeping a lid on cost growth in the business."",
  ""In terms of guidance that we see on that, we will continue to focus on our efficiency."",
  ""But again, I draw attention to run rate of about £118 million."",
  ""Added to that will be the cost base that will come alongside the acquisition of SKY Harbor."",
  ""I'm guiding that I expect the outcome for costs next year to be mid to low-120s."",
  ""And then bringing that together on the next slide, really just looking at the operational gearing that's in the business."",
  ""This overall shows the operating margin at that very pleasing 31%."",
  ""But for me, what I think is even more pleasing is this opportunity that we now have to really focus on the efficiency of the model that we've been building and the costs that we've added over the last number of years."",
  ""And what that's allowing us to do is actually to build an even more operational gearing into the business, adding confidence that with the expected return to attraction for active managers and flows to return that we expect to be moving towards that mid to high-30s as the operating gearing base, and that's certainly the goal that we're working to."",
  ""Moving on then to look at the balance sheet and just some more detail is the cash generation of the business was strong this year, £49 million."",
  ""That was up from about £37 million last year as we focused actually on cash and fee collections."",
  ""And then the uses of the cash, similar as we've seen in terms of the dividend that was paid last year and that would be at the same levels going into next year."",
  ""We continue to acquire our own shares, small seeding into some of the new strategies that Ian had mentioned, taking the overall sort of cash on the balance sheet to a very healthy £90.8 million."",
  ""With that strong cash generation, we have been able to maintain the dividend at £0.276 with a payout of 87%."",
  ""And I should remind you, at the half year, we announced an adjustment to our dividend policy that previously had been to pay out between 55% to 80%."",
  ""We, in fact, removed that top end cap of 80% to say that the policy will be in normal circumstances to pay out more – at least 55%."",
  ""And that enabled us to sort of manage through a cycle and be able to grow with – and maintain if not grow the dividend through a challenging earning period given the strength of the balance sheet."",
  ""And that's what you've seen us being able to do and announcing that dividend today."",
  ""To move on then to the balance sheet – further balance sheet is to say very little change here."",
  ""I'm pleased to say we maintained a strong capital surplus."",
  ""The balance sheet still remains in very strong position, and we have no debt in the business."",
  ""And also, to say that there is no change in our – how we're thinking about capital and our capital allocation priorities, which lead with maintaining a healthy capital buffer for the business."",
  ""We then look to – we will continue to buy share buybacks to offset So, before I just hand back to Ian, I can look back on a – actually, when you step back at these points in the year, it's been a challenging period now for active managers."",
  ""But I can look back over the last 12 months and feel that impacts were emerging in very good shape."",
  ""We've maintained the strength on the balance sheet."",
  ""We have built our listed equity business and we're now adding fixed income to that and being able to focus on the efficiency."",
  ""So, for me, what that's doing is building – we've built a model, puts us on a strong fitting where we can manage through, I think, a number of scenarios that we may face as we move into sort of the uncertainty over the short-term that we still see, but hopefully come through in very short order."",
  ""And then, it sets us up in the long-term, I would say, to be even better placed than I could have said this time last year in terms of being able to take advantage of the mean reversion and the return to positive flows for the business."",
  ""And with that, I will hand back to Ian.""

  "" both for a very clear presentation."",
  ""Let's go straight and maybe continue the Donald Trump theme and it's a question submitted earlier in the presentation where you were taking a positive stance."",
  ""I think you have expanded on that in the outlook that you just given."",
  ""And the question was going to be, is your optimism based on a more macro top-down view good for the American economy, good for American corporates, versus the fact that you have a number of investee companies that might be well-placed in sectors that would benefit such as infrastructure?"",
  ""I suppose the answer may well be a combination of those two."",
  ""You're showing form as usual, Andy, in you know what the answers are."",
  ""So, look, that's absolutely right."",
  ""I think we don't have any special insights as to – of course, as to what the top-down configuration will be of Trump era policy."",
  ""But common sense would suggest that President Trump in his second term will not act to erode the wealth of his core base."",
  ""And so, it's highly likely, in our view, that inflation will remain under control, the interest rates remain moderate and will drop, and therefore it's not really foreseeable in our central scenario that tariffs for trade will be punitive all over the place."",
  ""There might be some examples made of what could happen if other policies around the world don't negotiate in President Trump's direction."",
  ""But – and also, I think immigration needs to be carefully managed, otherwise labor cost could go up, which of course will bring in inflation."",
  ""So that's the top-down view."",
  ""And then the bottom-up stock selection view, of course, remains the usual challenge is what we get paid for and our teams are beavering away working out exactly what the optimal selection of securities and portfolio construction is."",
  ""And another bigger thing theme that's been a headwind for asset managers, active asset managers is, of course, the conditions shifting perhaps away from passive that's had a very strong run."",
  ""And the question we have is, is this part of the discussions that you have with current and prospective clients in that they might be seeing active management as a neglected opportunity or perhaps even seeing it as a risk reduction measure against the concentration of exposure in the market to the Magnificent Seven?"",
  ""So, I think that Magnificent Seven mega-cap tech phenomenon has caused major problems for active management over the last 18 to 24 months as those five to seven stocks have really torn away in share price terms."",
  ""And it's been very difficult for active managers to maintain market weightings or above market weightings of those stocks from a risk management perspective."",
  ""So, this is an extreme version of what we saw in 2007, just before the financial crash."",
  ""I think we're unlikely to have a similar financial crash for reasons that are well-rehearsed."",
  ""But at the same time, it's not really foreseeable that the mega-cap tech stocks will continue to expand their multiples without some kind of mean reversion on a relative basis."",
  ""So, that's what we've been referring to throughout this conversation."",
  ""Yes, clients are generally allocating to managers like Impax because they believe in our investment edge and investment thesis on the one hand, plus our skill in generating alpha within that thesis."",
  ""And so given that we're positioned largely in the institutional market, we do have lots of conversations with clients about how that's going, how our risk parameters are developing, and those clients are constantly examining what their – the weighting is of Impax versus other managers."",
  ""The net result of which is that we've got a really stable client base because the outflows that we've been experiencing have been overwhelmingly from the non-institutional, more sort of wholesale markets which are either driven by one or two gatekeepers allocating to money market funds, as I mentioned, or retail investors who are perhaps fearful of de-rating turning into long-term sort of structural weakness, which is definitely not the case."",
  ""And I do have some questions for Karen later on."",
  ""So, I hope she's not feeling neglected."",
  ""But this question does seem to have your name on it, Ian."",
  ""It's regarding fixed interest and the question is, how does the growing fixed interest offerings sit with Impax's founding investment thesis, which you must know a great deal about?"",
  ""Is this expansion and diversification driven by a need to meet the needs of your distribution partners, perhaps?"",
  ""Well, look, I think it's a sign of strength and progress in this idea of the transition to a more sustainable economy that the companies are operating within it, for example, the companies selling heat pumps or wind turbines or water purification equipment are now large enough and robust enough to be able to attract debt capital, which would then reduce their overall cost of capital."",
  ""So, the strength of our investment idea is leading naturally to more opportunities in fixed income."",
  ""So that's one probably the main reason why this is now emerging as an opportunity, and we've been building this since our Pax acquisition in 2018."",
  ""It does mean that to build a more – a fully diversified and properly sort of risk managed fixed income portfolio, we are investing in debt securities from perhaps a wider range of companies than, say, our thematic equity products."",
  ""So, that does include companies that are in more traditional sectors."",
  ""But those companies need to manage their risk around, say, climate exposure or technology disruption and the risk of stranded assets from new industries."",
  ""So, that risk analysis is a key part of the fixed income investment process."",
  ""And our clients are in that area, of course, cognizant of our edge and of our views of markets and are backing us to run fixed income money in a successful fashion, which very pleased to say we continue to do."",
  ""And interesting question here, you've expressed a preference to grow in fixed interest."",
  ""Does that mean you would decline an acquisition opportunity in the equity space at the same time you were considering an opportunity to build a fixed interest income exposure, even if the equity deal was particularly attractive in the context of your equities business?"",
  ""As you said, that is an interesting question."",
  ""So, the starting point, broadly speaking, is that we are not actively seeking acquisitions in listed equities for two reasons."",
  ""One is that we would expect that there would be significant overlap between investment products that are run by others on the one hand and our own investment products, so there would be some potential for client confusion."",
  ""And secondly, that any team that wants to join Impax would probably have skills that we already had."",
  ""So, if we were to bring in an equity manager or boutique, we would have to navigate some quite significant overlaps."",
  ""So, relatively speaking, fixed income is a much more attractive area because given our relatively small base, the probability of overlap is much lower."",
  ""Now, Karen, moving on from acquisitions, we have a question of what financial metrics do you consider when you are assessing a fair price to pay for an outside target?"",
  ""And whilst we have you here, a question here."",
  ""A viewer says  very much for your revenue bridge, and he apologizes for his no doubt stupidities."",
  ""But could you give a little more explanation about the Yeah, very clear."",
  ""A couple of questions on distribution, I suppose."",
  ""Given your strong proposition, why isn't Impax running mandates for some of the other multi-manager investment trusts of scale like Alliance, Wheaton or RIT Capital?"",
  ""Gosh, I don't know the specific answer to that."",
  ""I mean, frankly, we are knocking on the doors of all sorts of managers around the world."",
  ""I have to say that we are, I think, best known and have the strongest profile in consultant advised institutional markets."",
  ""So, whether it's the consultant rating on our strategies that appeals to pension funds in particular."",
  ""So that's probably the biggest and actually frankly the most scalable segments of our client base."",
  ""The UK All right, we shall pass that on."",
  ""Following on from St James's Place, let's have a look."",
  ""We have a question here."",
  ""Do you think there are any other material mandates in the UK that might be at risk of a similar outcome as that seen with a small part of the St James's Place portfolio because of UK consumer duty customer value issues?"",
  ""Well, just to back out then, the St James's Place business that we have – we had at the start of this new financial year, so 1st of October 2024, was into two mandates, a small one by 13% was in a multi-manager mandate."",
  ""And the much larger one, 87% was in the sustainable and responsible equity branded bucket."",
  ""So, the small one that we've lost and that was not due to consumer duty."",
  ""In fact, I think we're top of the class in terms of St James's Place's managers with regard to consumer duty."",
  ""But it was rather a decision by the managers at St James's Place to move to a slightly different risk profile in the equity managers."",
  ""So, that was a reason for that mandate going."",
  ""We generally don't have much overlap with consumer duty in the sense that our products in the UK, with the exception of our investment trust, are not really directly available or marketed to the general public."",
  ""So, they are generally intermediated by private wealth managers or other platforms or marketed to institutional investors."",
  ""So, in that sense, we don't see the consumer duty as a headwind in any way."",
  ""And in fact, as I said, the ranking from St James's Place in the context of consumer duty for Impax was very positive."",
  ""And a couple of questions on staffing, maybe for you, Karen."",
  ""You've clearly made as a group some good hires during the course of this year."",
  ""Has anybody at the senior management level left the firm?"",
  ""And then a separate but related question is in terms of the businesses that you have been or in the process of acquiring, do you typically retain all of the staff members that you take on?"",
  ""Well, let me take that and then you can add if there's anything else."",
  ""We haven't had any senior managers leave the firm."",
  ""In fact, we have a very low staff turnover."",
  ""And so, yes, I think that's just a key attribute for the company."",
  ""In terms of the acquisitions, then when we bought the Pax business in 2018, we picked up 8 – sorry, we picked up 50 staff and with I think 1 exception So, it's a particular strength of Impax that we've got a very successful and healthy culture, pay lots of attention to how we treat staff, career development, a strongly collegial culture and sort of fair and equitable way of distributing the financial compensation as well."",
  ""So, yeah, very optimistic about that in particular."",
  ""It's, again, slightly bigger picture and recognizing very much that Impax's Yes, probably."",
  ""There was an announcement about the $300 billion of climate finance towards the end or at the end of the conference."",
  ""But there was a real shortage of detail there."",
  ""So, I think, yes, we'd agree that the conference itself was underwhelming."",
  ""And even before the conference started, I think attention was refocusing on the COP30 conference, which will take place in Brazil around this time next year."",
  ""Having said that, though, we certainly don't believe that our investment opportunities are significantly influenced by the companies or the parties or COP process, and that's because they don't lead to policy changes that directly impact our businesses."",
  ""They're more sort of high level and longer term in context."",
  ""And meanwhile, the falling cost of technology and regulatory support around clean energy, for example, the UK's Clean Power by 2030 Plan are much more important in the assessment of investment opportunities."",
  ""Well, can I thank our audience for their attention and a wide range of questions, one or two of them that we haven't covered are relating to the value of Impax's business or Impax shares."",
  ""So, I would point out that in terms of that analysis and then forward-looking materials, there was a detailed note written by Equity Development today, which is well worth reading."",
  ""The audience will get feedback forms, which the company is always very keen to see filled out and hear what you think about the business and the presentation."",
  ""And, of course, last but not least, on a very busy day for the company,  very much to Ian and Karen for coming back and making the time to talk to investors."",
  ""We look forward to see you again, hopefully in six months' time and wish you good fortune until then."",
  "" for joining and  for hosting, Andy."",
  ""So, we have been busy, as you can see, over the year."",
  ""So, I think, we are using the fairly traditional multiples, et cetera, as sort of where we would start."",
  ""But there's also tests that – there's organizations But generally, if I can look at the specifics of the two deals that we have done, it really has been an element of driving out for the strategy but ensuring that we're growing that fixed income business by bringing revenue in at the same time as that we're adding cost into the base."",
  ""So, for us, it's about accretive acquisitions."",
  ""No, I think the biggest factor when you look back over – we say that the market and active management has been challenged in terms of outflow for the last three years."",
  ""I think for Impax that step down from inflow to net outflow happened in the second half of 2023."",
  ""So, what you're seeing is the annualization of it was six months impact in FY 2023 that then a further six months happened as we take that into 2024."",
  ""That's the science, if you like, behind that calculation."",
  ""Ian, do you want me to take that?""

  ""I couldn't have done the introduction better than you."",
  ""I'm really happy to present to you with Mathias last year numbers and give you an outlook on our strategy and what we expect for the New Year."",
  ""The agenda, it's very similar set up like all the presentations before."",
  ""A summary on the operational highlights, a strategy update and a view on our midterm ambitions."",
  ""Mathias will go into the details of the full year 2024 numbers, the trading and the outlook we will do together."",
  ""And then a short summary, I'm very happy to answer all the questions here or later through Nicola and the team."",
  ""We have seen a strong 2023-2024, not only because of the results achieved, but also the progress and the transformation."",
  ""And I think this is both important because we do the transformation on the basis of a strong business, strong revenue and a significant increase in EBIT in line with our guidance we have given to you before."",
  ""We have seen strong improvement of net debt, very important to us, something which is also important for the next seasons."",
  ""We have seen an outstanding NPS quality scores."",
  ""We very much believe happy customers come back and add a lot of value to TUI."",
  ""Therefore, there's a strong focus on quality."",
  ""We have achieved our ESG milestones, also very important, and not only the CO2 emission milestones, but also the social, the targets we have given to us."",
  ""And we do see a successful progression of our strategy on HEX Holiday Experiences, the asset right growth on Markets + Airline, the growth on dynamic, the transformation on platforms."",
  ""And I will go into details afterwards."",
  ""I always say TUI of today is different to TUI of yesterday and the TUI of tomorrow will be different to TUI of today."",
  ""We will further unlock significant value for all stakeholders, which is important for us."",
  ""We know that shareholders had to take a loss in the – during COVID and therefore it's very important that we look at all stakeholders."",
  ""We are growth-driven by operational excellence."",
  ""We have a lot of things we can do better by execution on the actions we have agreed and by further speeding up with our transformation."",
  ""Going into the details, €23 billion of revenues, EBIT €1.3 billion up 33% based on a robust customer demand."",
  ""We do see that HEX has grown products stronger with 33% Markets + Airline 28%."",
  ""We do see a positive momentum on winter 2024/2025."",
  ""What we keep in mind is that eastern this fiscal year, TUI fiscal year will be in April, not in March like in 2024."",
  ""Bookings are up in winter by 4%."",
  ""ASP is up 5% and summer bookings are up by 7%, ASP by 3%."",
  ""Holiday Experiences had a very solid and good start into the first half year."",
  ""We see strong demand and higher rates for unique and differentiated products."",
  ""So the unique and differentiated products give us the high margin."",
  ""And therefore, with having said that, we are able to give a guidance, we expect underlying EBIT to increase in the range of 7% to 10% by driving the agenda we will have presented."",
  ""And the midterm targets remains at also 7% to 10% for the medium future."",
  ""To also improve further our indefiniteness."",
  ""If we go into the details, we have seen a very strong improvement in When we look at quality, a record high NPS, CSAT significantly better and that's how it should be, their numbers when it comes to our own products."",
  ""Here we had outstanding CSAT and NPS significantly above average, what we can see and the unique products are driving this NPS and driving the special proposition that TUI has in the market."",
  ""If we look forward, leisure will be a growth segment, leisure travel globally more outside the European core markets, but also in Europe and of course globally."",
  ""And what we can reiterate is what McKinsey says, travel is the top priority also for the future of people, customers spend less on other areas, but are very linked to travel."",
  ""So that's why it will stay the fastest growing consumer area spend."",
  ""One additional information which is important for us."",
  ""You know that TUI is very strong on the wholesale package."",
  ""We have started to move in the dynamic package, the market share are still very different, so there is a lot of catch-up potential on the dynamic part."",
  ""And in a market environment where the dynamic market is growing significantly stronger than the wholesale market."",
  ""And a few words on one slide."",
  ""We do see us more and more as a global curated leisure marketplace, where we deliver growth through our own differentiated product and through direct connect to the suppliers."",
  ""The key Holiday Experiences is to have unique products – to have products which are mainly only sold through TUI if it comes to hotels when it comes On the Markets + Airline side, we are undergoing a significant transformation from local markets to a global marketplace with platforms for sourcing."",
  ""There we have made huge progress."",
  ""We are connecting more and more to property management systems."",
  ""On the hotel side, we are connecting more and more on the inventory of airlines to get better access to inventory and to get better buying conditions."",
  ""And of course, building more and more selling platforms for all the markets where we are in to drive cost but also to drive synergies to get quicker, more agile."",
  ""This only works if we have a strong leadership, if we have happy employees."",
  ""And we will show you some numbers later on that we really can build on the workforce we have."",
  ""And of course, operational excellence and performance is very important on quality, but also on a lot of other issues."",
  ""First of all, it's important to fix the quality."",
  ""There we are – can be the best of breed, but a lot of other areas where we can get better."",
  ""If we shape that down into different levels then it is important strategic priorities market transformation into one global curated leisure marketplace, not activities country by country, but as a global approach based on its central customer ecosystem."",
  ""So wherever we get the customer from a seat-only customer or a customer who books an excursion in Spain or who books a museum ticket in Berlin, or buys an expensive cruise or very differentiated hotel product, we bring them all into one ecosystem so that we can use the data to create the right product offerings to the customer."",
  ""Third, the differentiated products serving global demand is the uniqueness of TUI, the global platform rollout, not one system here and there, global platforms."",
  ""By the way, for me also global platform is a very, very strong TUI brand which we really globalize."",
  ""And now, wherever you go and you see a TUI Hotel, it's with a strong red TUI Smile."",
  ""Based on a great place to work, people, employees have fun, management who has fun, can change a lot to the positive."",
  ""And sustainability, as the six priority, is a source of good, and we do see that as an opportunity."",
  ""By doing – focusing on these items, we want to grow the company without growing the operational leverage to create significantly shareholder value and, of course, to create value for all stakeholders, including customers."",
  ""What does it mean in more specific examples?"",
  ""As said, the transformation will drive profits and cash generation."",
  ""Cash is a very – has been always a big focus and it is a big focus."",
  ""Starting left top, driving connectivity to fuel dynamic growth."",
  ""More and more hotels, we get access to direct connect."",
  ""Not through hotel bed banks, not through channel managers."",
  ""Through direct link to hotels."",
  ""A big, big improvement to have access to the whole inventory to all functionality."",
  ""But not only hotels, also to airline content."",
  ""I'm really happy and we are proud that two days ago, we were able to connect Ryanair in the UK to our systems."",
  ""We have done so in Germany two month ago."",
  ""Unfortunately, the scale of Ryanair in Germany is limited."",
  ""It's, by far, the number one airline in the UK and Ireland."",
  ""We have started two days ago to offer additionally products – flight connections with Ryanair."",
  ""The good thing is it's completely complementary because what we do see is it's into cities and it's from airports, which we don't serve on our own."",
  ""The two first days were really outstanding, Second thing, to grow the share of app sales and the cross-selling opportunities."",
  ""Yes, we are growing – have grown the app share significantly and this is a good message."",
  ""We still have a lot to do to get in the 50%, 60% range where we want to be to create a value."",
  ""So a lot of investment, a lot of improvements into our app business."",
  ""And, of course, by having now capturing the data from all the entry points, from all sales point of the customers, we are able to build on the lifetime value of the customer, not only by selling more to him the right product, but also to keeping the customer through retention."",
  ""This is supported by a new operating model and it just will be effective 1st of January 2025."",
  ""We have built a functional organizational structure built on global platforms."",
  ""The sales responsibility, of course, stays in the market."",
  ""The production is done more and more centrally."",
  ""So one platform to connect with all the hotels."",
  ""One platform on the And the last, but not least thing is to grow the commercial capabilities of our airline business."",
  ""We do see a lot of benefits by doing that, not giving up any synergies between the We have seen strong growth in dynamic package."",
  ""We are now between 10% and 20% in the main markets."",
  ""By the way, in the new markets, we go dynamic."",
  ""Latin America On the app share, it's 40% increase."",
  ""The other message is we were just 7.3%."",
  ""The better message is, during Black Friday in the UK, we achieved 20%."",
  ""And even better message is, there are still at least 30% to achieve."",
  ""And distribution cost and bidirectional sales are better if you have the customer in the app."",
  ""And why we are confident to use?"",
  ""So first, we know how the technical rollout plan of functionality is on the app and we know that up to 90% depending market by market, are using our app for service."",
  ""So they are used to it."",
  ""So, On the Holiday Experiences side, we want to grow and we are now at close to 450 hotels."",
  ""We want to accelerate the growth from time to time with ownership, mostly with management contract."",
  ""And by doing that, we want to accelerate."",
  ""The first step is 500."",
  ""These are our own branded hotels."",
  ""We have several thousand hotels, which are exclusive to us, which then gives us also a broad base."",
  ""On the Cruises side, we just had the Mein Schiff 7 launched in summer."",
  ""We will launch the Mein Schiff Relax in April next year."",
  ""And the year later, we will launch the Mein Schiff Flow."",
  ""And the business have developed very, very nicely."",
  ""And, therefore, we will go back to dividend payments which is important to TUI, as we had before COVID."",
  ""By the way, the same for the Hotel area."",
  ""On TUI Musement, of course, we want to grow profitability."",
  ""We want to grow the B2C business, we want to grow the app sale, and we want to grow the new customer base, because being in the destination, it's a good way to get customers which have not been TUI customers up to now."",
  ""With the platforms we have developed, we want to further grow outside the non-core market."",
  ""We have just announced – I mean, first, we went in Eastern Europe to Poland."",
  ""We are now the number one in Poland, more than 1 million customer."",
  ""And from Poland, we will go to the other – we went last year, sorry, this year, to the Czech Republic."",
  ""We want to double the amount of customers in the Czech Republic in 2025, and we will move into more markets next year and the years after in Eastern Europe."",
  ""These are very profitable markets."",
  ""We have started to move into Latin America with a package."",
  ""It's based on – and the package based on the TUI brand, and North America will follow in due course."",
  ""And on Asia, I was just there."",
  ""We have started to implement or to build the first – not to build physically, but to build the first TUI branded hotels."",
  ""Significant demand by Chinese people or by Malaysian people, by Thai customers."",
  ""So, the TUI product is very well received and it's always the starting point for globalization."",
  ""And why can we sell the product well in South America and Latin America?"",
  ""Because our hotel base is strong, the TUI brand is known, and same approach we have now done in the Far East."",
  ""This we can only do with engaged colleagues who live the TUI Spirit."",
  ""We have a great Employee Engagement Index on this year survey."",
  ""And it's important to train our people."",
  ""When we say we want to get app-centric, AI-centric, means that we have to take our people onboard, that they support that."",
  ""We have – and you should keep in mind that we have a lot people in the service area where it's maybe less relevant."",
  ""We have trained 30,000, so half of the TUI population in AI."",
  ""We have seen a lot of initiatives which we are implementing in the company."",
  ""So that is a very new spirit."",
  ""And on the other hand, we need new, good people."",
  ""We have to attract them."",
  ""And, therefore, we have invested a lot in employees and branding."",
  ""We've got a lot of rewards, awards there."",
  ""And it's great to see that we – that has changed in the last two years significantly that we don't have an issue anymore to get the right people into the TUI ecosystem."",
  ""So to train and to motivate very important own people who are there and to getting – and to adding the good – very good new people into the TUI world."",
  ""We are delivering on our sustainability agenda."",
  ""We had agreed to SBTi targets to 2030."",
  ""We are in a good process."",
  ""We have achieved this year targets."",
  ""We'd achieve next year targets."",
  ""We launched the first solar plants in Türkiye."",
  ""We have – we put a lot of efforts in saving energy, water consumptions, sometimes by small investments, by new products to offer the customer to say room cleaning is only necessary every two days, every three days."",
  ""On the airline side, we are really happy that TUI Netherlands were able to be the number one in the atmosphere airline index ranking, being the most cost CO2 efficiency airline."",
  ""They are pretty On TUI Cruises, we have all ships now equipped with shore power."",
  ""So whenever there is green shore power available, we can use it."",
  ""And ship is 40% of the time in the harbor."",
  ""So it is a big, big step forward."",
  ""The two new ships will be LNG ships so they can drive with eLNG."",
  ""And the Mein Schiff 7 which was just delivered as a methanol-ready, also this is a big progress."",
  ""And small examples here in Hannover, we have a big factory for a PV plant and we are really proud about the TUI Care Foundation with their worldwide projects in countries where we bring customers to support people who have not been on the sunny side of life, to help them to get their own living, to get their education, and to get a good future."",
  ""And this is also part of our DNA and very much supported by our employees."",
  ""So this is a summary from my side."",
  ""It's always important to have also the hard numbers, and Mathias, that's what you do."",
  "", Mathias for the look backwards."",
  ""Looking forward of the winter, and again, Easter is in April, now 62% of our program is sold."",
  ""That is in line with previous year."",
  ""If we look into summer, the first glance, and it's only sold 17%."",
  ""So we need to be careful."",
  ""Bookings are up 7%, a big increase in Germany, and prices are up 3%."",
  ""We have seen recently a strong momentum and we believe that this is a good picture for winter and for summer."",
  ""The volatility on our hedge position is very limited or the result of our hedge position is very limited, because we are well hedged and we are well hedged at good rates."",
  ""That was Markets + Airline."",
  ""If we look into Holiday Experiences, we also had a very good start on hotel."",
  ""Unfortunately, we have the one or the other renovation."",
  ""So the available bed nights shows a slightly lower number."",
  ""Occupancy is 7% up at this time of the year for the first half year, and the rates are again 6% up."",
  ""This is really an outstanding result."",
  ""On Cruise, we have seen the significant increase, capacity increase."",
  ""The daily rate is slightly above the year before, when we had the 11% increase."",
  ""Occupancy is still below on a very, very high level, low compared to last year."",
  ""This is mainly the impact on the Suez channel closure."",
  ""We had to do some rerouting and to sell some other cruises."",
  ""We filled ships, we always had during the last month, 99% to 104%."",
  ""So it's a great achievement."",
  ""And on Musement, we again expect a high-single digit growth with own experience, which is important for our profitability."",
  ""And this leaves us with the guidance, Mathias."",
  ""The belief in the CFO isn't quite often higher."",
  ""A short summary before we come to the question section."",
  ""We are committed to profitable growth, which comes from new products to existing customers and to new customers."",
  ""We are committed to grow the customer base out of the existing markets and also by new markets."",
  ""We use the unique products to attract customers and we will be very tough on the transformation to get all the benefits from a global curated leisure marketplace built on global platforms which we roll out."",
  ""A very warm welcome to TUI's 2024 Results Presentation."",
  ""My name is Nicola and I'm here with our CEO, Sebastian Ebel; and our CFO, Mathias Kiep."",
  ""We are pleased to present a strong set of numbers for the financial year and we are also pleased to say that we have achieved all our targets for this year."",
  ""Throughout the presentation, we will give an update on our strategic progress on trading as well as our expectations for the new financial year."",
  ""And as always, we will be available after the presentation for Q&A. And with that, I have the pleasure to hand over to Sebastian."",
  ""On the 2024 results, usual review of P&L, cash flow and balance sheet."",
  ""This time I would also like to take a step back on the results we achieved in all the segments to have a view on how has the financial profile changed versus 2019."",
  ""And then looking forward, as Sebastian said, we go into trading and outlook in the next section thereafter."",
  ""Now, three things that I think are really important and that I'm really pleased with on 2024 results."",
  ""One, our revenue increased in line with our guidance with 12%."",
  ""Our guests have never invested more into holidays with us than in 2024."",
  ""This is really great to see and shows the resilience of the product."",
  ""Our earnings growth was 33% on the €1,296 million constant currency, 35% in line with our expectations and fully in line with our guidance and communication throughout the year."",
  ""So our targets that we set 12 months ago, we achieved and I'm really pleased with that."",
  ""And then a very nice and very strong improvement of our financial profile as a result."",
  ""And our leverage and balance sheet improved from 1.2 to 0.8."",
  ""And that's a very good step towards this target of being strongly below 1 times."",
  ""And I think it's a good foundation as well for the discussions with the rating agencies in the coming months."",
  ""On that basis, performance EBIT, where does it come from?"",
  ""Sebastian just walked you through this."",
  ""It come from all segments."",
  ""We see the recovery in the cruise segment And now taking a step back, these operational results, how has the financial profile actually changed?"",
  ""And I think that's something which is really important."",
  ""So if you go through hotels, the performance very clearly strongly above The same you see on the cruise side and again, very strong performance, first time above 2019."",
  ""Secondly, the returns in the segment really, really strong."",
  ""And then the dividend stream in TUI Cruises – from TUI Cruises to us has been restarted, and we saw the first dividend earlier than expected as kind of a kickoff dividend of €20 million that was paid in our fourth quarter, and that's I think a key element towards our expectation that TUI Cruises can return towards dividend payments in line with the past in 2025."",
  ""And then last point to Markets + Airline."",
  ""If you look at their profile, I think, guests, the 20.3 million in line with the historic if you go to the details, UK ahead of 2019, Germany ahead of 2019, Poland strongly growing."",
  ""These are all the elements and the small gap is coming now – in particular from the restructuring of France, which has been very successful."",
  ""We're taking out not profitable pax."",
  ""So overall, same kind of and better pax numbers."",
  ""At the same time, dynamic packaging has doubled versus 2019."",
  ""Revenue increased by more than 25%."",
  ""Again, what we also see this year, strong focus of our guests to invest into holidays, have a good holidays, high priority in terms of consumer spend."",
  ""EBIT margin is starting to grow again towards to our target of around 3% midterm in this segment."",
  ""And then very importantly, our risk capacity in the airline has been reduced, so from 150 aircraft to something like 125 to 130, end of year 125."",
  ""And the quality of the fleet has increased, so 2.5 times more MAX aircraft."",
  ""And then at the same time, we managed to bring the leverage in the segment down."",
  ""So the capital that we need to generate these results were €0.5 billion."",
  ""So leasings have been substantially reduced."",
  ""And I think if you then take a step back on these three segments: hotel, strong value creation, cruises, strong performance, dividends start to be paid again from TUI Cruises."",
  ""And now if you look at Markets + Airline, strong improvement in financial profile because what we need to generate the result is a much better mix."",
  ""Now coming to the details of 2024 and the P&L, the €1,296 million you have just seen, all the rest of the P&L is in line with our expectations, adjustments in line with the quarter."",
  ""We said interest even a bit lower than anticipated, also driven by better interest income."",
  ""And the tax rate of 80% has been confirmed, all resulting in a €1 EPS and that compares with around €0.60 EPS in the year before."",
  ""If you adjust for the capital raises that we had in 2023, and on that basis, a higher growth in EPS, even higher than we have in underlying EBIT."",
  ""Looking ahead, adjustments, we expect that they grow to a corridor of €40 million to €60 million, reflecting the cost of transformation and reflecting what we think we need in order to get to a higher earnings level, in particular in Markets + Airline."",
  ""And then the interest corridor in line with this year and that's something, I would say, this is a very good result because on the cash side, we're now below €300 million and we expect that the next year, despite interest rates coming down and we will have less interest income and a lot of our interest is fixed going forward."",
  ""This corridor can be maintained."",
  ""I just talked about cash."",
  ""Interest, the rest of the cash flow statement, again, in line with our expectations and in line with the corridor that you saw during the course of the year."",
  ""Working capital around €200 million that's in line with our top line growth, other cash effects that's taking out cash."",
  ""Non-cash elements in the cash flow statements, they're sitting in EBIT."",
  ""Sebastian just mentioned the impact that we had from valuations which are non-cash and which sit in EBIT and we reversed that."",
  ""The same less spending on maintenance payouts because of having less volatility in the aircraft portfolio."",
  ""Then we take out the joint venture results because they are non-cash and add back the dividends."",
  ""Strong improvements, of course, if you look at the relative side in dividend payments, you see the recovery that all these segments have."",
  ""Also on the cash flow side, the business have and you also see how important it is that TUI Cruises then in 2025 returns to a normal payout."",
  ""Again, I expect this to be rather flat going forward."",
  ""And then the investment of €600 million, we expect a slight increase of this number going forward."",
  ""You may notice that the structure of our cash flow statement has changed."",
  ""We now also put lease and asset financing amortization as a separate line just next to investments."",
  ""I think that gives you even more transparency in terms of what these payments are."",
  ""And it's also important to note that of this payments, around 10% are for asset paybacks, asset financing."",
  ""So a different quality compared to what we have as scheduled lease amortization."",
  ""Just on the CapEx, because Boeing is playing a major role on this with the Boeing delivery schedule, So, if you look at our delivery schedule, if I may, and the session – the part on investments here, we expected to receive eight aircraft in our financial year 2024, eight new MAXs."",
  ""We have received five, three slipped into 2025."",
  ""We expect now a much flatter delivery stream compared to this very focused one that we had originally agreed, 2025/2026."",
  ""And that means that we will constantly have more PDPs on balance sheet than we expected, which translates into higher CapEx, because whenever we get the aircraft released, normally the PDPs put them into a lease, and then we can use the PDPs for the next aircraft that is to be delivered."",
  ""Now, aircraft financing, also to mention that, given the recovery of the financial profile and the strong progress that we've made, and if you look at our interest cost development, the benchmarks there, more and more flexible options are now available to us."",
  ""And that's something that we will approach in the coming months."",
  ""And look at what are different options compared to leasing that may have an impact on how this is recorded in the cash flow and in the P&L. But in the end, I think the message that we wanted to leave with you is, one, Boeing delivery has an impact on our numbers, at the same time, we have more options going forward, and I look forward to that."",
  ""Now, ending with the financial statement is, of course, the balance sheet."",
  ""So, you see the improvement year-on-year that's coming, one, from cash flow generation, and second, from more down-payments in the lease portfolio."",
  ""Then we renewed leases, just mentioned the Boeing portfolio."",
  ""Overall, I think that's a result which is even slightly better than what we expected during this summer."",
  ""And you see that result, as leverage comes down to 0.8 times, as I said in the beginning, that's a very nice and very important step towards our targets."",
  ""And on that basis, I would like to conclude on 2024, I think very strong revenue growth translating into a good earnings performance."",
  ""We still have lot to do."",
  ""At the same time, if you look at the financial profile, that's the right trajectory to grow the company going forward."",
  ""And growing the business, I think this is ahead of us."",
  ""And maybe before we go into what is ahead of us, a final word on capital allocation."",
  ""We've slightly updated that to give you – to reflect what has been achieved."",
  ""I think, again, for us, number one is to grow the business, make sure operationally, we're on the right level and we see a lot of opportunities."",
  ""I think, Sebastian, what you mentioned just shows this is a very attractive sector with a lot of opportunities."",
  ""Then balance sheet, good step, still more to come."",
  ""And we said last time when we were here 12 months ago, we want to clarify what could be capital allocation, capital return strategy for shareholders once we have done operational recovery, balance sheet, and then also the rating agencies have kind of upgraded us."",
  ""Now, the rating agency is still something to be discussed and to come."",
  ""Under that basis, I think we can be clearer on what is that capital allocation in terms of thinking on shareholders going forward in 12 months in December 2025."",
  ""But now what will be in 2025?"",
  ""I think that's what is directly ahead of us."",
  ""And Sebastian, how do you look at current bookings?"",
  "" Musement, Musement always grows when you see volumes coming from the markets into this business."",
  ""And given the growth that we see for both the winter and the summer, this will translate into further growth of Musement."",
  ""And then, secondly, Markets + Airline, all the initiatives, the good booking looking ahead."",
  ""So we expect also a growth which is moderate here."",
  ""I think at the same time we have some headwinds in terms of the SAF and ETS costs."",
  ""So that's something which this whole sector has and which is reflected in this growth."",
  ""And we clearly see that all the initiatives are starting to pay off."",
  ""So, all these initiatives, we are looking at that very pleased."",
  ""Now, important, as Sebastian said, we have Easter shifting towards our third quarter."",
  ""So this was an impact that we will see in our second quarter, and then impacting the full half year."",
  ""In terms of further assumptions, I just mentioned them."",
  ""So, adjustments will increase in line what we think we need in order to support the transformation in Markets + Airline."",
  ""Interest more or less stable compared to this year."",
  ""Net investments slightly up, we just mentioned all the details on Boeing, lease and asset financing, And with that, I think, Sebastian, for you and summary and final words  so much, Sebastian, Mathias."",
  ""Operator, we are now available for Q&A.""
]","[
  ""First one is really about the sort of cadence of profit in the year, because you mentioned a few things, investment in the first half ahead of the summer, the Easter shift, and those maintenance reserves which hit Q4, which I guess reversed in Q4 this year."",
  ""So it'd be great if you could please quantify each of those items?"",
  ""And then, secondly, the guidance of P&L, interest cost of around €400 million."",
  ""I mean, it's not much lower year-on-year."",
  ""I'm just wondering what you think a sort of normalized medium-term run rate would be, assuming you get the credit rating upgrade, and obviously rates are coming down a bit?"",
  ""And then finally, just on current trading."",
  ""Germany is much stronger than the UK, that's just the market share gains post FTI, and on the UK, down 3% for the summer."",
  ""Should we read too much into that?"",
  ""It does look a bit weak."",
  ""Just on the first question, the maintenance reserve hit, could you quantify that?"",
  ""And is that going to normalize this year, please?"",
  ""Well, it would just be nice to quantify the hit, actually, if nothing else."",
  ""Maybe two questions from my side."",
  ""I noticed the optimism on UK bookings on dynamic packaging, but if I compare the release today versus September, if I calculate well, October and November, it looks to me that there wasn't much growth in bookings year-over-year."",
  ""Maybe they were a bit declining year-over-year."",
  ""So just if you can elaborate a little bit why that was the case."",
  ""And maybe the second one, looking at the free cash flow building blocks in 2025."",
  ""Can I run with you?"",
  ""We're starting from €230 million of free cash flow this year."",
  ""You're guiding for €100 million higher EBIT."",
  ""You're guiding for a steep revenue increase or potentially a couple of hundred million higher working capital."",
  ""You're talking about TUI Cruises JV dividends increasing close to pre-COVID levels."",
  ""That could be another €100 million, €150 million."",
  ""You no longer have the €70 million investment in the new JV, the equity injection you had this year in the new hotel JV."",
  ""So when I do this math, I'm getting to a free cash flow of €500 million to €600 million next year."",
  ""Am I missing any important building blocks from here?"",
  ""I cannot fully reconcile this with your comment that your net debt would just moderately improve next year."",
  ""And sorry, if you allow me one follow-up on the cost side."",
  ""I guess, you mentioned the maintenance charge that was a meaningful headwind in Q4."",
  ""But could you help us a bit understand going forwards what is the increase in the cost base in the Markets + Airline?"",
  ""We have this National Insurance in the UK."",
  ""You talk about the investments."",
  ""Could you help us a bit quantify the base of growth and cost there?"",
  ""So just if you could be more specific on Markets + Airline EBIT improvements in 2025?"",
  ""Can you And then more, a longer term, still in Markets + Airline, can you guide us on when we should think of significant improvements in EBIT for the Western Region?"",
  ""And lastly, can you – you just talked about growing the share of international in Markets + Airline."",
  ""Can you remind us what is currently the share of international within the division and how much will it grow, let's say, in four, five years' time?"",
  ""The first one is a typical CFO question."",
  "" I would assume that Jamie wants to know if the dollar course and the interest rate would be the same, what the hit has been in the fourth quarter, right?"",
  ""On the trading, I would not too much interpret into the actual numbers."",
  ""We are confident that we can achieve the targets."",
  ""The German number is probably a little bit overstated because of the small numbers we have booked."",
  ""We do see a potential for the UK market."",
  ""So, we are confident that we will see a nice set of numbers for winter and summer."",
  ""I think it clearly supports the message, we transform the business, and it's so important that we deliver on the transformation."",
  ""And we have seen positive impacts last year, and we will see a significant further – better positive impacts And knowing what we are delivering, we are confident that we can deliver what we just have announced."",
  ""I mean, when we said last time, at least 2025, we're able to deliver more."",
  ""Very difficult to know what the market environment will be."",
  ""For us, it's important that we deliver the benefits for us, and then we will see where we stand end of January when we have seen the turn of year bookings."",
  ""But there is a strong focus on transformation."",
  ""And last point, like we did on the Hotels side, it's so important to also grow outside the European core markets to get a improved winter profile, cash profile, to get a even safer volume stream into our own assets to benefit from the growth in other destinations."",
  ""So it's a program which includes a lot of different measures and benefits out of these measures."",
  ""Yes, with the Western region, had seen a quite significant amount of onetime effects, we assume a significant improvement there and it's not on France."",
  ""As Mathias said, it's been Belgium and the Netherlands."",
  ""And the share of international."",
  ""First I would little bit differentiate between existing European markets and new European markets."",
  ""As said, we are growing in Czech and other Eastern European markets."",
  ""We are growing in southern European markets."",
  ""And we have started to grow with markets, not with airline."",
  ""The airline will stay in the markets where they are."",
  ""We are also growing in Latin America."",
  ""Where will be the share in five years?"",
  ""I think it would not be solid to give you an indication today, we have ambitious plans, but let's see execute first and then we should talk about it."",
  ""And that we can do that, you may see the hotel business we started 20 years ago in the Caribbean."",
  ""We started five years or 10 years in So closing remarks."",
  ""We had a good last year."",
  ""We are confident about the New Year."",
  ""We have a very clear strategy on Holiday Experiences."",
  ""It's more the regular growth."",
  ""Of course, a lot of things get better there as well."",
  ""And on Markets + Airline, it's about the transformation to deliver the transformation but not only in the core markets but also to grow the business outside today's core market."",
  ""Again, to get more products to existing customer through the app and to get more customers in existing market, but also in new European markets or in other outside European markets."",
  ""And maybe you get back from the numbers."",
  ""But to celebrate a little bit...."",
  ""Just on the question in terms of how is the quarterly development, how do we expect that?"",
  ""I think the Easter shift, if you look at the business, that's easily something around €30 million to €40 million."",
  ""That's something we always saw in the past."",
  ""And given that the business has grown since we saw these effects and we had exactly that Easter full in the third quarter, it's an effect that's getting also bigger compared to the past."",
  ""In terms of first quarter, indeed we see the investments that we need."",
  ""So, we expect, in general, that's probably fair to say that most of the 7% to 10% will then be delivered in the second half of our fiscal year."",
  ""On the interest, I think there's €300 million cash plus and the non-cash interest on top."",
  ""That's something I would expect to be relatively flat for the coming years."",
  ""I mean, interest rates are coming down."",
  ""We have profited a lot from interest income."",
  ""At the same time, this will help us on the interest costs side."",
  ""But at the same time, we've just done quite a refinancing which is at fixed interest rates."",
  ""And then secondly, a big portion of our interest costs sits in the lease and asset financing portfolio, which only will then have an impact of this lower cost environment, and our, if we get it, potential rating upgrade in the mid-term."",
  ""And then I think the trading question to Sebastian."",
  ""I think this is very much dependent or Sebastian also said to interest and dollar development."",
  ""So sometimes you have a positive, sometimes you have a negative impact."",
  ""I think it's fair that the impact in Q4 was particularly strong and negative this year."",
  ""At the same time, it's then, of course, difficult to predict how this will reverse or change in the future."",
  ""I think it's a double digit, but not triple digit and it's not in the high-double digits."",
  ""Should I start on cash flow... ...and then maybe Sebastian on the trading?"",
  ""I think if you look at the earnings growth, one part will come from the 100% business."",
  ""Of course, this also includes cruises."",
  ""It will include Riu and the joint ventures."",
  ""So a part of this, as always, is growth and value and will not automatically be dividends that come to us."",
  ""Also, the dividends, something from the joint ventures you see also this year, there is a time gap because you always get this one year later."",
  ""Second, in terms of cruise dividend, indeed."",
  ""So this we expect to increase back to the historic levels."",
  ""Investments, you mentioned Riu, the Riu funding was included in the €600 million of this year."",
  ""At the same time, we increased our guidance for next year to this corridor, which is an average of €650 million."",
  ""Working capital, indeed, when we grow the business, we should see a return also on our working capital."",
  ""And then the second other important position is the amortization on the leases, which we expect to be broadly stable."",
  ""Now, in terms of the other cash effects, as I mentioned, this is also subject to how much changes do you have in the aircraft portfolio, whenever you have an old aircraft and you need to pay for the maintenance on those."",
  ""So that can be a bit more volatile."",
  ""But other than that, I think these are the major effects."",
  ""The inflation is coming down."",
  ""Of course, these elements are not particularly helpful."",
  ""I think, this year, we can manage with the changes in the UK pay system."",
  ""At the same time, when we mentioned that we transform the business, this also means there's a lot of focus on cost."",
  ""So, I would say, generally, we had some headwinds already this year in terms of how much you can grow sales versus how much you can – you have your cost increases."",
  ""I think this is coming down to a more stable corridor, but it remains something to work on."",
  ""Do you want to start with the Western region maybe?"",
  ""And just on the first question .""

  "", Demi, and  everyone for joining us today."",
  ""The third quarter was the most decisive period in Rivalry's history."",
  ""It was marked by a complete product overhaul, a major organizational realignment, and a substantial reduction in operating expenses."",
  ""This work was done to better tune ourselves to an evolving online gambling market, where cryptocurrency has become the global payment method of choice, and to align offering with the experiential expectations of the players driving this industry-wide shift."",
  ""These initiatives were set in motion during the second quarter alongside the announcement of Rivalry Token, now called NUTZ."",
  ""And I'm proud to say we are now merging out the other side of this immense undertaking as a leaner company and one better positioned for growth."",
  ""To touch briefly on the product overhaul completed just this week, it is in order of the magnitude the largest in Rivalry's history."",
  ""It was completed on an absolute breakneck pace, and included a revamped registration flow, login, sportsbook, new crypto-first cashier, completely redesigned casino offering and a comprehensive VIP rewards program."",
  ""This is effectively the entire product rebuild where 99% of interactions occur."",
  ""It was all done in about 90 days."",
  ""I would not do the team justice by describing how tirelessly they worked day and night, seven days a week to make this happen."",
  ""So, I'll just say  and that this is what it takes to win and that is our objective."",
  ""I will detail these new releases later, but we're confident this evolved product set, debuted alongside a more mature digital-first rebrand, will accelerate Rivalry's position as a global crypto-native operator and enable us to capture high value players."",
  ""And we already have some immediate internal data to share on this."",
  ""In just the two short months as we began to deploy the initial set of these efforts, meaning the start of October – from the start of October, so about 30 days into the 90-day sprint, our average net revenue per user has hit all-time records, increasing by 51% as compared to the 2024 year-to-date average up until that point and by 70% as compared to the trailing three-year average."",
  ""Additionally, our native crypto token has developed materially alongside these efforts."",
  ""It is integrated with our VIP strategy and overall growth plan, allowing us to better scale the crypto gambling category."",
  ""To touch on the organizational impacts during the quarter, we reduced our head count by approximately 50% through two workforce rationalizations, one that occurred at the start of Q3 and one in the final days."",
  ""On the back of this, we significantly adjusted our performance culture, resulting in a more robust and higher output organization with measurable output climbing over 200%."",
  ""It is this culture shift that made this product overall in record time a reality."",
  ""And I want to again thank the team for not just their resilience through this period, but also their determination to deliver at a level that far exceeds historic standards at Rivalry."",
  ""With the associated cost savings from this organizational realignment and a significantly drawn-down marketing spend associated with our prior strategy, both now near fully realized, I'm pleased to say that Rivalry's current run rate operating expenses are approximately 50% lower as compared to those in today's Q3 2024 report."",
  ""Additionally, Rivalry's Chief Technology Officer, Ryan White; and Chief Operating Officer, Kevin Wimer, have taken a voluntary 100% reduction in their salaries as of August and September, respectively."",
  ""I have also opted to reduce my salary by 100% as of October, and thereby, 50% as of November."",
  ""It's important that the leadership team share in the sacrifices we've asked of our team and shareholders in the near term as we complete this top to bottom realignment and strategy shift, which we can now build off of."",
  ""We're confident that our current run rate reflects a leaner, more efficient cost base, positioning us well Alongside today's third quarter results, we shared Rivalry's native crypto token has continued to deliver positive results, generating CAD 3 million in deferred revenue in Q3."",
  ""As noted on the Q2 conference call, token sales record as deferred revenue until we officially launch the token and deliver it to the wallets of those who pre-purchased them."",
  ""The anticipated date for this is early 2025."",
  ""In the meantime, we expect token sales to continue throughout the remainder of the fourth quarter and into the first quarter next year."",
  ""The revenue driven by our token during this period signaled that this product is finding market fit among our target audience and being well-received in the broader crypto community."",
  ""Beyond the direct revenue contribution, we're seeing encouraging downstream effects among customers engaging with the token, including revenue profiles that are on average 200% higher and retention rates that are 30% above average amongst crypto wallet connected users on Rivalry relative to our fiat customers."",
  ""Lastly, we successfully closed the second tranche of the non-brokered private placement announced earlier this week, totaling CAD 3 million raised."",
  ""It has been gratifying to get the support of insiders, family and friends, and long-term shareholders as we press ahead in this new chapter of the company."",
  ""This financing strengthens our balance sheet, underscores inside our long-term investor confidence, and supports our trajectory to profitability while enabling us to resume an offensive growth strategy."",
  ""Before going any further, I will ask Demi to review our Q3 2024 financial results in greater detail."",
  ""Now Demi, over to you."",
  ""Last quarter, I spoke to Rivalry's top priorities, and that's where I'll start today."",
  ""The first is developing our VIP customer base; the second, capturing crypto gambling market share; and the third, profitability, which will be an output of successfully executing the first two initiatives."",
  ""As detailed in this morning's press release and at the start of this call, we finalized the most substantial product overhaul in Rivalry's history."",
  ""This effort, spanning product, brand, payment, CRM and marketing, was intentionally designed to serve these core priorities and position us for scalable growth."",
  ""To walk through these developments in more detail, first, we've launched a revamped sportsbook product with 40 new titles, improved features and a streamlined interface."",
  ""Leveraging highly customizable white-label technology, we both massively improved our offering, preserved Rivalry's unique entertaining feel, while also significantly reducing internal development resources required to maintain this vertical."",
  ""This enabled us to better manage engineering costs and direct resources toward other high ROI areas of the business."",
  ""On to our casino, our product has been completely revamped to improve functionality and accommodate an expanding catalog of content."",
  ""We also debuted Casino Races, an interactive way for players to compete against one another and earn rewards based on their wagering activity."",
  ""This has been driving more action from our largest players in just a few short weeks since its release."",
  ""Casino has been a consistent and stable revenue source, with rising share and early data showing it accounted for two-thirds of betting handle among crypto-native players."",
  ""Casino will continue to play a vital role in our long-term strategy."",
  ""Building on our wallet improvements earlier this year, we've integrated a crypto-first cashier system."",
  ""This provides faster and more flexible deposit and withdrawal options across multiple digital currencies and strengthens our appeal amongst crypto-native players globally."",
  ""Players can now wager with digital currencies and import offerings that deepens the experience for users."",
  ""To strengthen player retention and drive activity among high value users, we've launched an expansive VIP program, offering cashback, free spins, monthly, weekly and daily rewards."",
  ""This asymmetrically rewards larger play so Rivalry's most loyal players have more reasons to play every day, driving wallet share amongst high value players."",
  ""We will be iterating this program at an extremely rapid pace, tweaking and tuning based on observed player interaction and directed dialogue with these players."",
  ""This customer-centric and highly innovative way of building is central to our DNA and will be an important contributor to sustaining our growing net revenue per player levels."",
  ""At the same time, we've also made significant enhancements to our customer relationship management flows or CRM."",
  ""These improvements are already helping us convert new users more effectively and reactivate churned players."",
  ""Next, our registration and login journey has been streamlined to reduce friction and expedite user onboarding while remaining compliant."",
  ""We've also begun rolling out a strategic rebrand across our product and marketing channels to better target crypto gamblers and digital-native players."",
  ""Brand has played a key role in Rivalry's competitive differentiation, and we feel confident this new direction will resonate with both our existing users, as well as the crypto audience."",
  ""Lastly, I'd like to discuss our project – our crypto project, Rivalry Token, now rebranded as NUTZ."",
  ""NUTZ supports our expansion into the crypto segment, engages high value players and creates a new revenue stream for Rivalry."",
  ""Once fully launched, which is anticipated in early 2025, NUTZ will function like any other cryptocurrency, deposited into users' digital wallets, priced by the market, and useful both on and off Rivalry's platform."",
  ""Importantly, NUTZ addresses a fundamental challenge in online gambling, the traditional win/lose dynamic between players and the host."",
  ""The token acts as a technological solution to create alignment between players and the host, embedding the challenges that the experience is primarily a win/lose cycle: deposit, wager, win some, lose some and repeat."",
  ""In online gambling, customers' losses are the operators' revenue, and that creates a relationship between the operator and the user that is atypical in consumer products."",
  ""This explains the loyalty challenge in online gambling and why many players will have accounts on multiple platforms at the same time."",
  ""Creating alignment between player and host to find a win-win approach is a sizable opportunity here, and that's what we aspire to solve with NUTZ or certainly move the needle on."",
  ""This problem set in online gambling and solving it is one we've been thinking about deeply since founding the company and solution that looked and sounded in many ways like NUTZ were ones that we had ideated and proposed back in 2017 when we originally were pulling together a license application in the Isle of Man."",
  ""It was too early then, with the technology not developed enough, nor legal frameworks in place."",
  ""So, it's incredibly exciting to be able to build upon our early philosophy and now execute it with this token project."",
  ""All to say, this is not an overnight concept for us."",
  ""For the last six months, customers have been earning NUTZ through on-site activities like sports betting and casino."",
  ""Tokens are earned on every wager, win or lose, and customers can amplify their earnings through daily missions and campaigns we're running that are designed to encourage engagement."",
  ""Once fully launched, these tokens can be used to bet on Rivalry, claim rewards and much more."",
  ""As a cornerstone of our VIP strategy, NUTZ enables us to deliver more customer-centric experience, foster loyalty and deepen site engagement."",
  ""Looking ahead, we will continue to enhance the token's utility, launch new products to attract more users, and drive connected wallets and additional revenue."",
  ""Our speakers on today's call will be myself and Steven Salz, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Rivalry Corp. Before we begin, I would like to remind listeners that certain statements made during this conference call presentation may constitute forward-looking information and forward-looking statements within the meaning of applicable securities laws."",
  ""These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of Rivalry Corp. and its subsidiary entities or the industry in which it operates to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward- looking statements."",
  ""When used in this conference call presentation, such statements use words such as may, will, expect, believe, plan and other similar terminology."",
  ""These statements reflect management's current expectations regarding future events and operating performance and speak only as of the date of this presentation."",
  ""These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, including those risk factors identified in the company's MD&A dated November 29, 2024, under the heading Risk Factors, that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements."",
  ""The company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required under securities legislation."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to Steven Salz."",
  ""Betting handle was CAD 79.9 million in the third quarter, representing a 9% sequential decrease from quarter two of 2024."",
  ""As Steven communicated, the significant drawdown in marketing expense associated with our previous strategy throughout the third quarter added direct impact on betting handle as we worked to reposition the business."",
  ""Additionally, a portion of the recorded marketing spend in the quarter represented agreement exit costs and was not put toward player acquisition."",
  ""Adjusted revenue in quarter three of 2024, inclusive of CAD 3 million in deferred revenue for NUTZ, was CAD 6 million."",
  ""Net revenue was CAD 3 million in quarter three of 2024."",
  ""The nine months ended net revenue was CAD 12.1 million, down 8% from the comparable period in 2023."",
  ""This is again primarily a result of the reduction in marketing spend and an increasing mix of casino betting handle, which, although more stable, is lower margin than sportsbook."",
  ""Looking at our two segments, gaming generated 62% of handle, with sportsbook accounting for 38%."",
  ""Gaming handle has continued to trend up compared to 60% last quarter and 51% in quarter three of 2023."",
  ""And as a percentage of net revenue in the third quarter, casino accounted for 40%, up 14% and 2% year-over-year, respectively, while sportsbook represented the difference."",
  ""Rising casino share is attributed to new content, exclusive games and continued product development."",
  ""I will now turn to operating expenses."",
  ""Total operating expenses decreased by CAD 0.7 million or 8% compared to quarter three of 2023."",
  ""However, as Steven noted in his opening remarks, with a meaningful portion of our operational adjustments executed throughout quarter three nearly fully realized, the run rate operating expenses of the company as of the date of this release are approximately 50% lower than what was reported in this quarter."",
  ""Marketing, advertising and promotion expenses decreased by CAD 0.9 million or 30% from the previous year."",
  ""Net loss of CAD 5.8 million represented a small increase of CAD 0.2 million from quarter three of 2023."",
  ""Lastly, I will briefly touch on our financial resources."",
  ""We ended quarter three of 2024 with CAD 2.1 million of cash."",
  ""Subsequent to quarter-end, Rivalry closed a non-brokered private placement for gross proceeds of CAD 3 million, which further supports our balance sheet."",
  ""With our current cash position, the aforementioned material reduction in operating expenses and overall cost structure adjustments, we are confident in our liquidity position."",
  ""I will now turn the call back to Steven.""
]","[
  "" for the update and good work on – plenty of things going on, good work on a lot of the corporate overhaul and the rebrand."",
  ""And congrats on the recent capital raise as well."",
  ""So Steven, with all these moving parts going on, I know you've kind of walked away from the guidance for now, but do you have a sense of just – can you just touch on the kind of your cash runway and as well as the current CapEx levels, which you've reduced significantly?"",
  ""How much runway do you guys think you have right now, and is there a chance you reestablish a profitability guide in next year once you kind of – the dust kind of settles?"",
  ""I appreciate the color there."",
  ""It's good to see – I think you actually had kind of an acceleration, if you call it that, from deferred revenue kind of run rate coming in, the CAD 3 million."",
  ""I think last quarter, you were talking about CAD 1.7 million in the first two months to CAD 1.3 million in the third month, which is great to see."",
  ""Is – when you touch on the users that you were talking about, 50% were reactivated users and I think 15% or so were new to Rivalry users, I think it was last quarter, do you have an update on that kind of stat more recently and kind of, I guess, in the second half of this year?"",
  ""Has that kind of changed or just curious about the user base and customer activations?"",
  ""And then, maybe just kind of touch on – just kind of last question, just on the handle trends, sportsbook, gaming."",
  ""Gaming has stabilized, it looks like."",
  ""Sportsbook is also somewhat stabilizing, it looks like, as well."",
  ""Do you have an idea of just – can you just touch on those two handle dynamics and where you see them kind of trending, and is – the third quarter seasonality-wise, just all these elements just to help give investors an idea of where it's going?"",
  ""I think that's it for me."",
  ""I think like if you look at the PR, our language there is kind of the way we feel about it, whereas you can imagine, looking at this release, it's like a 3,000-word release."",
  ""We've done a lot in the last three to four months and significantly, yeah, overhauled effectively every element of the company."",
  ""So I think in my quote in that release, we – I've noted So yeah, I think that the work we've done on operating expenses, the financing, which helps to bolster the balance sheet a little bit, and again, you just piece together the OpEx changes, the overall revenue picture that we have right now, and yeah, it doesn't take much to work back to the company generating cash flow."",
  ""So yeah, I think we feel comfortable with our liquidity position."",
  ""We feel comfortable with our ability to get there with where we're sitting today."",
  ""And then, with kind of the various catalysts coming up related to token, additional revenue that comes in there, potentially releasing that early next year, these are all things that support our ability to cross that threshold, which is still like our number one priority right now."",
  ""I mean, like not – yeah, not that specific one."",
  ""I think we're seeing pretty significant uptake of people So yeah, I think that to us is the best signal right now that the things we're doing are leading us in the direction that we wanted to, where if – having average net revenue, I'm sure you've covered lots of companies, like having an ARPU increase by like 50% hit historical levels is a pretty big achievement, and then the same thing when you compare it to a trailing three-year basis."",
  ""So, I think this is more where we're trying to push the dialogue because that's really what counts, like our ability to prove that we are engaging VIP players better, which just means people that are depositing more and play more."",
  ""Our ability to build product that is centered around high value players, specific like a crypto-native audience, like that will manifest to represent itself in like the aggregate, call it, ARPU of the company going up."",
  ""So yeah, we've seen like our internal kind of BI system."",
  ""It's like a hockey stick-looking chart basically, right, so to a degree we've never had in our history by far, and obviously, hence, kind of hitting these historical levels on those figures."",
  ""So, what that means is like we need far few players to generate the revenue that we're looking for, and then obviously, when you combine that with a operating expense base that is down significantly, this is just going to create way more leverage and torque for us."",
  ""We need way fewer players because we're generating way more revenue per player now, and we're seeing that continue to go up."",
  ""And then the overall, call it, OpEx base that needs to be crossed to deliver profitability is half of what it was even in the third quarter, let alone if you compare it to, let's say, Q1 this year or sometime last year, it's probably down 60%, 65%, right?"",
  ""So, these things are all playing to our advantage right now and we're seeing exactly like the KPIs that we would want to see from the strategy shift that we started four, five, six months ago."",
  ""No, we – yeah, we – both will grow."",
  ""That's kind of what we're moving back to now, now that we've completely reset the entire foundation of the company basically in the last four months."",
  ""But as a percentage of the total, our expectation is casino will continue to grow as a percentage of the total."",
  ""I think what we've seen, and we put that in the script a little bit, is crypto depositing players are – have a much higher propensity to be casino player than sports betters currently."",
  ""This is kind of a trend we see elsewhere, to be honest."",
  ""Like it's not just Rivalry."",
  ""If you look at other operators, it would be similar."",
  ""So, I think we obviously want the entire – the total pie to grow, fully anticipate it will, and then as a percentage of that overall pie, our expectation is, seasonality or not, is that casino will continue to be a majority share and probably like a rising majority share."",
  ""That trend, which is what we've been seeing in the last, let's say, two to three quarters, is like what we expect we'll continue to see going forward right now."",
  "", operator, and , everyone for joining us for the third quarter call."",
  ""And as always, you can shoot us an e-mail and happy to continue the discussion offline.""

  "" so much Sebastian and also a very, very warm welcome to all of you."",
  ""Not only in the net, but especially here in Berlin."",
  ""Actually, we are looking very forward to welcoming you then at the site."",
  ""I think it will be quite interesting insights for you."",
  ""It's one of our most modern production sites here globally."",
  ""And we have also Frank Seitzinger, who is the Business Sector Head, with us, so there will be also an opportunity for you maybe during the lunchbreak to have already a first chat and to understand what are the current opportunities when it comes to the cataract workflow and the activities there."",
  ""Welcome to the Fiscal Year 2023/2024 Analyst Conference of Carl Zeiss Meditech AG."",
  ""Let's have a brief look, as usual, at our agenda."",
  ""First, I will begin with an overview of the group results."",
  ""Then, Justus will provide more insights into the financials."",
  ""Following that, we would like to share some key highlights of the fiscal year with you, including updates on new products, key topics around China, and also especially our resilience measures."",
  ""Finally, I will update you on the outlook for the fiscal year 2024/2025."",
  ""And as usual, following this, there will be then a rich Q&A session."",
  ""So, with this, let's get started."",
  ""And overall, fiscal year 2023/2024 was a pretty challenging year for both on revenues and profit."",
  ""The headwinds were mainly driven by a very restrictive investment climate in the equipment markets and weaker consumer sentiment in elective procedures, which is for refractive surgery."",
  ""Since last  after nine months, the market environment has hardly seen any improvement against expectations."",
  ""The DORC has been consolidated in H2."",
  ""Please note that the reported numbers all include DORC in the slides."",
  ""The revenue fiscal year 2023/2024 was slightly down minus 1.1% to €2.066 billion."",
  ""Adjusted for currency effects, it was almost unchanged."",
  ""Currency headwinds mostly came from RMB, US dollar and Japanese yen."",
  ""DORC contributed €100 million revenue in H2."",
  ""Excluding DORC, the organic revenue was €1.966 billion, down by minus 5.9% year on year."",
  ""The restrictive investment climate continued to put pressure on equipment sales, most pronounced in North America alongside some core markets in Europe."",
  ""Despite a moderate interest rate cut, we haven't yet seen a clear inflection point in demand."",
  ""Underlying consumables are also weaker year on year, primarily due to a slowdown in refractive treatment pack sales in China following its destocking that we have announced in H1."",
  ""Additionally, hospital utilization slightly declined in summer season."",
  ""Moreover, IOL volume-based procurement has added pressure."",
  ""Despite solid volume growth, revenue and profit having contracted due to significant price cuts."",
  ""We will address both topics around China in more detail later."",
  ""And with this, I would like to go to the whole year's order entry, which was above 2.8% above last year."",
  ""At constant currency, at plus 3.9%."",
  ""Excluding DORC, order entry was still minus 2.5% below last year."",
  ""Order entry has gradually been improving throughout the last few months."",
  ""And in Q4, it turned positive year on year."",
  ""After DORC consolidation, recurring revenue has further expanded to 47%, up from 43% a year ago."",
  ""Reported EBIT amounted to €195 million, a significant minus €44 million decline year-on-year."",
  ""EBIT margin was 9.4% and down from 16.7% last year."",
  ""The adjusted EBIT amounted to €246 million, well within the guided range we gave you in June of this year."",
  ""Adjusted EBIT margin was 12.5%, significantly below previous year's 17.4%."",
  ""So, the main reason for the decline in EBIT were the lower organic revenue trend as well as an unfavorable product mix, especially lower sales of refractive treatment packs."",
  ""And Despite this, strict cost control has shown first results already."",
  ""OpEx, excluding DORC, finished this year slightly lower."",
  ""Resilience measures will continue into fiscal year 2024-2025."",
  ""Our net income dropped by minus 38% from €290 million in the prior year to €179 million, due to lower EBIT, weaker financial results with reduced FX hedging contribution and higher interest expense in the reporting period."",
  ""As a result, earnings per share dropped to €2.01."",
  ""Now, I would like to hand over to Justus who will provide you with more background and will discuss the SBU figures in more depth."",
  "" so much, Justus, and, yeah, let's get started S, let's watch briefly a video that showcases the advancements of this product. ["",
  ""Video Presentation] (00:26:45-00:29:00) So, global cancer burden is expected to rise by 47% from 2020 to 2040, so the next 20 years."",
  ""The brain is especially exposed."",
  ""20% to 40% of all cancer patients develop secondary tumors in the brain."",
  ""So, as a strong anchor product, this new visualization system will help us to build workflow solutions, improving clinical outcome and efficiency for a sustainable and profitable growth."",
  ""AI is not only adopted in our devices, as we just learned about AI-based robotic auto-centering technology in the KINEVO 900 S, but it is also broadly used in our software solutions."",
  ""I'm excited to introduce two latest AI-driven technologies within the Zeiss cataract and retinal workflows, AI IOL calculator and AI-powered CIRRUS PathFinder."",
  ""So, AI IOL calculator is data-driven IOL-powered calculation algorithm and is a core feature of the ZEISS Cataract Workflow."",
  ""It is optimized with a large amount of data for each IOL model it supports and, therefore, does not require IOL constants."",
  ""When applied to short eyes, it has shown great performance and outperformed some state-of-the-art formulas."",
  ""The AI IOL calculator is available in our digital surgery planning software."",
  ""It's also compatible with the ZEISS IOLMaster."",
  ""As an example of the company's digital diagnostic OCT leadership, CIRRUS PathFinder is a fully integrated AI-decision support tool that uses proprietary deep learning algorithms trained by retinal specialists to automatically identify abnormal macular OCT B-scans, assisting with pre-surgical assessments of the retina and optimizing outcomes."",
  ""So, ZEISS CIRRUS PathFinder will be available in selected markets subject to local regulatory clearances and is currently pending CE mark."",
  ""Both solutions highlight how digital technologies within the ZEISS Medical Ecosystem are continuing to set the pace for clinical workflow innovation and foretelling how AI technology will support more personalized patient care in the future."",
  ""So, I'm thrilled to share, this year, SMILE reach its incredible milestone of 10 million eyes treated cumulatively."",
  ""Now, our global installed base has surpassed 2,300 devices."",
  ""Building on this success, we have been working on further advancements in technologies with the VISUMAX 800."",
  ""A key achievement is that surgeons can now treat hyperopia with or without astigmatism with SMILE."",
  ""Clinical studies confirm that SMILE is an effective treatment method for the correction of compound hyperopic astigmatism, demonstrating a high level of efficacy, predictability, safety and stability."",
  ""Now, let's hear directly from surgeons. ["",
  ""Now, let me spend some time on the Chinese refractive market and the new and challenging situation we have been dealing with over the past couple of years."",
  ""So China constitutes 26% of our group revenue currently."",
  ""It is not only the largest market by revenue, but also have an above average share of profitability."",
  ""So, the main reason being a higher proportion of refractive business in the product mix compared to other regions."",
  ""Starting out with some macroeconomic indicators, retail sales and consumer confidence have been under enormous pressure since their peak in 2021 and the environment has deteriorated recently."",
  ""The erosion of residential property values as well as high youth unemployment, particularly among young academics, has taken a lot of momentum out of the refractive market."",
  ""All that being said, our competitive position in China remains excellent."",
  ""Our installed base has roughly doubled in the last five years to more than 1,000 VISUMAX devices even right before the launch of VISUMAX 800."",
  ""A bit more than 15% of these lasers are already at least eight years old."",
  ""These are good candidates for speedy replacement with the launch of our new product."",
  ""With the maturity of our installed base at private clinics, we believe our consumers will be eager to equip – our customers will be eager to equip themselves this new technologies, which gives them a new premium technology to showcase and attract customers, this in an otherwise difficult market."",
  ""Our market share in China has grown throughout this difficult environment and now stands at more than 50% of the market."",
  ""Market data on China is difficult to obtain."",
  ""Through our large installed base and utilization data as well as present in most private clinics, we have one of the best data sets internally available to evaluate the market in its entirety."",
  ""While we prefer to keep some of that knowledge to ourselves for competitive reasons, we can confidently say that most public market research as well as statements by some competitors tend to understate the market size and thereby overstate their own respective market shares."",
  ""We believe the Chinese market to generate close to €3 million refractive procedures on a year basis currently."",
  ""The eyes volumes have doubled roughly in line with the installed base."",
  ""So in 2023/2024, as we moved into the summer main season, We are currently in intense discussions with the regulators and continue to look at potential launch scenarios from VISUMAX 800 in H2 2023/2024."",
  ""We will update you with more precise timing information as soon as possible."",
  ""So longer term, let me reiterate the big picture on China."",
  ""Myopia prevalence is extremely high among our key target group of young academics, it reaches up to 90%."",
  ""Procedure rates across the general population remain a fraction of Western markets."",
  ""However, price declines and the hospital rates since the consumer's recession began have made the treatment more affordable."",
  ""SMILE is seen as the preferred solution for most patients."",
  ""We cover the entire treatment spectrum with the only exception of ICLs, which have an attractive niche position for high myopes, but are not represented across the spectrum where most myopia patients are."",
  ""Over the mid-term, we expect more competition to emerge in China from the likes of So let's stay in China and now talk about the IOL business."",
  ""Our IOL business in China is in strong shape."",
  ""We have grown at 20% CAGR over the past five years and added market share, despite the emergence of some local competitors."",
  ""Our product offering is broad-based across categories."",
  ""We are leading the market for trifocal IOLs by a considerable margin."",
  ""Our overall market share is mid-teens percentage in China, handedly exceeding our global average in IOL business of between 7% to 8%."",
  ""So following the introduction of national-wide volume-based procurement, prices dropped by more than 40% across our portfolio in 2023/2024."",
  ""We adopted a deliberate strategy of keeping the price point Following this harsh price cuts, along with heavy reductions in the distributor margins as well, premium IOLs have now become considerably more affordable."",
  ""These co-payments for patients dropping sometimes as much as half the previous level."",
  ""It has already become clear in the final months of 2023/2024 that volumes would jump and we finished the year with growth of around 30% in volume in a higher than ever premium or presbyopia correcting share in our product mix."",
  ""We expect the trend to continue in 2024/2025 and for IOLs to have a good year now following the price reset."",
  ""Here as well, keep an eye on the long-term outlook for China."",
  ""This slightly less than 5 million eyes treated with IOLs, China is performing less cataract surgeries today than the US, despite having more than 4 times the population."",
  ""The Finally, I would like to provide our outlook on fiscal year 2024/2025."",
  ""So, for 2024/2025, we anticipate a challenging global macroeconomic environment to persist."",
  ""There's no quick recovery expected in investment climate for equipment and continued pressure on consumer spending for elective procedures."",
  ""So, in particular, for 2024/2025, we expect revenue to return to moderate growth driven by the stabilization of recent order intake and full year consolidation of DORC."",
  ""The amount of Cost containment measures will remain in place to maintain a maximum sideways trend in expenses before the impact of DORC's full-year consolidation."",
  ""As discussed, we have identified additional saving potentials as downside protection if markets were to deteriorate from here."",
  ""New product launches, including the KINEVO 900 S and potential additional VISUMAX 800 approvals, especially in the US and in China, provide upsides potential depending on the timing of approvals and the speed of ramp-up."",
  ""The same goes for potential China and other local stimulus packages out of public funding, be it for the consumer or the medtech industry."",
  ""To be precise, we have deliberately set out a conservative guidance excluding most of the new product launch potential wherever registration have not yet been secured."",
  ""While the new product carries significant promise for us, and the strategic value cannot be overestimated, regulatory timing is highly uncertain and we do not want to be – to tie our forecast too closely to approvals such as VISUMAX 800 in US or China as well as KINEVO 900 S in Japan."",
  ""We will keep you updated as we move throughout the year."",
  ""For the long term, a gradual EBITA margin increase is targeted in subsequent years, supported by growth in recurring revenue streams."",
  ""Sustainable potential for the EBITA margin is seen in the range of at least 16% to 20%."",
  ""Lastly, a word of caution on the phasing of our progress this year."",
  ""The dynamics around the new product cycle microsurgery as well as high dependence on equipment revenue from China in the early months of the year will likely cause a weak start into the new fiscal year, both in revenue and EBITA."",
  ""Equipment sales in China are under pressure currently as clinics are waiting for the details of the stimulus to emerge."",
  ""While the refractive destocking happened a year ago, most of the impact took place in Q2 and not in Q1."",
  ""Q1 is more in equipment heavy quarter."",
  ""The strong backlog of equipment we still had at the outset of the past fiscal year has sent us actually this very challenging comps."",
  ""For these reasons, we expect revenues and earnings to be down for the December period year-on-year."",
  ""A rebound is then likely in Q2 as we compare against the intense destocking period in the prior year and the base for comparison gets consecutively easier into Q3 and Q4."",
  ""With this, I  for your attention."",
  ""And now we look forward to your questions."",
  "" for joining us here in Berlin for annual results conference for the fiscal year 2023/2024."",
  ""I'm Sebastian, I'm the Head of Investor Relations."",
  "", everybody, for coming here from different regions of the world, from our analyst and shareholder base."",
  ""We really appreciate spending this conference with you."",
  ""A quick organizational comments and then we can go into the presentation."",
  ""Maybe the Wi-Fi first, because the Wi-Fi from the guest rooms for those who have stayed in the hotel is quite bad down here."",
  ""So, please use this one in the meeting room, and the password is conferences2023."",
  ""On today's agenda, we are planning to spend a maximum of 90 minutes or so on the results presentation and Q&A together with our board of management, who will present to you very shortly."",
  ""And then, we'll have a lunch break."",
  ""And after that, we'll take you – a little bit afternoon, we take you to the Carl Zeiss Meditec facilities in Charlottenburg, which is, I think 15, 20 minutes from here or so."",
  ""We'll have some taxis waiting that will take you there."",
  ""We don't get back to the hotel."",
  ""So, for those who have been staying at the hotel, please take your belongings with you or At 12:45 or so, 1:00 PM, we'll arrive at the BiotechPark where our Carl Zeiss Meditec is located in Charlottenburg, and there we'll have the afternoon session which we will not broadcast live."",
  ""This is about for you to get some learnings in about our products."",
  ""We'll talk about IOLs, we'll talk about the Cataract workflow."",
  ""We'll even do a wet lab surgery."",
  ""So, for those of you aspiring to be ophthalmic surgeons one day, you can have a first go at it without damaging anything, without breaking anything."",
  ""It's really going to be really fun to have you here also to see the production in Berlin."",
  ""And I hope you'll spend a good day, and it will be worth your while for traveling out here."",
  ""So, with no further ado, I'll hand over to you, Markus, to give it a go at our annual results."",
  ""And also, welcome from my side to all of you here in the room and everybody who has connected and dialed in to us."",
  ""So, I'm now going to give you a more detailed overview of our financials, starting with the performance of SBU Ophthalmology."",
  ""Revenue of OPT slightly increased by 0.8% to €1.589 billion."",
  ""At constant currency, it indeed increased by plus 1.8% to €1.605 billion."",
  ""The number contains DORC revenue of €100 million."",
  ""Excluding DORC, revenue of OPT dropped around minus 4% to €1.489 billion currency and acquisition adjusted."",
  ""Underlying top line contraction was reflected in both equipment and consumables."",
  ""In equipment, the decline was most notable in the diagnostics and ophthalmic microscope categories, particularly in North America."",
  ""With consumables, the completion of refractive consumables destocking in the Chinese sales channel, weaker refractive consumables consumption in the summer peak season, as well as price loss caused by volume-based procurement of IOLs are main drivers of the softness."",
  ""We are making further progress in the expansion of the installed base of VISUMAX."",
  ""More on this later in the highlights section of this presentation."",
  ""On the cost side, underlying OpEx saw a slight decrease."",
  ""However, due to the revenue softness, OpEx ratios remained elevated, despite significant cost containment measures."",
  ""Additionally, some DORC-related acquisition effects and CTI impairment placed significant pressure on reported EBIT."",
  ""Regarding DORC, there were significant negative effects pertaining to the opening balance sheet and the PPA process."",
  ""I will go through them later when presenting our adjusted EBIT."",
  ""The local EBIT contribution from DORC was around €9 million, corresponding to a 9% EBIT margin."",
  ""As discussed with our Q3 2023/2024 results, this level is somewhat artificially reduced because we have to continue depreciating certain capitalized R&D that remains on DORC's balance sheet, which has reduced local earnings by €3 million in H2 2023/2024."",
  ""On a comparable basis, the EBIT margin of DORC would have been around 12%, instead of those 9%."",
  ""We expect standalone profitability of DORC to increase significantly into the at least mid to high teens in the coming years as our integration measures begin to kick in."",
  ""However, as DORC will be more closely integrated into OPT, reporting its detailed financial performance only makes limited sense."",
  ""We will continue to commend qualitatively on DORC integration, of course."",
  ""Regarding CTI, we are happy to have launched the MICOR 700 product at the American Academy of Ophthalmology Congress in Chicago in October."",
  ""MICOR 700 is a differentiated instrument that can be an alternative to traditional phacoemulsification."",
  ""While this product is a key launch for us and will strengthen our competitiveness in the cataract markets in the US, we have adopted a more conservative business outlook due to learnings from a pilot launch performed early in 2024, which impacted the carrying value of some of the intangible assets from the acquisition."",
  ""The overall impact on EBIT was €31.5 million, with roughly equal offset booked in net income as we also devalued the corresponding contingent purchase price liabilities."",
  ""All in all, EBIT margin for the SBU OPT substantially dropped a minus 7.5 percentage points to 6.3%."",
  ""Ophthalmology accounted for 77% of the group's total revenue."",
  ""Within Ophthalmology, the recurring revenue accounted for 56%."",
  ""DORC consolidation has contributed to growth in the recurring revenue share."",
  ""Microsurgery sales were under pressure in 2023/2024 caused by the continued investment reluctance in the markets."",
  ""Top line dropped by minus 7% to €477 million, at constant currency 5.6% – minus 5.6%."",
  ""The neurosurgery business faced the strongest headwinds."",
  ""High financing costs particularly impacted leveraged private hospitals."",
  ""These challenges were most pronounced in North America."",
  ""In Europe, markets such as Germany and France experienced slower than usual order intake patterns, driven by political and regulatory uncertainties in the healthcare systems."",
  ""With the passing of healthcare reform in Germany and the first step to a lower interest rate environment in the US, some of these factors have been slightly easing recently."",
  ""We have seen a stabilization in our order intake throughout the summer month already."",
  ""As announced on September 30th, the neurosurgical microscope, KINEVO 900 S, has now been launched in Europe and in the US."",
  ""Markus will provide more details about the new KINEVO later."",
  ""Order entry in Q4 turned positive for the first time during fiscal year 2023/2024."",
  ""As a consequence of the negative top line trend, both gross margin and EBIT margin fell despite a flat OpEx development."",
  ""EBIT margin dropped by minus 5.5 percentage points to 19.7%."",
  ""MCS accounted for 23% of the group's total revenue."",
  ""Within MCS, the recurring revenue accounted for 17%."",
  ""Let's look at the regions."",
  ""By regions, EMEA demonstrated good top line growth, while Americas and Asia Pacific were both under pressure."",
  ""Americas noted sales of €533 million, a drop of minus 7%, at constant currency minus 5%."",
  ""The business is still largely held back by the high interest rate and difficult financing environment."",
  ""Order entry has gradually stabilized throughout the year."",
  ""In EMEA, we noted revenues of €584 million, an increase as reported of plus 13%, at constant currency plus 14%."",
  ""Core markets such as France, Italy and Spain continued showing strong sales and benefited from backlog deliveries."",
  ""Order entry in France and Germany in particular did weaken, however, over the past few months, due most likely to some political and regulatory uncertainty in the healthcare system."",
  ""In Asia Pacific, we noted revenues of €949 million, dropped by minus 5% or at constant currency minus 4%."",
  ""Southeast Asia, India and Australia contributed to a robust performance."",
  ""China, including Hong Kong, moved sideways as a consequence of weaker consumables sales."",
  ""Japan and South Korea reported lower sales as well."",
  ""So, let's have a look at the P&L lines."",
  ""Gross margin with 52.7% was 5 percentage points below previous year's level due to CTI impairment in the cost of goods, negative operating leverage, unfavorable product mix, including lower refractive consumables and volume-based purchase-related price cuts in our IOLs, as well as FX headwinds mainly from RMB, US dollar, and Japanese yen."",
  ""OpEx, excluding DORC consolidation and DORC integration costs, were slightly down in absolute terms by around €10 million year-over-year due to strict cost control measures."",
  ""I will talk more about cost control measures a bit later in the presentation."",
  ""OpEx ratios remained elevated due to the revenue weakness, consequently reported EBIT of €194 million was significantly below previous year's level of €348 million."",
  ""EBIT margin was 9.4% behind previous year's 16.7%."",
  ""In the light of the DORC acquisition, EBITA and EBITA margin will be key indicators for future reporting."",
  ""Therefore, in this table, I'd like to walk you through all adjustments in order to provide a fair comparison for the upcoming years."",
  ""The noncash amortization charges on M&A contain the earlier acquisitions, such as IanTECH, Katalyst and Kogent, as well as the DORC PPA charge and the CTI impairment of €3.15 million."",
  ""After adjustments, EBITA for 2023/2024 was €249 million at an EBITA margin of 12%."",
  ""For adjusted EBIT 2023/2024, we additionally factored out the Topcon one-off payment, the DORC-related integration and inventory step-up effects, as well as the DORC local EBIT contribution."",
  ""This resulted in €246 million, well within the previously guided range, with an adjusted EBIT margin of 12.5%."",
  ""Looking at DORC more in detail, there were a number of special effects."",
  ""In Q4, our regular amortization from the purchase price allocation started with the value of €13 million for H2 2023/2024 on the intangible assets identified in the DORC opening balance sheet."",
  ""In fiscal year 2024/2025, we expect a regular amortization of around €26 million per year to continue on a yearly basis for a bit more than a decade."",
  ""In addition, there were significant negative impacts from the revaluation of inventories in the DORC opening balance sheet."",
  ""The step-up in value reduced H2 2023/2024 earnings by around €8 million."",
  ""Lastly, we had around €16 million in integration expenses, mainly from closing the transaction and certain post-merger integration expenses."",
  ""The total of the integration expenses and inventory step-up, therefore, reached around €24 million."",
  ""Now, a quick overview on the cash flow statement."",
  ""Operating cash flow remains stable at €247 million, previous year €251 million, despite a lower operating result, more efficient working capital management has largely offset the decline."",
  ""Key contributors include reductions in both inventories and accounts receivable."",
  ""Investing cash flow has been significantly reduced, mainly driven by the DORC acquisition and higher CapEx."",
  ""The CapEx ratio was around 7.4%, up 2 percentage points versus last year, reflecting investments in expansion projects in our consumables production, such as Change in financing cash flow was mainly due to issuance of shareholder loan and share buyback."",
  ""Net liquidity was at €73 million and refinanced through the ZEISS Group treasury."",
  ""Net financial debt, including the shareholder loan from ZEISS, was at minus €327 million."",
  ""Now, let's move to the key highlights."",
  ""I'll start with the first topic, our resilience initiatives, and then Marcus will share the progress of our new products and innovations, and address the most discussed topics around China."",
  ""Earlier in the fiscal year, I updated you on our resilience measures designed to improve our cost position and slow down the expense growth."",
  ""Despite suffering an earnings decline in 2023/2024, we evaluate the resilience measures implemented so far as successful."",
  ""Let me elaborate on this by presenting a longer term view."",
  ""The chart shows the quarterly OpEx trend since 2018/2019 on a rolling 12-month average."",
  ""The COVID period in 2019/2020 and 2020/2021 has been excluded as OpEx were not representative in that period."",
  ""Also in recent month, all effects related to DORC, such as consolidated costs of DORC and integration expenses, are adjusted out."",
  ""In 2021/2022, as we emerged from the pandemic, our investments picked up speed."",
  ""Peak growth was reached in Q4 of 2021/2022 when expenses grew by almost 30% against the pre-COVID year."",
  ""When markets began to slow down in fiscal year 2023/2023 (sic) [2022/2023] (00:22:09), we adjusted our spending to bring down the rate of inflation, shortages in the labor market and significant materials inflation, which affected just about every position in the P&L continued to put pressure on our expenses."",
  ""The recent Q4 2023/2024 was an important milestone as we returned to a slightly declining year-over-year OpEx trend for the first time in many years, with comparable OpEx down by around €10 million."",
  ""Initially planned spending was reduced by nearly €100 million to protect earnings, given the unexpected weakness in our top line and gross profit line in 2023/2024."",
  ""This required some heavy lifting as we tried to slow down the expense growth by freezing budgets and headcounts, as well as reprioritizing R&D projects and sales and marketing initiatives, all the while trying to avoid any damage as possible to our future growth and competitiveness."",
  ""With our resilience measures, we are, however, not only following tactical short-term goals in protecting our profitability, but also pursuing longer-term transformation initiatives."",
  ""As briefly described already in previous calls, we are reviewing our business case prioritization aimed at improving focus and productivity, while defunding some weaker investment cases in our portfolio."",
  ""In the area of commercial excellence, we are reviewing our go-to market strategies for key products and ways to raise sales productivity, as well as implement new models such as bundling and providing workflow solutions as a service."",
  ""In the field of innovation excellence, we are reviewing our R&D roadmap and prioritizing the strongest cases, while introducing additional metrics and challenges to make sure our budgets are spent in the most productive possible way."",
  ""Lastly, we are working on our manufacturing footprint, supplier network, and overall capacity position as part of a COGS down project."",
  ""Following a tough period in the global supply chains during the back half of the pandemic, when the key goal was continuity of supply, as well as the painful but necessary decoupling from an established supply route impacted by the Russian war against Ukraine, we ended up in a situation with too much capacity and costs that are too high."",
  ""We are now beginning to renegotiate supplier conditions and streamline our capacities by using the existing flexibility of the organization."",
  ""I'm happy to report that our teams are showing great spirit in handling the situation, and we have not had an increase in employee or middle management turnover despite some tough decisions."",
  ""For 2024/2025, our goal is to keep expenses roughly flat before taking into account the DORC-related effects."",
  ""Should markets get worse from here, we have already identified additional savings potentials in the low- to mid-double digit million range to safeguard earnings from here."",
  ""Other than last fiscal year when our forward guidance was heavily dependent on top line growth, and we got hit severely not only by destocking in the sales channel, but also by weakening equipment and consumables demand, we are in an improved position to work on the cost base to protect the downside to earnings should markets turn further south."",
  ""And with that, let me pass it on to Markus really – real quick here for an organizational announcement at this point.""
]","[
  ""My first question is on your guidance for fiscal 2024/2025 specifically on the margin."",
  ""Considering that you expect a growing top line, you have a pretty weak comp guide."",
  ""You had the consumable destocking last year, plus you've identified further cost savings."",
  ""Why don't you expect a little bit more margin expansion potential?"",
  ""My second question is, whether you can add a little bit more color on the order intake growth in Q4 specifically."",
  ""You spoke about the stabilization in microsurgery."",
  ""What does that mean in numbers?"",
  ""And you've also touched on this weakening order trend in Europe."",
  ""Maybe you could add a little bit more color there as well?"",
  ""Oliver Metzger from ODDO BHF."",
  ""I had two questions on your savings."",
  ""So, first of all, can you quantify the saving impact for this year?"",
  ""So, you mentioned as a target flat OpEx, but this comes in the face of only, let's say, slower moderate growth."",
  ""And the second question is about Okay."",
  ""This is Anchal Verma from JPMorgan."",
  ""Two questions, please, and one is on the margin guide for next year again."",
  ""Just trying to understand a little bit more around the bridge to next year's guidance."",
  ""If I remember correctly, at Q3 results, you had pointed that at least a baseline, we should see destocking recover."",
  ""So that should add approximately €40 million of EBIT, and then you'd have the DORC contribution, and then cost savings which just sounds like it's probably offset by how inflationary costs."",
  ""So, where are we And then in – the second question, please."",
  ""This is a bit more around VBP."",
  ""Could you quantify the headwinds you've seen in FY 2024?"",
  ""What are your expectations for next year?"",
  ""Have you seen any market share shifts?"",
  ""One of your competitor had pointed to a potential tailwind from this."",
  ""So just your thoughts on how we should think of that next year?"",
  ""So, hi, this is Dylan van Haaften with Stifel."",
  ""So, just two, one short, quick one, both on China refractive."",
  ""So, has the transfer price changed on the refractive consumables between Zeiss AG and Carl Zeiss Meditec either last year or next year?"",
  ""And my second question is just on market assumptions."",
  ""So, could we just talk about what the drivers are today?"",
  ""So, I know Lasik versus SMILE mix, is that still expected to be negative?"",
  ""How should we be thinking about case volumes?"",
  ""My initial impressions are maybe mid-single digit down next year."",
  ""And then, maybe on prices, I know on the Lasik side, there's a bit more price pressure."",
  ""I know in the SMILE side, you guys are more protected."",
  ""Could you also guide us there, because I also know after spring, maybe SMILE pro comes in and kind of offsets that?"",
  ""So, any color there would be super valuable."",
  ""It's because my understanding is that when it comes to the distribution agreement between Zeiss AG and Carl Zeiss Meditec, there is essentially a, I think, euro-quoted transfer price."",
  ""But there's a local currency sale."",
  ""And I would just be interested in understanding if – my understanding is that at least that transfer price hasn't changed for refractive consumables lately and I was just intrigued to hear if it's going to change in the future."",
  ""Julien Ouaddour from BofA. Maybe a follow-up to the previous question on refractive in China."",
  ""Can you talk a bit more about the upcoming competition?"",
  ""I think you mentioned a few names."",
  ""I think there's also, let's say, like local competitors here."",
  ""When do you see them basically coming in the market?"",
  ""And I mean, you showed us some, I mean, like a slide where you have 50% market share."",
  ""How can you protect your market share?"",
  ""And I mean, could it impact either your volume or your price in the future?"",
  ""My other question is on the top line guidance."",
  ""So, you said modest growth, including the DORC impact."",
  ""I think there's like the consumable destocking, like the consumable, like, reversal as well."",
  ""Should we understand that the organic growth really would be relatively flattish and can you compare it to the market growth that you expect?"",
  ""This is usually what you – like what you do."",
  ""And my final question will be on Hi, guys."",
  ""It's Sam England from Berenberg."",
  ""The first one, can you just give us some more color on the longer term margin guide?"",
  ""And I suppose, what were the key moving parts where your assumptions have changed on long-term margins over the last year, be it China And then, the second part around the longer term guide as well is to what extent is delivery on that target range reliant on cost-cutting and efficiencies versus operating leverage and revenue growth?"",
  ""And I suppose, to get to the top end of that guidance range over the next three or four years, what sort of recovery in the business is it going to require?"",
  ""Just two questions for me."",
  ""So, your comparative is quite soft And my second question would be with regards to refractive demand."",
  ""Do you have a sense of what percentage of procedures on the VISUMAX are Lasik now versus say two years ago?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Just one for me and it's on the topic of innovation."",
  ""So,  very much for providing a bit more detail on the technical capabilities and improvement on the new KINEVO and VISUMAX products."",
  ""But what I really like to hear more about, if possible, is how do you see the size of the commercial opportunity of those launches?"",
  ""Is there any color you can share on pricing update versus previous generations?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""So, maybe I give you some indication of order entry and I think Justus will give you some more details then potentially in the numbers."",
  ""So, first of all, what we have seen is indeed as we reported, Falko, that there was some weaknesses last year, especially also in US in terms of capital equipment and investment schemes there."",
  ""And we have seen that this has been turned around now in the last months."",
  ""One of the reason has been indeed is the change in interest rates in US."",
  ""But also that we see that, let's say, the saturation of the market based on the high order entry during the pandemics is now done and that now actually hospitals are starting to reinvest again."",
  ""And this is something what we see depending country-by-country because this is really something what we also have seen now especially last year that there the specific team on the respective country has increased and that's also because of the reimbursement, thinking about Germany now and Yeah."",
  ""So, maybe I'll start to give you a little bit of perspective because – so what we see is that our positioning in the market is pretty rich, yeah?"",
  ""So, we have really a very good positioning in the market, and this positioning is driven because of our innovation power."",
  ""So, for us, it's really important to balance on the one hand, let's say, the activities, long-term and mid-term activities in R&D, but also in sales and marketing."",
  ""So that's one really crucial and important thing because this is the DNA of our company."",
  ""And this is nothing what we want to jeopardize."",
  ""So that really means to understand."",
  ""And we are always talking about our anchor products."",
  ""Maybe you remember that anchor product means The other thing is, so we actually – we are now optimizing."",
  ""So we started to optimize the structure, now we are optimizing the processes."",
  ""And there is efficiency gains."",
  ""But we are leveraging what we have already addressed, and this is the program, what Justus mentioned, which is a corporate program for everybody, where we on the one hand had cost avoidance and cost-cutting measures, on the other hands, efficiency and productivity gains what we want to realize."",
  ""And this is now also to convert, for instance, processes from manual to digital."",
  ""We are working on the SAP S/4HANA integration, which will generate then more benefits for us where we have then cost savings."",
  ""So having this said, why not now going even more stricter because we strongly believe on actually that the market is recovering because the cases are there."",
  ""So, that's the big difference now maybe to other industries."",
  ""So when we are talking about myopia, when we are talking about non-elective procedures, they are there."",
  ""And this is actually where we are currently also doing the transformation."",
  ""On the one hand pushing refractive, while knowing that the refractive laser surgery is one of the key, let's say, innovative elements when it comes to myopia and presbyopia."",
  ""The other things are the non-elective procedure."",
  ""That was one of the reasons to acquire DORC was actually to get this consumable business on procedures which are – has to be done because otherwise the patient is suffering."",
  ""And that's a big difference to laser refractive surgery."",
  ""And this is something what we are doing and we are investing in this, so to balance that."",
  ""So, if we see now that the entire market is going in a higher depression, then for sure, we can go in a parametric approach and then cutting elements out of this until we are coming, really, to the core."",
  ""And this is exactly what the team has prepared so that we go stages by stages if we see that the market becomes even more softer, then we can go in the next level, we have prepared that already and we can go there."",
  ""Maybe I'll take the second question and Justus will take the first."",
  ""So, NVBP and I'm not sure on which competitor you're referring to, but there has been different strategies and tactics to position there."",
  ""Our strategy was to say we have a high-quality product to price, which is fair."",
  ""And what we did was that we said, okay, we are focusing on premium lenses and not so much on the mono focals."",
  ""In the mono focal lenses for the NVBP, there is also a lot of local players."",
  ""And the price was very much under pressure."",
  ""So having this said, I think we are – and this goes along with our brand, we have positioned – as I already stated before, we have positioned our lenses on a higher price level."",
  ""We see that the volumes are going up because also for the private clinics and hospitals, this is attractive."",
  ""So that we see a shift from public usage towards private usage."",
  ""And that actually here our unit numbers are going significantly up."",
  ""And as I said, we understand then as long as the NVBP is running, that this trend will continue."",
  ""So, maybe I take the second one and maybe you can briefly talk about transfer prices."",
  ""As far as I know, there is, but maybe you are coming."",
  ""But – so, first of all, I think just being in Shanghai and in China in the last couple of weeks talking here to the teams but also now, for instance, in Taiwan and South East Asia."",
  ""So, first of all, what we see is indeed that there are a kind of higher – currently a higher demand for price-sensitive procedures, Lasik, and this is something that we see."",
  ""Nevertheless, the SMILE is on a high level and the customers have a high interest also to keep that price level."",
  ""We will come this new innovation here."",
  ""So, we have, for instance, the entire workflow, VISULYZE 4.0."",
  ""So, that means we are combining now SMILE with VISULYZE 4.0, which brings additional value to the patient."",
  ""And with this, we can keep the prices or our customers can keep the prices."",
  ""Secondly, then, with the VISUMAX 800, there will be then SMILE pro and then we have also again two stages, because then we have SMILE pro and we have on top of this then SMILE pro with VISULYZE 4.0 with the workflow solution."",
  ""And this is then the absolute premium offering and this is something what our customers can utilize and this will keep the prices on the level as they are."",
  ""So, what we also do is, quite importantly, we keep, I would call it, So, overall, to give you that – the perspectives, so what we see is that, yes, there will be, again, pressure on the prices, that's clear."",
  ""It stayed also in the past, by the way."",
  ""It's not like that this is really new."",
  ""So, there was always a pressure on the market."",
  ""But the answer from us is to bring new innovations to the customer and to the patient so that the patient is willing to pay a higher price, and this is exactly what the team is doing."",
  ""Also, what we said before with Okay."",
  ""So, the first question concerning competition in China, so the refractive laser is a very special topic, to be honest, because it's not only technologies."",
  ""When you're thinking about a femtosecond laser or an excimer laser, I would say about everybody can build this laser."",
  ""The point is then the combination of the entire system."",
  ""And the beam steering and the interaction with the patient, and that makes it very, very particular here how we are doing that."",
  ""The other thing, second part – this is really very protective."",
  ""Second part is – are the nomograms."",
  ""What is meant as nomograms, this is actually the interaction of the laser with the cornea."",
  ""Since the cornea is a fiber material, so it's not a kind of heterogeneous material, the understanding how the laser's interacting with the cornea, that's one of the core element."",
  ""And this is something you can only get if you have thousands of patient data and that makes it for competition, even for start-up companies super tough actually to start in because the outcomes."",
  ""What we have learned over decades now is inherent in the system, it's just not available for them."",
  ""And this is also something where – then because of the beam pass, because of the way how we are shaping the beam, you can even – if you would get nomograms and by competition, they would be not able to adapt that so easily because the beam behavior of the laser is different to that what we have."",
  ""So, it means it's very specific."",
  ""It's based on hundreds of thousands of data coming from the patients, which are then actually fitted into the system, which is very specific for the system."",
  ""So, that makes it really very, very protective, not only in IP, because people will always say it as IP, that's the one thing."",
  ""The other thing is actually this very special topic what is for refractive quite important."",
  ""That's maybe the first question."",
  ""Second part was that IOL and I think the future."",
  ""Well, yes, so, IOLs, for sure, there's local competition already coming up and that's clear."",
  ""But you have to be aware of that we are really very well positioned within China and that we are the only company as far as I know which has production in China and we are actually producing or it's starting now."",
  ""We got the first confirmation, approval now for one of our lenses and that means that we will produce then locally."",
  ""So, that means we So, we strongly believe that the future lays not only in single devices, but in the entire ecosystem."",
  ""And the ecosystem means then, in this case, not only lenses, it means all the So, just to give you a feeling, I was – when I was in Shanghai talking to one of the surgeons, actually, she said – it was 5 PM in the evening, and she said, I still have 80 cases, and she was working then over the night, yeah, so until midnight."",
  ""But she said, it's all about productivity."",
  ""So – but we have to think about this, actually, in the future, this will be not a single device or a single consumable topic."",
  ""In the future, there will be – it's all about solutions, it's all about efficiency over the solutions and how to make it really effective."",
  ""And this is where we believe also what we have shown you in combination with The last point was?"",
  ""So, we definitely expect to grow and to outgrow the market."",
  ""So, maybe to say that in that way."",
  ""But it's really, and this goes a little bit along with that, what I said before, market is not market."",
  ""So, this is really something what we have seen now, just the decoupling of the systems that sometimes you have a tailwind and sometimes you're getting in the same market headwinds now over the time."",
  ""So, for instance now China."",
  ""So, China is one – is our most important market after US or US – so, first China then US."",
  ""And what we see is the new market dynamics in the respective markets, depending on the different, let's say, devices and subsegments of the market."",
  ""This is something – when you're looking to your models, you have to carefully model in."",
  ""So, market is not market there, as you know."",
  ""And so, what we see is that, overall, we see that our market share is stable, and it might vary from some of the devices or something like that."",
  ""So, we see, for instance, in diagnostics, we see some shifts."",
  ""On other things, like on operation microscopes, we see a market share gain."",
  ""We see the same in refractive."",
  ""So, this is currently something – when you go to the charts and looking then to Gartner or whatever, then you can read it easily out."",
  ""Maybe I'll take the first question, you the second one, is that okay?"",
  ""So, concerning product mix and how we see the margin overall, yes, indeed, the point is that what we do is or – so, on the one hand, we have one big pillar and that's refractive, so – and we are working on that, heavily investing, and also to give you a feeling, when it comes to R&D, actually, our R&D is in most cases actually the size of where others have top line."",
  ""So, this is really – it's a heavy investment for us, where we are actually investing in future things for – not only for the femtosecond laser, but also for the excimer laser and the entire combination."",
  ""So, that means we expect that in the future, we will be able to provide this SMILE technology actually every, let's say, refractive correction error, what you can have, yeah, so that means hyperopia, myopia and presbyopia."",
  ""And this will be available then for all key markets worldwide."",
  ""So, that's one of the big topics and we strongly believe that with our offerings what we have and also the value-add what we have that this will have a good, good gross margin overall with volume effects, yeah, because it's also quite important."",
  ""So, that's the first part."",
  ""Second part is then – is the, I would say, traditional device business."",
  ""So, a transactional business and operation microscopes, in other devices, diagnostic devices like IOLMaster, which has a very good reasonable margin, where we are working also on COGS down, so on cost of goods sold down, where – to make sure that the margins are up, on the other hand, having innovations in place, also in this consumables part."",
  ""So, when you're thinking, for instance, now in operation microscopes, then you need And the last big part where we are investing and have invested heavily is actually in this entire nonelective features, and there especially the consumables."",
  ""And it could be captives or non-captives consumables, this has not always the same high margin, like now for instance for refractive, but be aware of that also the entire OpEx then is different, so sales and marketing costs are different, because you have a different interaction with the customer."",
  ""So, as I said already, it's – and Justus also stated, so I would not look now month-to-month, yeah, because there are always variations and variances."",
  ""So, I would really look now maybe to the first quarter, and especially, to the peak season, which is coming, to get a better understanding what is happening, because what I can tell you is, yes, we have seen that the market was – is softening."",
  ""But we also see that this can change fast, yeah, and from this point of view, already now to predict based on that what we see currently what will happen for the rest of the year is pretty, to be honest."",
  ""So, I'm not able to give you there any forecast and prediction."",
  ""What we will do is, first of all, and it's very important for me, we see nicely how actually our customers are doing and how the variations are looking here."",
  ""And I think we will provide the best service to our customers to make sure that they can attract in the best way the patients' potential, and that's, for instance, now also marketing material."",
  ""So, you will see that when you go to China or Taiwan, then you see that actually our customers are using the Zeiss brand, as we said that before, in a very, let's say, offense or in a very aggressive or positive aggressive way, with the brand Zeiss, actually to make the difference to others."",
  ""And with this, we strongly believe that – also with the higher installed base, more to come now also But I think what is really important is to understand that we have share – we have gained market share, not only in SMILE, but also in Lasik."",
  ""So, it means this is combo systems and combi systems where you can actually do everything what you want."",
  ""Especially, in a combination with the MEL 90 and the VISUMAX, you can do every procedure what is possible, and for sure, we are offering and we are convinced that SMILE is the best possible solution, but Lasik is also a good procedure, don't misunderstand us."",
  ""And that means, we also are – we are actually striving not only to gain full market share and market leadership in SMILE, but also in Lasik, and that's, for instance, another reason for us to go also to US, but knowing that US is very much on Lasik, where we can start with Lasik as an anchor point, and then moving over to SMILE."",
  ""I'll take the first one, and Justus will take the margin question."",
  ""So first of all, actually the integration, as you know, so we had a closing in April."",
  ""It's actually, ahead of plan, so we had the first markets now integrated especially US but also China which is the most important market for us."",
  ""And we see also a lot of momentum here in the teams already and we have a role in plan now for the next 12 months in terms of sales integration over the markets."",
  ""So, this is quite positive."",
  ""The teams are super positive here and we see a lot of potential."",
  ""And the good news is also we have already been able to leverage synergies not only on synergies now in R&D, but especially also in sales."",
  ""So, the first orders of the joint teams are now coming in and now the key element will be actually to provide enough capacity to get the upside here."",
  ""So, this is actually currently good news."",
  ""So these, as usual, there are still, let's say, always operational topics to make sure."",
  ""But overall, the market sentiment is super strong and we see that the synergies are working and the teams are working pretty well."",
  ""And I think this goes along also, what I described before, with the transformation what we do in sales."",
  ""So, actually, we have a new account management running in the countries, so that we can offer the full solutions and that we can have a cross-talking also when it comes to consumables, so because DORC is not only providing consumables and capitals for retinal market but also for the cataract market."",
  ""And this is, as you know, since we are also very strong in cataract, this is really a lot of synergies we can leverage."",
  ""So, so overall, I think this is good."",
  ""But again, I think the important thing is now to make sure that we can scale, and that we can scale the wonderful products what DORC has to a level so that we can use the potential, what we can get out of the market with our sales force of size, that this is fitting together and this is where teams are currently working on."",
  ""So, maybe to start with DORC, so, what we expect, as you know, we are currently quite conservative, but what we expect are single-digit growth here together with the team."",
  ""The synergies to be leveraged, we will see depending also now on regulatory and active approval processes."",
  ""But overall, we see again a super strong momentum in the market."",
  ""We have to make sure now that we can leverage all the opportunities what we see."",
  ""And that's then – especially also a capacity topic."",
  ""Our now joint teams are working on that and which is also a great topic because – so in our operations and also supply chain management is working to make sure that we can then also satisfy the demand coming out of the markets, not only in US but also in other markets like China where you know we are super strong and where we have a lot of interest on, especially on I think you said it already before."",
  ""So, our expectation is that we are growing at least with the market."",
  ""So, we have heavily invested in R&D and sales and marketing, and it's clear that this investment has to come back."",
  ""So, whenever you have a market model, I would assume that we grow this to market or outgrow the market."",
  ""I think that, first of all, includes DORC, yeah?"",
  ""And the reason is that we have now a very soft start into the fiscal year with the announcement of a stimulus package, yeah?"",
  ""We basically see that this is worse than anything else, yeah, because then everybody stops basically in China and holds back on investment decisions."",
  ""So therefore, we are cautious for your expectations for Q1."",
  ""On the new KINEVO.Some comment on the Q&A. I would suggest we do a few alternating rounds here in the room, and then we also go to the online questions."",
  ""For those participating online who would like to ask a question, why don't you put up your hand already."",
  ""And after going through the room, I will call you up."",
  ""You can alternatively also put your question to the Zoom chat if you prefer to do that, and we will deal with it here in the room."",
  ""So yeah, let's start Falko from Deutsche Bank."",
  ""Please speak into the microphone on the desk."",
  ""On the – on your question on why not more positive on the margin guidance."",
  ""I think, first of all, you all know where we come from."",
  ""And frankly, to be a bit more cautious and conservative after the heavy profit warning that we had to give in June of this year, I think given the current situation with headwinds not really easing off, I think is the more prudent thing to do."",
  ""So, as you have heard Markus explaining, the trends, especially in the Chinese, refractive business are still difficult."",
  ""We still see pressure here on margins."",
  ""And we clearly – for the market in China, we clearly need the introduction of SMILE pro to have something in the hands of our customers that actually helps them to best position the pricing at a reasonable level."",
  ""So, we see that somewhat reflected in that guidance."",
  ""And lastly, I would reiterate that the first for us really important milestone in this fiscal year to give more clarity on guidance is around early February."",
  ""Early February, Chinese New Year will be January 29."",
  ""So, the occasion around Chinese New Year is the – a winter peak."",
  ""And that will indicate the appetite of consumers to undergo procedures."",
  ""It will give us a bit of time to see whether the stimulus is already showing impact in China."",
  ""And last but not least, let's also not forget if I'm not mistaken, January 21, the Trump administration will take over, and that may have impacts both on China, most likely also on the US market."",
  ""And you can see that all these uncertainties in two of our most important markets, I think, are calling for being a bit careful with the guidance, yeah."",
  ""I mean, on your question on the OpEx target for next year, I'm not sure whether I understood the question 100%, but, I mean, flat OpEx is what we are aspiring, and that means that we basically have to compensate all inflationary pressure, payroll pressure, and so on."",
  ""You know that, you know, a good number of our employees are in Germany."",
  ""You know what you can expect here in Germany in terms of tariff increases."",
  ""So that means whatever that pressure is will be compensated by countermeasures on the other side."",
  ""And with that, obviously, assuming that we will see in the second half of the year and growth, that will basically mean that productivity and efficiency is focus."",
  ""And on the margin guidance, actually not so much to add what was said before."",
  ""So, first of all, you're obviously right saying, well, now, I can – I take basically the baseline of last year and now I add back the destocking impact, and then I addback – add DORC, and then I have some OpEx saving and then I'm wherever."",
  ""So, that mechanically is understood."",
  ""However, we are not in a static market."",
  ""And I think you heard us saying that not only was the summer peak in China softer than what we had expected, actually since then, we are seeing that consumer confidence, you saw the chart, has actually reached record low levels."",
  ""And we obviously also hear that feedback from our customers, our clinics."",
  ""So, going back to the guidance logic, we, in that circumstances, need to actually be prepared that some of the destocking upside may be consumed by the softness of the market."",
  ""And that's why I said to your colleague's earlier question that I think only in the mid of Q2, we will know better whether the consumer confidence returns, where we see the correlation between, on the one hand side, a stimulus package announcement or then potentially already rolled in, and a clear impact on the belief of consumers that overall things get brighter or so."",
  ""So, I think that is one of the key factors."",
  ""I think the OpEx comment I made before, also want to reiterate again that obviously it's not for the, let's say, lack of ambition to also work further on cost reductions."",
  ""But I'd also make a clear statement whenever you go into really deep cost cuts, you better make sure that you understand what is the reasons for the weakness that you're going through."",
  ""And in terms of our competitive position, I cannot see neither in refractive nor in cataract, nor in the posterior segment vitrectomy, nor in MCS that there's a material difference in our position to where we were before."",
  ""So, after talking a lot here about attracting and retaining talents that we need for an innovation pipeline and the ambition of our innovation, I think it would be not in the best interest of our investors if we were now kind of trying to potentially identify more savings at the expense of the talent that we have on board."",
  ""Let's go to Dylan and then to Julien."",
  ""Can you – just to make sure that I really understand your question, can you repeat it, please?"",
  ""Competition in China was the first one."",
  ""That was on the top line guidance, what do we expect in terms of organic growth and how does it compare to market expectations, the market growth expectations."",
  "" In the same manner, just trying to build on what Marcus said and if – in the long-term model that you want to build, you want to understand what is room for OpEx and OpEx ratios and so on."",
  ""I'd say that the one thing I believe is, you will have seen our R&D ratio peaking."",
  ""You can expect us to continue to, in terms of a ratio, invest more than our competitors into R&D. But with the level of 16.6% I think that we have just displayed here, I think that returning to market growth and following our strategic initiative pipeline, I think you should see that somewhat tailing off now."",
  ""In terms of sales and marketing, as Marcus just said, he almost gave the answer."",
  ""I think, with changed business models, you may see a shift in inside of sales and marketing in terms of what sort of profiles we need in our teams."",
  ""But I think, overall, with the sales and marketing cost ratio, currently reluctant here to commit to any significant reduction."",
  ""In G&A, I think by and large, what you will see in the next years is a bit of a pressure that we get from that transformation from SAP R/3 to S4."",
  ""Unfortunately, SAP is basically pushing all his global customer base to transform that, and obviously, it's not a trivial exercise to undergo."",
  ""That will require some additional investments, at least for an intermediary period."",
  ""But other than that, I'd say, by and large, with the current ratios for our administrative expenses, you can calculate."",
  ""Let's take some online questions next."",
  ""I got Thyra Lee, please."",
  ""And the second part was you were asking about Lasik versus SMILE today versus two years ago."",
  ""I mean, today, I think we said it already, we are at a ratio 70/30, 70% SMILE versus 30% Lasik."",
  ""Frankly, I don't have the data now from two years ago here at hands."",
  ""I would assume, two years ago, you're referring to pretty much the peak times of our refractive treatments in China, where you most likely will have seen the ratio, rather 85% versus 15% or so."",
  ""That is my best guess, but I would have to go into our files."",
  ""I don't have it here in front of me."",
  ""I got Richard Felton next, please."",
  ""It's fair for you to ask that question."",
  ""And what I can offer you is basically to compare with previous flagship MCS product launches."",
  ""And so, we clearly see an opportunity."",
  ""And again, first, we go through a phase of book building for this KINEVO 900 as we obviously know pretty well, what is typically a conversion rate between a project turning into an order, and then an order turning into a delivery."",
  ""But I think to cut the story short here, there is clearly a potential good double-digit million additional EBITA upside, if we were to achieve proportionally same sales numbers pro rata."",
  ""Of course, in this year, that will only be a 50% of what we can count for, given that we think we need the first half of the year for this book building period, so to speak, and then the second to ship and deliver."",
  ""But the range is clearly that this is certainly contributing double-digit-million EBITA number, and in the, let's say, lower double digits, of course."",
  ""But it can be meaningful."",
  ""I hope that gives you enough color."",
  ""I see Jack Reynolds, please."",
  ""And, Jack, on your margin question, I think we clearly expect for this fiscal year a mid-teens EBIT margin."",
  ""And that obviously is driven by, as Markus just said, let's say the first phase of scaling."",
  ""And I think, we clearly think over time there's more potential by, A, further scaling and secondly, of course, by the higher installed base then driving the captive consumable business following it."",
  ""So, I think that is the guidance that I'd give you today."",
  ""And I think your other question was on the growth, whether the organic growth will be negative."",
  ""I'm not sure, Markus, do you want to address that... Yeah, it's basically some operational headwinds that we had to deal with in operations."",
  ""And there was a significant ramp-up in capacity in this year that, however, had some extra expense and that is pretty much explaining a gap here."",
  ""But that was mainly one-offs."",
  ""And in the meantime, we have successfully managed that ramp-up and have consistent performance on that level."",
  ""And with that, I – going forward, I see the recovery of the margins to the originally guided level."",
  ""Looking at the room here, we are a little bit over time."",
  ""But if there's any final one or two from the room, we could go for it."",
  ""What I meant was specifically on KINEVO and for this fiscal year."",
  ""And there is other products like the VISUMAX, as we said, where we are careful and have not included it in the guidance due to the registry approvals that we do not hold yet in our hands, and where there is always some uncertainty in terms of will we get it point in time, where the approvals can then still turn into instalments prior to the summer peaks, yeah."",
  ""And that could become a pretty meaningful differentiator for achieving additional revenue and net contribution to bridge where potentially your models may be sitting versus the guidance that we have given, now."",
  ""I think  very much for the discussion to all those here and to those participating online."",
  ""So, this will conclude the streaming session as well."",
  ""And to those who stay here with us in Berlin a little longer, then, looking forward to chatting a bit further over lunch."",
  ""And then at 12:15 roughly, so in about 40 minutes, we will get going to the Carl Zeiss facilities.""

  ""It's my pleasure to join you today."",
  ""In the interim nine months of 2024, Inditex saw a very robust operating performance, driven very much by the creativity of our teams and the strong execution of our fully integrated business model."",
  ""This performance relies on the four key pillars of the strategy we have been presenting throughout the year, our unique fashion proposition, an optimized customer experience, our focus on sustainability, and the talent and commitment of our people."",
  ""These are the principal factors driving our differentiation."",
  ""The Autumn/Winter collections have been very well received by our customers."",
  ""In the nine months 2024, sales in constant currency grew 10.5%, showing very satisfactory development both in stores and online."",
  ""Sales were positive in all concepts."",
  ""In that same period, net sales grew 7.1% to reach €27.4 billion."",
  ""We continue to operate with very healthy margins on sales across the different lines of the income statement."",
  ""The execution of the business model has also been very robust with controlled cost management."",
  ""Profit before taxes increased 9.9% to €5.8 billion."",
  ""On the bottom line, net income increased 8.5% to €4.4 billion."",
  ""The operating performance of the group further underpins our sound financial position."",
  ""We have generated significant free cash flow over the period."",
  ""You will note this strong performance has continued into the fourth quarter."",
  ""Store and online sales in constant currency between the 1st of November and the 9th of December grew 9%."",
  ""Our diversified presence in 214 markets with low market penetration across the board offers us significant global growth opportunities."",
  ""We have complete confidence in our ability to grow this business, mainly because the model we operate is entirely unique."",
  ""This in turns drives the increasing differentiation we have all been seeing."",
  ""I will hand you over to Ignacio to go into some of the headline numbers."",
  ""I'm going to cover some of the recent initiatives which have been driving the increasing levels of differentiation."",
  ""Our priority remains to continually increase the appeal of our fashion proposition."",
  ""Creativity, innovation, design and quality are defining features of our collections and a key focus across all our teams."",
  ""Our meticulous design process impacts every detail of our garments and collections, while striving to provide the latest quality fashion to customers around the world."",
  ""Our approach involves integrating the talent of our designers with highly artisanal tasks carried out by our skilled teams and the latest technological solutions to achieve the highest levels of quality and sustainability."",
  ""The results of this unique integrated approach can be clearly seen in the multiple collections we offer every season and our swift response to customer demands."",
  ""We continue generating a very broad range of fashion propositions for each of our differentiated concepts."",
  ""The focus on an ever more enhanced customer experience comes as a result of the continuous process of upgrading stores with strong architectural features and with highly curated internal spaces."",
  ""One of the recent flagship projects has been the opening of the Zara Man store at Madrid Hermosilla."",
  ""With more than 700 square meters spread over two floors, this integrative space is located in the heart of Madrid's Salamanca District."",
  ""Each area of Zara Man Hermosilla has been carefully adapted to Zara Man collections and offers a unique shopping experience."",
  ""This very unique landmark store opened at the end of November and is an example of our continued optimization program."",
  ""This project is similar to previous dedicated standalone Zara Man stores in Milan and Barcelona."",
  ""The former Zara Man space at the neighboring Serrano store will host a new The Apartment section,  to our integrated store and online model, our teams have been able to take advantage of the remarkable growth opportunities we see across all channels, concepts and markets."",
  ""Underpinning this growth are new openings, enlargements and refurbishments of stores in the best locations, expanding to new cities and new territories, and the launch of new services that enhance the customers' shopping experience."",
  ""As we have mentioned previously, all our concepts remain very active."",
  ""The roll-out in new locations like Massimo Dutti's launch in Miami Aventura Mall or Stradivarius' and Bershka's flagship stores in Berlin are good examples."",
  ""We also continue optimizing our store presence in all concepts, with key projects like Bershka Madrid Gran Vía, Zara Home Dubai Mall and Oysho A Coruña Plaza de Lugo."",
  ""The full implementation of the new security technology at Zara by the end 2024 is going to plan."",
  ""In 2025, we will roll this out in the concepts, beginning with Bershka and Pull&Bear."",
  ""As part of our commitment to the development of new raw materials, Inditex has approved an investment in Epoch BioDesign, a start-up that uses artificial intelligence to design enzymes that allow the recycling of mixed plastic and textiles."",
  ""This alternative allows the transformation of textile waste into the equivalent of virgin materials, promoting textile-to-textile circularity."",
  ""Our Sustainability Innovation Hub currently works with more than 350 start-ups."",
  ""At Inditex, we are firmly committed to the training and development of our people as fundamental pillars to drive our transformation and guarantee the leadership of the future."",
  ""We have launched the Creatives program, an initiative to identify and enhance the talent of the new generation of designers in our creative teams."",
  ""Hand in hand with the best fashion schools in the world, we are looking for new talent to whom we offer a unique experience of training and professional development."",
  ""The participants have begun their journey with us through a comprehensive training program that provides them with key tools to successfully face the challenges of a constantly evolving industry."",
  ""Let me now move to the outlook for the remainder of 2024."",
  ""We are on track to deliver upon all of our long-term goals."",
  ""The talent, commitment and passion of our teams all around the globe will always be key to our competitive edge."",
  ""We offer a unique fashion proposition defined by creativity, innovation, design and quality."",
  ""The continuous optimization of the customer experience is central to our approach."",
  ""We operate in 214 markets with low share in what continues to be a highly fragmented sector and we see strong growth opportunities."",
  ""To meet the current strong demand, which builds on the significant growth of the business in 2022 to 2023, we are undertaking a number of initiatives."",
  ""We are investing to scale our capabilities, obtain efficiencies and increase our competitive differentiation to the next level."",
  ""The growth of annual gross space in the period 2024 to 2026 is expected to be around 5%."",
  ""Over this same time period, Inditex expects space contribution to sales to be positive in conjunction with a strong evolution of online sales."",
  ""For 2024, we estimate ordinary capital expenditure of approximately €1.8 billion."",
  ""This investment is principally directed at optimization of commercial space, its technological integration, and improvement of our online platforms."",
  ""A brief note on dividends."",
  ""The final dividend payment for 2023 of €0.77 per share was made on the 4th of November."",

  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Just on the flooding that took place, the very sad events in Spain a month or so ago, can you just talk about any impact or not as the case may be from that please, be it on sales sort of or logistics more broadly?"",
  ""I just wondered if you could comment on the competitive environment in the quarter in fashion."",
  ""I know you don't like to get too into quarterly gross margin comments and so on."",
  ""But I wondered if you could talk in general terms about what you're seeing in terms of competitive environment, promotional environment, also any sort of FX and external sourcing headwinds impacting the gross margin or expectations for the second half."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Has the online sales mix increased across the nine months year-on-year?"",
  ""And how has click and collect versus home delivery been trended?"",
  ""Just be interested in sort of overall dynamics in the online space, please."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""I had a question just on whether you're targeting more and you see a gap in the younger market."",
  ""Just very quickly, can you give us a feel for what you think wage growth will do for your business next year compared to this year?"",
  ""Should we expect a little bit of a step-down?"",
  ""And if so, at what sort of magnitude, please?Well,  for the question."",
  ""Well, it's important to highlight that the growth of the group is broad-based and not dependent on a single commercial initiative, just like it's not dependent on a single market, as Marcos has just mentioned."",
  ""We see opportunities for growth in different segments, in different concepts and in all of our markets."",
  ""As we mentioned in our presentation, we remain with an important focus on the improvement of the customer experience, consistent with our store optimization program."",
  ""And with that in mind, we have been opening several standalone Zara Man stores in key locations such as Barcelona Paseo de Gracia, Milan Vittorio Emanuele or the recent Hermosilla, Madrid."",
  ""At the end of 2024, we will have 90 standalone Zara Man stores, The Apartment is a highly curated space, which combines a premium part of the Zara Woman and Zara Home collections, and this initiative is currently available in A Coruña Compostela since September 2023 and in Paris Rue du Bac since May 2024 with very, very positive performance and very positive feedback from our customers."",
  ""As we mentioned in the presentation, The Apartment will open in Madrid Serrano in 2025 in the space vacated by the Zara Man section moved to its own standalone store in Hermosilla."",
  ""Well, we are on track in the ordinary investments and the logistic expansion plans we announced in March."",
  ""In the case of the logistic expansion plan, the new distribution center for Zara, Zaragoza II, will begin its operations in May, June 2025."",
  ""As a reminder this plan is consistent with the evolution of our business and builds on the significant growth that we have experienced recently."",
  ""At the same time, it's consistent with our ambition to keep on offering our customers what they are looking for, where, when and how they want."",
  ""On the space growth, as you know, we do not provide disclosure on quarterly basis."",
  ""But I can confirm that net space was positive in the first nine months and that the space growth for the year is also on track."",
  ""And just to give you an additional color, to give you two examples of our store optimization strategy, we have recently reopened our stores in LA Topanga and Tampa International Plaza, both in the US."",
  ""Both the stores have gone from space below 1,000 square meters to over 2,500 square meters, with a significant improvement of the customer experience."",
  ""Performance and feedback have been very positive so far."",
  "" to all of those participating in the presentation today."",
  ""For any additional questions you may have, please get in touch with our Capital Markets Department, and we will welcome you back in March for the full year 2024 results."",
  ""The first question goes to Georgina Johanan from JPMorgan."",
  ""The first thing we would like to say is that, obviously, our condolences to the people involved in that tragedy."",
  ""I think that the company has responded through – in two ways."",
  ""First of all, trying to provide direct support in a number of directions."",
  ""But also in the same way, we are very, very proud of the contribution made by our employees through their own donations."",
  ""In terms of both logistics and retail, we can tell you that the impact has been very, very limited, right, practically no impact at all."",
  ""Only three stores were affected, and they're back to business."",
  ""So, no significant impact on that."",
  ""The next question comes from Richard Chamberlain from RBC."",
  ""What we can tell about this recent period is that we're very satisfied with the sales."",
  ""You can see that sales growth in constant currency was strong at 10.5%."",
  ""In fact, an acceleration from the previous quarters."",
  ""You will note that the third quarter 2024 saw the strongest sales growth for Inditex in constant currency."",
  ""What is true is that in the currency spectrum, what we are seeing in the third quarter is a particularly negative impact on sales due to a combination of two factors."",
  ""The first one is the strength of the euro versus the majority of currencies and then some specific depreciation in the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso."",
  ""These headwinds appear to be abating in Q4."",
  ""We are now seeing that a stronger US dollar versus the euro and higher stability in the Brazilian real provide more stability to that, and at current exchange rates, we expect a lower currency impact over the fourth quarter."",
  ""For the reason, we're also reiterating our estimate of a currency impact on sales for the year – for the full year that, as Ignacio has mentioned, remains unchanged at minus 3%."",
  ""Regarding the gross margin and the execution, we're very pleased."",
  ""We have flexed the supply chain as usual."",
  ""You see that the gross margin remains stable, and we are reiterating as well our gross margin ambition for the year."",
  ""Costs remain tightly under control."",
  ""So, this has resulted in very high margins in all the different lines of the P&L on sales, and that's very, very clear if you analyze that versus historical levels."",
  ""So, we continue generating strong free cash flow."",
  ""We continue to reinvest into the business."",
  ""And what we can tell you is that we continue to see very strong opportunities for growth."",
  ""The next question comes from Warwick Okines from BNP Exane."",
  ""Well, what we have mentioned in the presentation is that both store sales and online sales keep on growing."",
  ""As you imagine, the secular trends of online growing slightly above stores remains in place."",
  ""Last year, if you remember, online sales were 24% of total, and you should expect this very natural growth in both lines."",
  ""In fact, one of the differentiating factors of Inditex is this fully integrated model that allows us to grow satisfactorily in both channels."",
  ""So, we can tell you that the sales growth that we had during these first nine months is very satisfactory both in stores and online."",
  ""The next question comes from Monique Pollard from Citi."",
  ""I think – , Monique."",
  ""My view on this is obviously supported by the numbers, is we see a lot of opportunities in all the different segments in which we operate."",
  ""I will not just highlight one."",
  ""In fact, I think that what is quite relevant is that in this fourth quarter, we're seeing – we have released our trading update of a 9% growth from the 1st of November to the 9th of December."",
  ""We believe this is a remarkable number, because in the same period last year, our comparable was plus 14% in constant currency."",
  ""So, I would not highlight any specific segment of the market as – in any specific way."",
  ""I think we're making good progress in all of them."",
  ""We're happy with the performance of Zara, of course, with the performance of the concepts."",
  ""And we have mentioned that we're growing also in stores and online."",
  ""So, nothing specific over the recent quarter or recent trends."",
  ""We continue to see opportunities in all our businesses."",
  ""The next question comes from James Grzinic from Jefferies."",
  ""Well, in terms of operating expenses, they remain very much under control."",
  ""You see that as we have a strong focus to have operating expenses growing below sales growth."",
  ""There is a significant variable component in the personnel expenses as well relating to sales."",
  ""We all have part of our remuneration based on the performance – different targets of the company."",
  ""So, we're not seeing anything specific regarding wage growth for next year versus this year."",
  ""That concludes the Q&A session."",
  ""We can now move over to the webcast questions, the first of which is what is the strategy behind the new standalone Zara Man stores and The Apartment concept?"",
  ""Are you targeting a new type of customer?"",
  ""Given we are – given that we are nine months through the year, can you comment a little bit on the evolution of CapEx or space growth, please?"",
  ""That concludes the webcast questions for today.""

  ""As we conclude our fiscal year, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the strides we've made to transform our business and strengthen our foundation for future growth."",
  ""Looking back over the last 12 months, I'm proud of what our team has accomplished."",
  ""We've made significant progress in streamlining our business with a specific emphasis on optimizing our operations, and delivering positive operating cash flow across all segments, even amid a strong secular downturn."",
  ""While overall revenue was down 11% year-over-year in fiscal year 2024, we delivered $4 million of adjusted EBITDA profit compared to $1.8 million in fiscal year 2023."",
  ""Contributing to this result, earlier this year, we implemented a comprehensive restructuring plan, which included organizational adjustments, cost reductions and operational enhancements."",
  ""These efforts have translated into $7 million of annualized operating savings, making our business both more efficient and enabling us to mitigate the existing market dynamics more effectively."",
  ""As a part of this initiative in early 2024, we took the strategic action to streamline our product portfolio by exiting from the unprofitable legacy equipment business at PR Hoffman, and investing in our more profitable and growing consumables business."",
  ""This shift has paid off as sales of the consumable products at PR Hoffman surged by 28% year-over-year despite overall revenue growth of just 2%."",
  ""Within our BTU business, with a sharp decline in demand for equipment, we've accelerated our shift to a hybrid manufacturing model, combining in-house production with outsourced capabilities."",
  ""In addition to strengthening our supply chain, this initiative has allowed us to manage lead times, reduce capital expenditures, and enhance our operational flexibility."",
  ""From a cost savings perspective, while these efforts remain ongoing, by the middle of the next fiscal year, we expect to realize approximately $2 million in additional operational savings above the $7 million we have previously discussed."",
  ""Beyond the core operations of our business in response to the escalating input costs we faced over the past several years, we strategically adjusted pricing across our offerings, helping ensure we protect our margins while maintaining our competitiveness."",
  ""Combined, despite continued weakness in the market, we managed to maintain positive adjusted EBITDA and reduced working capital to pay off our debt and end the year with a cash balance in excess of $11 million."",
  ""Most of our efforts in 2024 focused on optimizing our business to improve profitability."",
  ""As we begin our 2025 fiscal year, we are now focusing much more of our attention on driving sustainable long-term growth with reoccurring revenue streams, such as consumables, parts and services."",
  ""We believe these revenue streams will strengthen our financial performance in the years ahead by providing higher margins with less cyclical revenue growth."",
  ""To accelerate the growth in these areas of focus, we recently invested in both business leadership and marketing resources."",
  ""In addition, as we close our fiscal year, we have renamed our business segments to better align with the markets we serve."",
  ""Our semiconductor fabrication solutions business, previously known as Material and Substrate segment will now focus on growing our consumables parts and service offerings for semiconductor wafer and device fabrication."",
  ""Meanwhile, our thermal processing solutions business, formerly the semiconductor segment will focus on capital equipment for advanced packaging with an emphasis on applications that support AI data centers and on continuing to grow our parts and services businesses."",
  ""Market demand challenges persist in semiconductor segments that are not associated with AI infrastructure."",
  ""Our consumables parts and services business did experience some growth in 2024 even with the broad market headwinds, but could not overcome the strong headwinds from very weak demand in equipment in areas that were not associated with AI infrastructure."",
  ""Timing for a broader market recovery remains uncertain, but we are well positioned to deliver strong operating results when demand recovers."",
  ""In conclusion, we are quite proud of the progress we've made this year."",
  ""Through our strategic actions to optimize our operations, reduce costs and strengthen our balance sheet, we've set ourselves up for more profitable and sustainable growth as markets recover."",
  ""We are now focused on fully capitalizing on the emerging opportunities in AI infrastructure and expanding our reoccurring revenue streams to drive margin improvement and accelerate growth."",
  ""To the current macro – although the current macroeconomic environment is challenging, we are optimistic that our ongoing transformation will deliver profitable growth with high returns on invested capital so we can create meaningful shareholder value."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it over to Wade for further details on our financial results."",
  ""With me on the call today are Bob Daigle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Wade Jenke, Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""After close of market today, Amtech released its financial results for the fiscal fourth quarter and full year of 2024."",
  ""The  is posted on the company's website at www.amtechsystems.com in the Investors section."",
  ""Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that the Safe Harbor disclaimer in our public filings covers this call and the webcast."",
  ""Some of the comments to be made during today's call will contain forward-looking statements and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, those contained in our SEC filings, all of which are posted within the Investors section of our corporate website."",
  ""The company assumes no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements."",
  ""You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today."",
  ""These statements are not a guarantee of future performance and actual results could differ materially from expectations."",
  ""Among the important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, are changes in the technologies used by customers and competitors; change in volatility and the demand for products; the effect of changing worldwide political and economic conditions, including trade sanctions; the effect of overall market conditions, including the equity and credit markets and market acceptance risks; ongoing logistics, supply chain and labor challenges; and capital allocation plans."",
  ""Other risk factors are detailed in our SEC filings, including our Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. Additionally, in today's conference call, we will be referring to non-GAAP financial measures as we discuss the fourth quarter financial and year-end results."",
  ""You'll find a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures to our actual GAAP results included in the press release issued today."",
  ""I would now like to turn the call over to Amtech's Chief Executive Officer, Bob Daigle."",
  ""Net revenues for the fourth quarter decreased 10% sequentially and decreased 13% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023."",
  ""The sequential decrease is primarily due to lower sales of our diffusion furnaces, reflow and wafer cleaning equipment, partially offset by higher consumable parts and service revenue."",
  ""The decrease from the prior year is primarily attributable to lower sales across most of our product portfolio due to the slowdown in the broader semiconductor market."",
  ""In the fourth quarter of our fiscal 2024 period, our GAAP gross margin increased by $7 million compared to the same prior year period."",
  ""This is driven by better margin profiles, product mix and cost saves this year while in the fourth quarter of 2023, we had a $4.6 million intangible asset impairment charge and the $1.5 million write-down of inventory related to the polishing equipment line."",
  ""On a sequential basis, GAAP gross margins in our thermal processing solutions segment was positively affected by product mix attributed to increased revenue for parts and services as well as improved material costs."",
  ""GAAP gross margin in our semiconductor fabrication Solutions segment slightly decreased on a sequential basis due primarily to less favorable product mix on consumables and equipment."",
  ""Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by approximately $0.6 million on a sequential basis and decreased $2.3 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2023."",
  ""The sequential increase is due primarily to increased consulting, audit and IT expenses."",
  ""Compared to the same prior year quarter, the decrease is driven by the $0.5 million intangible asset impairment charge and lower labor and labor-related expenses as a result of our cost reduction initiatives as well as lower shipping on expenses and lower revenues."",
  ""Research and development and engineering expenses increased by $0.3 million sequentially and decreased $1.6 million compared to the prior year fourth quarter."",
  ""With the sequential decrease due primarily to the timing of purchases related to specific projects in both segments, and the decrease from prior year fourth quarter was attributable to development efforts in our semiconductor fabrication solutions segment that did not reoccur."",
  ""GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $0.5 million or $0.04 per share."",
  ""This compares to GAAP net income of $0.4 million or $0.03 per share for the preceding quarter and a GAAP net loss of $12 million or $0.85 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023."",
  ""Non-GAAP net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 was $7,000 or $0.00 per share."",
  ""This compares to non-GAAP net income of $1.1 million or $0.08 per share for the preceding quarter and non-GAAP net loss of $2.5 million or $0.18 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023."",
  ""For cash, unrestricted cash and cash equivalents at September 30, 2024, were $11.1 million compared to $13.1 million at September 30, 2023."",
  ""Debt payments during the three months ended were $4 million, which included the final payment of our term loan and revolving credit facility."",
  ""Net cash as of September 30, 2024, was $10.8 million compared to $2.4 million as of September 30, 2023."",
  ""Now turning to our outlook."",
  ""For the first fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2024, we expect revenues in the range of $21 million to $24 million with adjusted EBITDA nominally neutral."",
  ""The near-term outlook for revenue and earnings remains challenging."",
  ""The actions we took in fiscal 2024 will reduce Amtech's structural cost by approximately $7 million annually."",
  ""Also by mid next fiscal year, we expect to realize an additional $2 million in operational savings from our outsourcing to contract manufacturing."",
  ""We are focused on optimizing our operations and delivering positive operating cash flows across all our segments, even amid a prolonged secular downturn."",
  ""Operating results can significantly be impacted positively or negatively by the timing of orders, system shipments, logistical challenges and the financial results of semiconductor manufacturers."",
  ""Additionally, the semiconductor equipment industries can be cyclical and inherently impacted by changes in market demand."",
  ""Actual results may differ materially in the weeks and months ahead."",
  ""A portion of Amtech's results is denominated in RMBs, a Chinese currency."",
  ""The outlook provided is based on an assumed exchange rate between the United States dollar and the RMB."",
  ""Changes in the value of the RMB in relation to the United States dollar could cause actual results to differ from expectations."",
  ""I will now turn over the call to the operator for questions.""
]","[
  ""First, I should say, congratulations on the really good execution, bringing down costs, tightening everything up in this environment that we're all operating through."",
  ""My question is this, and it's a little bit high level, but you're renaming your segments, right?"",
  ""And that speaks for a refreshed and renewed strategic focus."",
  ""Can you maybe call out some of the applications or opportunities where you think Amtech can participate in sort of AI and data center growth and electricity demand growth over the next several years."",
  ""What do you see as relatively fresh products that you have to offer into this market?"",
  ""And how do you expect this to take shape as far as visibility for the investment community?"",
  ""It goes a long way to answering the question."",
  ""It actually starts to step into the secondary I really wanted to ask about."",
  ""So many of us following Amtech for the last number of years have been quite excited about the participation in the silicon carbide industry, the emerging power semiconductor technology can be transformational to our economy, not just in electric vehicles, but in industrial equipment, military equipment, all sorts of things."",
  ""And it appeared that Amtech was particularly well positioned on the consumables side to serve a niche in sort of consumables for wafer production."",
  ""Can you maybe share with us your growth in the consumables business."",
  ""Did you see absolute growth in cassettes and other materials supplied into the silicon carbon industry."",
  ""That industry is going through a cyclical readjustment as you pointed out."",
  ""There is absolute growth going on and are you seeing more growth in things like cassettes for 8-inch wafers and 6-inch wafers."",
  ""Can you just talk about where the green shoots are in that industry?"",
  ""Well,  for taking my questions."",
  ""I'll go ahead and hop back in the queue."",
  ""I'd like to add my congratulations to the management, the cost management and the expectations for more cost reductions next year."",
  ""I was just thinking – I'm just trying to understand your cash went down $2 million last quarter."",
  ""What is your outlook for cash flow generation over the next six months?"",
  ""So there's no more covenants or anything you have to worry about because you paid off your term loan and revolver."",
  ""You were saying there was mix."",
  ""I'm just wondering, margin outlook ticked up, is the highest of the year for the fourth quarter."",
  ""I'm just wondering what you're thinking about in terms of margin outlook."",
  ""R&D ticked up last quarter?"",
  ""Do you expect that to come back down in the third quarter for – in terms of average for 2025?"",
  ""Can you tell me – relate what that is, please?"",
  ""So let me start again at the high level."",
  ""There were a couple of reasons for really revisiting our segment definitions."",
  ""And some of it was, to be frank, I thought it was a little bit confusing."",
  ""I think some of what we referred to as the semiconductor segment goes back to the days where Amtech was heavily involved with solar."",
  ""So it was either a solar business or semi."",
  ""And when I – looking at the portfolio, a lot of what – when I look at our business, we really have the semiconductor front end of our business, which is really involved in actual semiconductor device fabrication, which is again what will be – and it's broader than just materials and substrates."",
  ""A lot of what we do there is involved services and parts for that part of the business."",
  ""And then what we've been referring to as the semiconductor segment is really back-end packaging and assembly of the electronics."",
  ""So again, it was trying to clean this up and get clearer definition about we have the front end of our business, which is semi fab related, and then we have the back end, which is packaging and assembly and trying to get some clarity around that."",
  ""Now then back to the strategic question of where do we grow, obviously, AI, everybody has been targeting AI as a growth driver for their business."",
  ""We have been playing there."",
  ""Primarily on the back end, our reflow equipment, for example, is used extensively in terms of the advanced packaging applications for semiconductor production."",
  ""We are also looking, however, at opportunities that are adjacent that would relate a little bit – it's more on the consumables side where we are working in its early stage with some customers that have some unique solutions for packaging and in particular, thermal management, which has been talked a lot about in terms of the challenges with these – the more advanced AI chips, how much heat they're generating."",
  ""We are involved and have been involved in the – with consumables at the front end with one of our customers that's heavily focused on trying to solve those problems."",
  ""So I see that as an opportunity really to broaden what we're doing in an area of AI beyond just the back-end equipment but also in the consumables area."",
  ""But stepping back even further from that, I see the consumables parts and service business, which as we noted in the call, even with a very challenging industry dynamics."",
  ""We were able to grow our consumables parts and service business, although less than we would have obviously liked, we did see growth."",
  ""All of our decline – more than all our decline was driven by weakness in the equipment sector."",
  ""So when I look ahead, what I want to see is transform Amtech into much more of a consumables parts service business."",
  ""Not that equipment areas, especially AI related, are very much of interest, but I do see those areas as driving our margins and driving growth opportunities."",
  ""And as we mentioned in the script, that's really where we're investing."",
  ""We've brought on – we're bringing talent on board."",
  ""I'll characterize – we were very, very fragmented in what we're now calling semiconductor fabrication solutions."",
  ""We were really managing those as three tiny businesses, and they're now under single leadership with shared commercial resources in marketing and sales."",
  ""We will also share in the areas of – for product development as we move forward."",
  ""So I see the investments in those areas where, frankly, we've been pretty passive, but I think there's plenty of opportunity, I believe, for us to proactively grow that part of the business."",
  ""It will not only, I think, improve our margins, drive growth but will also reduce the cyclicality that is inherent to any business that's heavily reliant on equipment sales."",
  ""Don't know if that answered your question, Craig, or if you'd like me to elaborate on anything, happy to add color."",
  ""So again, yes, we've participated pretty broadly in and continue to do so in silicon carbide wafer production with our consumables out of PR Hoffman and as I mentioned, we saw a very substantial year-over-year growth in that PR Hoffman part of the business."",
  ""28% actually year-over-year in the consumables out of PR Hoffman."",
  ""A lot of that was related to silicon carbide."",
  ""So again, I think the luster on EV has dimmed a bit, and there's been some inventory corrections going on."",
  ""So at least – and this is purely opinion, Craig, but I do believe where people were expecting 30%, 40% market growth, EV related."",
  ""We're likely to see something that's more in the, let's say, normalized 15%, 20%, still very substantial growth."",
  ""But I think the wildcard in all of this is there's been so much investment in silicon carbide globally, and it's continuing, especially in Mainland China that there's a lot of effort right now, frankly, in expanding the application base for silicon carbide."",
  ""So I think the expectations for silicon carbide growth where maybe people were saying 30%, 40% tied directly to EV have been somewhat tempered."",
  ""I'm not so sure we're not going to see growth rates that approach those levels with the combination of what was going to be EV and these other application areas that everybody is focused on for expanding their base."",
  ""So I'm still very optimistic, frankly, around the EV – the silicon carbide growth driver for us."",
  ""It's a very attractive market application area."",
  ""The enthusiasm is tempered around EV, but that may – that I think will get offset at least to some degree by other applications."",
  ""Just note, Mark, we paid off."",
  ""So the reason cash went down as we've paid off the rest of our debt, right?"",
  ""We want to be debt-free."",
  ""So we basically paid off $4 million, and we're done, we're done, no more debt right now."",
  ""And frankly, again, that was our focus, right, get the operations to be cash flow positive even during the downturn, be aggressive on working capital, get rid of the debt."",
  ""Again, we – big believer, we are going to control our own destiny on costs."",
  ""We're going to control our own destiny in the medium, long term by our growth initiatives that don't just – not just be reliant on market recovery, but look at expanding our business."",
  ""And also, obviously, it will be nice, it will be nice when the market actually does recover, which it will."",
  ""I just don't know when that will be."",
  ""So a lot of the restructuring we did, Mark, was really aimed at that, right, is at similar volume revenue numbers, similar mix being in that 40-ish or better?"",
  ""And then hopefully, with again, revenue should help that."",
  ""Well,  for joining our conference call today, and I'm looking forward to updating everybody on the progress we're making in the months to come."",
  ""So our cash flow generation will be partially fueled by our operation activities as we reduce inventory."",
  ""And then, of course, our positive EBITDA in the future quarters."",
  ""We paid off around $4 million."",
  ""So for our margin outlook, given the guidance for Q1 coming into fiscal year 2025 is going to be slightly close just under that Q4 performance, given what we're shipping out that quarter."",
  ""But going in after that, we expect to be right in that range of 40%."",
  ""When revenue and more volume comes in, we'll get more operating leverage and feed into some of that overhead at that cost of goods sold level and we'll be able to enhance our margins – sorry, part of that contract manufacturing strategy that Amtech has put in place will help yield even more results in the future."",
  ""It was that – do you know R&D this quarter – it was up a little bit – it was a little bit offset from last quarter, honestly, some of our R&D costs pushed out into the Q4 from the Q3."",
  ""So we're going to go pretty much back to our normal run rate if you average the two quarters."",
  ""We should be right around $1 million for the quarter.""

  ""And I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today."",
  ""So today, I'll discuss some highlights from the quarter."",
  ""Mark will then provide a more detailed update on our financials, and I'll return to wrap things up with some remarks about our outlook."",
  ""As expected, MIND delivered strong third quarter results."",
  ""Our business continues to operate efficiently, and our emphasis on cost management and execution is yielding returns."",
  ""Our cash flow from operations again grew during the quarter, which helped improve liquidity."",
  ""We're also pleased to have generated our fourth consecutive quarter of profitable results."",
  ""These results are great indicators of the transformation we've made for building good momentum."",
  ""That's visible in our backlog and pipeline of orders, which I'll elaborate on in a moment."",
  ""Our improved capital structure and encouraging business environment provide MIND with important opportunities that we look to take advantage of in the coming quarters."",
  ""We believe MIND is strategically positioned for growth, improved financial results, and continued profitability in coming periods."",
  ""As I touched on last quarter, the conversion of all preferred stock into common stock was a significant development."",
  ""On the conversion, we issued approximately 6.6 million shares of common stock and now have just under 8 million shares outstanding."",
  ""All outstanding preferred stock along with the associated accrued but undeclared dividends have been retired."",
  ""The impact of this conversion can be seen on our third quarter financials."",
  ""Mark will touch on the accounting for this transaction in just a moment."",
  ""We entered the fourth quarter with a strong backlog of approximately $26 million."",
  ""While the backlog is essentially flat, we made substantial order deliveries during the third quarter that contributed to our improved revenues."",
  ""Yet, we're able to offset this activity with new orders."",
  ""As I previously mentioned, order flow is often sporadic and we don't announce each and every order we receive."",
  ""However, the general trend is one of elevated order flow and activity, and our backlog is much higher than historical standards."",
  ""Beyond that, we have an active pipeline of pending and highly confident orders and prospects."",
  ""They're well in excess of our backlog of received orders."",
  ""We currently estimate this pipeline to be more than double our backlog of firm orders."",
  ""This robust backlog and pipeline of opportunities gives us confidence for improved financial results in the coming periods."",
  ""Three meaningful contributors to our strong backlog are GunLink source controllers, BuoyLink positioning systems, and SeaLink streamer systems."",
  ""Seamap enjoys a strong market position with these products, even a dominant position in some cases."",
  ""We currently have a number of pending orders across these product lines and I'm confident that the favorable market dynamics and our focus will prove to be a recipe for success in generating many more orders in the future."",
  ""As we continue to grow our installed base of products, we also increase our opportunity for aftermarket business, such as spare parts, repairs, and support."",
  ""In the third quarter of this year, approximately 40% of our revenue came from this aftermarket activity."",
  ""Now, as I've done in the past, I must remind you that the timing of the specific orders is subject to variability due to any number of challenges, unforeseen circumstances, or just customer delivery requirements."",
  ""The visibility that our backlog and pipeline gives us has allowed us to better manage supply chain issues."",
  ""In the past year or so, we've been aggressive in acquiring key components for those with long lead times."",
  ""While this has contributed to an increase in inventories, it has allowed us to meet the delivery requirements of our customers and increase revenue."",
  ""We've recently been able to draw down our inventory balances to some degree, expected this trend to continue into the fourth quarter."",
  ""Turning to our results, we, again, were able to grow our revenue both sequentially and year-over-year."",
  ""Marine Technology Products revenues for the third quarter of fiscal 2025 were $12.1 million."",
  ""We continue to capitalize on macro tailwinds and customer engagement to stimulate order flow and generate improved results."",
  ""We're also continually working to improve our execution, efficiency, and cost structure, which we expect to contribute to sustain profitability in future quarters."",
  ""General market conditions within the marine technology space continue to be strong."",
  ""We see a number of opportunities."",
  ""We've continued to field inquiries and respond to requests for accreditations."",
  ""Our team continues to develop new and innovative ways to adapt and implement our technologies to meet the evolving needs of our customers."",
  ""Recent sales and inquiries related to our SeaLink streamer systems were a good example of this."",
  ""The result, we are making additional investments to further develop and advance next generation of our ultra-high resolution SeaLink streamer system."",
  ""I'm confident that our differentiated approach and best-in-class suite of products will continue to give us the competitive advantage to address the growing demand we're seeing within the marine technology industry."",
  ""We continue to see traction for our Spectral Ai software suite."",
  ""Our revenue from this has been de minimis thus far."",
  ""Customer feedback has been very positive."",
  ""There are a number of prospective customers that are being pursued."",
  ""We're also exploring ways in which we can more quickly address an expanded market for this technology."",
  ""And now, for that, I'll let Mark walk you through our third quarter financials in a bit more detail, then I'll come back Okay."",
  ""We're pleased that MIND continues to benefit from significant customer interest and engagement related to our Seamap product lines."",
  ""A robust pipeline of orders and improved visibility gives us confidence for sustained, higher level revenue."",
  ""We've streamlined our operations and focused our efforts in recent years."",
  ""This strategy is yielding positive results."",
  ""We now have a very clean capital structure after the conversion of preferred stock to common stock."",
  ""When combined with our lean operating structure, this provides a great deal of flexibility from which to pursue opportunities."",
  ""However, we also remain dedicated to managing cost to improve margins and enhance our bottom line."",
  ""Now that we are so much better positioned as a company, and the macro environment is advantageous for MIND, I'm excited for us to actively chase new initiatives and opportunities."",
  ""We've developed valuable partnerships and customer relationships that have enabled us to build up a strong backlog and they continue to drive new orders."",
  ""Our Marine Technology Products continue to penetrate a variety of industries and markets."",
  ""We believe our backlog of firm orders and pipeline of pending orders and other prospects are reflective of the significant demand and market adoption of our product lines."",
  ""While we're pleased with our results for the third quarter, we believe MIND is poised to capitalize on additional opportunities and deliver improved results in coming quarters."",
  ""As a result, we expect to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA and profitability as we conclude fiscal 2025 to look ahead to next year."",
  ""Looking forward, we remain encouraged by the current demand environment and customer engagement we're experiencing."",
  ""We expect our results for the fourth quarter to again be improved when compared to the third quarter."",
  ""Additionally, our current visibility, healthy customer engagement, strong backlog, and significant pipeline also give us optimism for fiscal 2026."",
  ""We have a differentiated and market leading suite of products, a favorable market environment and supportive tailwinds."",
  ""Business is also benefiting from improved balance sheet and capital structure, which will be instrumental as we strive for growth."",
  ""We look forward to wrapping up this year on a high note and remain focused on generating improved stockholder value in future periods."",
  ""With that, operator, we now open the call up for some questions."",
  ""We appreciate all of you joining us today."",
  ""With me are Rob Capps, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Cox, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Before I turn the call over to Rob, I have a few items to cover."",
  ""If you would like to listen to a replay of today's call, it will be available for 90 days via webcast by going to the Investor Relations section of the company's website at mind-technology.com or via a recorded instant replay until December 18."",
  ""Information on how to access this replay was provided in yesterday's ."",
  ""Information reported on this call speaks only as of today, Wednesday, December 11, 2024, and therefore, you are advised that time sensitive information may no longer be accurate as of the time of any replay listening or transcript reading."",
  ""Before we begin, let me remind you that certain statements made by management during this call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""These forward-looking statements are based on management's current expectations and include known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which the company is unable to predict or control that may cause the company's actual future results or performance to materially differ from any future results or performance expressed or implied by those statements."",
  ""These risks and uncertainties include the risk factors disclosed by the company from time to time in its filings with the SEC, including in its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2024."",
  ""Furthermore, as we start this call, please also refer to the statement regarding forward-looking statements incorporated in our press release issued yesterday."",
  ""And please note that the contents of our conference call this morning are covered by these statements."",
  ""Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Rob Capps."",
  ""As usual, I'd like to remind you that with the sale of Klein, those operations have been treated as discontinued operations and results for periods prior to the sale on August 2023 have been restated to reflect that."",
  ""Accordingly, the prior period comparative data reported yesterday and discussed here today do not include amounts related to Klein."",
  ""They include only our ongoing business."",
  ""As Rob mentioned earlier, revenues for Marine Technology Products sales totaled approximately $12.1 million in the quarter, which was up about 143% from the same period a year ago, 21% sequentially from our fiscal 2025 second quarter."",
  ""Strength we're seeing in all our key markets and the favorable customer demand environment continues to support our backlog and significant pipeline of highly confident orders, positioning us well for sustained high-level revenue in the coming quarters."",
  ""Third quarter gross profit was approximately $5.4 million, which was about 141% higher when compared to the third quarter of last year and up 13% sequentially."",
  ""Gross profit margin was 45% for the quarter, which was essentially flat with a year ago and down sequentially."",
  ""We implemented various price increases earlier this year and we're benefiting from greater production efficiencies throughout the business that are both meaningfully contributing to overhead absorption and improved margins."",
  ""Our general and administrative expenses were approximately $2.8 million for the third quarter of fiscal 2025, which was flat sequentially, but down compared to a year ago."",
  ""As we highlighted last quarter, these reductions in general and administrative expenses stem mainly from our ability to streamline overhead cost following the sale of Klein."",
  ""Most notably, corporate expenses related to the support of Klein."",
  ""Our research and development expense for the fiscal 2025 third quarter was $562,000."",
  ""Costs are largely directed towards the development of our next-generation streamer system."",
  ""Operating income for the third quarter was approximately $1.9 million, compared to an operating loss of approximately $1.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was approximately $2 million, compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately $1.1 million in the third quarter a year ago."",
  ""Net income for the third quarter was approximately $1.3 million, which was an improvement of approximately $3 million from the net loss of approximately $1.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""As Rob mentioned, we're pleased to have achieved another quarter of profitability, our fourth in a row, and we expect to continue building on this momentum in future periods."",
  ""As of October 31, 2024, we had working capital of approximately $21.2 million, including $3.5 million cash on hand."",
  ""Liquidity continued to be impacted by our operational requirements, such as acquiring inventory and executing on our backlog of orders."",
  ""However, we did generate $1.6 million of cash flow from operations in the third quarter."",
  ""This represented a sequential increase of 84% compared to the second quarter."",
  ""We are debt-free and the company maintains a clean capital structure following the preferred stock conversion in September."",
  ""We now have solid footing and flexibility from which to enhance stockholder value in future periods."",
  ""As we mentioned last quarter, our third quarter results reflect the conversion of the preferred stock into approximately $6.6 million new shares of common stock."",
  ""We recorded this issuance at the market value of the common stock less associated transaction costs, such as legal fees and solicitation costs, and the carrying value of the preferred stock has been eliminated."",
  ""The excess of the carrying value of the preferred stock over the recorded value of the new common stock, which was approximately $15 million, has been credited directly to retained earnings."",
  ""This amount is also included in the calculation of earnings per share attributable to common stockholders, but is not included in net income."",
  ""I'll now pass it back over to Rob for some concluding comments.""
]","[
  ""It seems like we've now entered into the phase of more of the blocking and tackling quarters with a lot of the financial noise behind us, which is obviously a relief to all."",
  ""And we're now starting to build that cash buffer for the company."",
  ""Appears like you should be able to end the year – your fiscal year at about $5 million in cash unless you have some net working capital gains or other uses that could embellish that number going forward."",
  ""With that type of capitalization now in place and building that cash buffer for you, what options does that open up for you, where we were going from survival to now looking at more of a growth phase for the company?"",
  ""Speaking for myself, I'm not sure if the Street or shareholders necessarily want you to go out and do a large acquisition at this point in time."",
  ""Give us a sense – I think one thing that is missing from prospective shareholders and institutions that we talk with is, just the scope of your global installed base."",
  ""When we're talking about seismic fleets and other service providers in the marine side, that part – that services business really is a growing annuity force for your future financials."",
  ""Give us a sense of that global installed base or what that means."",
  ""And because a couple of years ago, the bigger competitor dropped out of the industry, this really is your ball field here."",
  ""In the last quarter, you brought up the concept of leverage versus pricing, helping out margins."",
  ""We saw that leverage on your operating expenses, that additional top-line and holding the operating expenses there."",
  ""The gross margin, a little light, but you have product mix, you have other things that go into there."",
  ""Is that something that we should see a greater influence on that pricing side as your new orders pipeline is fairly robust."",
  ""And with the addition of the leverage on the operating side, we'll see bigger improvements in that EBIT margin."",
  ""And the question we hear a lot of these conference calls, with the new administration coming in, pros and cons, obviously, possible tariffs on one side, deregulation on the other side, which can improve Gulf activity, comments from Pemex, which we've heard various times throughout the past decade, plus that don't necessarily materialize."",
  ""But just your sense within the industry, their outlook in general and how that improves your outlook?"",
  ""This is the time of the year that a lot of your customers are making CapEx decisions for the next calendar year and beyond."",
  ""Would you anticipate more new order flow as we get beyond the first of the year and really early next year, a little pick up in that activity?"",
  ""And last question for me."",
  ""You talked about new generation streamer becoming available."",
  ""Would that be a prelude to more full system sales once that gets available to the industry and your customer base?"",
  ""And would you expect favorable pricing and margins on that new product coming out?"",
  ""First, it's always exhausting to follow Tyson because you're having to spend so much time crossing off your questions."",
  ""First, congratulations on everything you guys have accomplished this year, especially the operational performance, which is really impressive."",
  ""I have not seen a queue yet."",
  ""So is it possible that you give us what the GAAP earnings would be this year or year to date?"",
  ""Obviously, your early GAAP earnings were impacted by a number of other factors."",
  ""These are impacted by some factors, but I'm trying to get a run rate earnings per share number for you sitting at this year."",
  ""That's what I was looking for."",
  ""You said about 40% of revenues, and you and Tyson talked about the aftermarket aspect of your business."",
  ""Is that 40% a number that one should see kind of on an annual basis?"",
  ""I understand, because of the fact that it's kind of used driven, you might have some seasonality or some orders that are higher or lower."",
  ""But is that a reasonably good number overall, or should we expect to see that be somewhat lower or grow higher as you get more product in the field?"",
  ""And I would assume that it doesn't matter how new or old the piece of equipment is."",
  ""It's really how it's being utilized and used, which is what drives the need for it."",
  ""So that even a new piece of equipment can result in aftermarket sales reasonably quickly if it turns out Yeah."",
  ""I can see a lot of things can go wrong with that."",
  ""What are the needs – you talked two things."",
  ""One is, what is the – what areas are driving your sales growth in here?"",
  ""I mean, we – I look at you guys and that we've seen – you have the energy market, you have the defense market, you have the subsea mining market, you have the mapping market."",
  ""You have other markets, looking for Malaysian airliners probably, things of that nature."",
  ""What is it that's actually – what are you seeing or are you seeing new areas of interest out there?"",
  ""And I would think that – one, the UN has a program that wants to map all the world's ocean bottom."",
  ""So I would assume that as that goes forward, that's a market opportunity or a continuing source of demand."",
  ""But also, the growth of drone submarines and the like, it strikes me as there's a lot of need for subsea mapping along with that type of effort, where you – if you're going to program something to go somewhere, you better know that there's not some large rock in the way."",
  ""Is that an area where you're seeing growing interest?"",
  ""Also, you talked about the new products."",
  ""What kind of CapEx or R&D funding needs do you see having for those?"",
  ""And is the cash conversion ratio, which was a little over 13% this year, something we should expect pushing forward?"",
  ""And lastly, I would agree with Tyson's comment that I think at this stage, given all the success and opportunity, I'm not sure I want to see you guys do a big acquisition just yet."",
  ""I'm not saying just manage it, but I'm saying, let us get to understand what the powerful profitability matrix here is, and then we can push forward."",
  ""As I said, you guys are doing a great job."",
  ""I think this is – this has really turned things around business wise."",
  ""It's – to me, quite honestly, when I look at what you talked about, your earnings, you had $3 million in earnings for the year."",
  ""That basically gives you a run rate that's probably north of Tyson's or around or north of Tyson's estimate, which quite honestly even the current You take care."",
  ""Have a great holiday, by the way."",
  ""And  for taking my question."",
  ""I'm a little bit new to the stock, so I started out as a preferred shareholder and Okay."",
  ""My other question, one of the justification for the preferred conversions was mentioned is to – for you to become a more attractive acquisition target based Okay."",
  ""My other question, obviously, is more of a cyclical business, but it is also a growth component."",
  ""So maybe you can break it up a little bit of where you are in the cycle."",
  ""So this seems to be an upswing to the cycle for your products versus which form do you think is going to – you can grow permanently?"",
  ""So, I think it gives us options."",
  ""Before, we didn't have a lot of options, look back a year ago."",
  ""So it gives us the ability to look at different things, how can we expand the product offering, how can we take our technology into different markets."",
  ""So it just gives us that flexibility."",
  ""It also gives us the working capital to maybe pursue some other projects that perhaps we just couldn't before because of the capital requirements of it."",
  ""So it just gives us options."",
  ""Tyson, I don't see us going out and making a big acquisition, and that's not what we're about."",
  ""But what we want to do is to add things that are tangent to what we're doing now and start to slowly build our portfolio and build our revenue base."",
  ""I couldn't live through that."",
  ""I mean, we have equipment installed with every seismic contractor in the world, plus many survey companies in the world."",
  ""This stuff is used in very harsh environments."",
  ""Just the nature of the beast."",
  ""So there is a great deal of opportunity for us to provide spare parts, repairs, fuel service, training for this increasing installed base."",
  ""And that doesn't go away."",
  ""Those guys are out there and they always have to replace things, which is a good – relatively steady flow of business, which I think continue to grow."",
  ""We do that business here in the US, in our Huntsville facility."",
  ""We do it in our Malaysia facility, nearby Singapore."",
  ""We send fuel service people out all over the world to do things on the vessels."",
  ""So it's – we literally are anywhere in the world that you can be."",
  ""Obviously, you can't go to Iran and North Korea and Russia."",
  ""But everywhere else, we are providing on services."",
  ""In some cases, certainly, with source controllers, we are the only game in town."",
  ""Now, that's a niche with an industry share."",
  ""There is some competition in other areas for positioning systems and for streamer systems."",
  ""But again, in the areas in which we're playing, the applications that we're focused on, we think we have a demanding or a leading position, I should say."",
  ""And frankly, have a technological edge over any competition."",
  ""So we think we're very well positioned on that."",
  ""And that's a growing area for us."",
  ""So I think just to give some color on that, I think the operational leverage, we're seeing a lot of that benefit."",
  ""I think just as top line grows, you'll continue to see more of that, but maybe to a lesser degree."",
  ""I think we do have some pricing leverage here."",
  ""A lot of the revenue we delivered this past year was actually quoted the prior year, so almost two years old pricing."",
  ""So, I think we see some opportunities to improve that, maybe be a little more aggressive on our discount structures, and therefore bring some Yeah."",
  ""So I think it's certainly not a negative."",
  ""It's a positive, if anything."",
  ""I think the direct impact, as you mentioned, is probably more permitting issues in the Gulf of Mexico."",
  ""And so yeah, that has positive impact."",
  ""But again, our customers work in all of the world."",
  ""So what this administration does doesn't impact West Africa or off of coast of Brazil, but that is a positive, I think."",
  ""So I think it's a positive but not a huge impact."",
  ""I don't feel – see a direct impact from us."",
  ""I think the other issues you hear about the tariffs and whatnot, I don't see that as an impact for us."",
  ""Again, remember, we're manufacturing and shipping out of Singapore."",
  ""So we're delivering out of Singapore."",
  ""So I really don't see an impact that might come from anything of that nature."",
  ""Yeah, I mean, it's kind of lumpy, as you know."",
  ""And there are a number of prospects that we are in the middle of right now which could come to fruition tomorrow or it could be another month or another two months."",
  ""It just kind of depends when they pull the trigger."",
  ""And part of it is predicated upon what they see their demand being, or do they want a particular project, therefore, that need that they have has a specific timeframe."",
  ""So that's really what drives a lot of this."",
  ""But I'm confident we'll see additional activity, if not later this year, certainly into early next year."",
  ""I mean, I think it's not a – the next two or three months sort of thing."",
  ""It's further down the road a bit."",
  ""But I think it will allow us to, again, address the competition a little more effectively."",
  ""And also, I think it will allow us to perhaps address an expanded market as well."",
  ""Perhaps, there is – there are some installations or applications that we're not best suited for today, but maybe would be with our improved technology."",
  ""So I think that will expand our addressable market."",
  ""Probably not a big impact on 2026, but going forward from there, I think that's where you'll see the benefit."",
  ""So year to date, nine-month income from can – share net income, rather, is $3 million, $3,043,000."",
  ""That's before our dividend activity."",
  ""So that's a great question, because if you look historically, it's been around that level."",
  ""The periods we've looked at."",
  ""That's something we used to track until in the last year or so."",
  ""There's two factors that drive that percentage."",
  ""It's just – it's the math."",
  ""So you got bigger system sales, it's going to drive that percentage down, obviously, or you have higher – actually, absolute sales of that activity is going to drive higher."",
  ""So it's really a function of the two."",
  ""I would expect the absolute amount to continue to increase."",
  ""You got more stuff installed."",
  ""You got more customers out there."",
  ""There's more set to keep maintained."",
  ""And you don't have to resell that either."",
  ""It happens by itself and it tends to have better margins as well, as you might imagine."",
  ""As a matter of fact, most large system deliveries include a spares component."",
  ""So, people buy spares upfront because you know what's going to happen."",
  ""And with this So the big drivers, obviously, still energy exploration has been on a rebound."",
  ""So that certainly is a positive for us."",
  ""But also, marine survey activity is a big driver for us recently, doing ocean bottom surveys for carbon capture installations, for wind farm installations, for all sorts of other stuff."",
  ""So, those are the things that have been driving things most recently."",
  ""I think the other – there are opportunities in other areas, but those two things have been the big drivers so far."",
  ""No, not directly for us."",
  ""What we're doing is providing survey for the subsurface of the ocean bottom to some depth."",
  ""So things that are actually on the surface itself, that's really other technology."",
  ""That's really And also, we still see opportunities to take that technology into other areas, such as domain security, things of that nature, which we've talked about a lot."",
  ""And frankly, that's an area that we've put on the back burner in the last year and a half as we try to focus on current revenue opportunities."",
  ""But I think that's something that we can readdress."",
  ""There certainly are some opportunities there for us going forward."",
  ""I think if you look at what we've been doing this past year, I don't see a big change from that."",
  ""There are some ups and downs from quarter to quarter just based on prototype deliveries and things like that."",
  ""But in general, it's going to be that level of spending."",
  ""Ross, that's a really tough one to nail down."",
  ""I would expect it to improve a bit in the near term."",
  ""That really is dependent on how orders come in and what we have to do about replenishing inventory, is really going to drive that a lot."",
  ""So I'm hesitant to be too precise here, but I would expect to see some improvement, at least in the near term."",
  ""Ross, you're preaching to the choir."",
  ""It's not that unusual at all."",
  ""And that's just got – it varies from period to period, obviously, based on specific orders."",
  ""But I think that's not at all unusual, if you look back historically."",
  ""We've always tracked the number of orders."",
  ""We – we've historically been pretty conservative about what we report."",
  ""So we're only reporting firm orders."",
  ""That's why we give you a sense of – again, the total opportunities that we see out there."",
  ""But I think that's pretty common for us."",
  ""Well, obviously, going private is a difficult thing, especially with a shareholder structure such as ours."",
  ""It's very difficult to do."",
  ""We are – want to drive shareholder value just like you do and everyone else does."",
  ""So there are opportunities for us to combine with someone else in some manner."",
  ""We were certainly open to looking at those sort of things."",
  ""But we're going to concentrate on growing the business at the same time because you can't force those things to happen."",
  ""They happen when they happen."",
  ""You just have to run the business and that's what we're trying to do now."",
  ""That's the answer to your question."",
  ""I think the streamer business, the SeaLink business probably has the most upside near term just because that's been a smaller part for us."",
  ""But having said that, I think we continue to see opportunities for our source controller business for GunLink, even though we have a dominant market position there."",
  ""We see opportunity to deliver improved technology."",
  ""So replace existing installations, things of that nature."",
  ""So I think I see opportunity in – across all areas."",
  ""I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today and we look forward to talking to you when we report our fourth quarter and year-end earnings early in the new year.""

32,3141028,0N7974-E,2024-12-11,"[
  ""Welcome, everyone, to our third quarter conference call."",
  ""This was another quarter of solid execution for Cognyte."",
  ""We continued to deliver on our business plan, advanced our growth initiatives and driving improved profitability."",
  ""The market for our solutions remain robust and is evolving as anticipated, driving predictable and sustainable growth."",
  ""Our execution resulted in another quarter of double-digit revenue growth with adjusted EBITDA expanding more rapidly than revenue."",
  ""Our year-to-date performance, combined with solid visibility and sustained demand, reinforces our confidence in the business."",
  ""As a result, we are pleased to again raise our full year outlook."",
  ""During Q3, we grew revenue by 12% year-over-year to $89 million."",
  ""Non-GAAP gross profit increased by 12% year-over-year."",
  ""We generated approximately $7 million of positive adjusted EBITDA for the quarter representing 42% year-over-year growth, highlighting the strength of our financial model."",
  ""And we believe our momentum remains strong, fueled by significant deal wins during the quarter."",
  ""These results and deal wins validate the strength of our technology, the differentiated value we provide to our customers and the substantial opportunities that we believe lie ahead."",
  ""A key pillar of our growth strategy is deepening and broadening engagements with our existing customers."",
  ""We achieved this by increasing the number of groups and the number of users, leveraging our solutions and by offering additional capabilities to address emerging threats and evolving priorities."",
  ""One of the trends that is driving expansions is enabling our customers to handle rapidly growing volume and variety of data they need to analyze."",
  ""An example is the explosion in mobile data driven by the transition to 5G, which has significantly increased the complexity and scale of their challenges."",
  ""According to a report recently issued by Ericsson, mobile data traffic is growing at an annual rate exceeding 20%."",
  ""This surge in data volumes and diversity underscores the need for advanced analytics, including AI-powered solutions to extract actionable and timely insights from the expanding data landscape."",
  ""By delivering the solutions that address these needs, we strengthen our customers' relationships and drive sustained demand."",
  ""In Q3, we secured four significant orders from existing customers."",
  ""Two deals that valued at more than $20 million, the other two were valued at over $10 million."",
  ""We issued press releases announcing these notable deals over the past two weeks."",
  ""These longstanding customers have consistently drove substantial value for our solutions over the years."",
  ""We believe this demonstrates this indispensable role our solutions play in addressing our customers evolving challenges, delivering the quality, reliability and power such customers require to operate effectively in complex environments."",
  ""We continue to expand our customer base signing nine new customers this quarter alone."",
  ""This includes five contracts valued at over $1 million each and one significant contract worth $5 million."",
  ""These new customers span across different regions and segments, highlighting the broad opportunity in the market."",
  ""Additional wins in North America underscores our steady progress in establishing our foothold in this market."",
  ""A few weeks ago, we announced a follow-on order valued at over $2 million from a highly respected and influential North American law enforcement agency."",
  ""This agency initially selected our solution in just over a year ago to replace their incumbent provider solution."",
  ""Since then, the agency has recognized the superior operational intelligence value our solutions delivered."",
  ""With this latest order, the customer's total investment exceeds $3 million, highlighting their trust in Cognyte and in our solutions' ability to meet their critical operational needs."",
  ""We anticipate that future potential North American customers will likely follow a similar trajectory starting with smaller initial orders and expanding the investments over time as they realize measurable improvements in efficiency and outcomes."",
  ""We continue to actively pursue opportunities in North American federal market."",
  ""Federal customers explore and rigorously test potential new solutions for long periods of time to validate their effectiveness before making the purchase."",
  ""As a result, the sales cycle with these customers is expected to be longer than what we've experienced with state and local law enforcement agencies."",
  ""Nonetheless, we are pleased with the level of engagement we have with these potential customers in this important market segment."",
  ""To further strengthen our efforts in the US, we recently welcomed Timothy O'Callaghan, a retired US Marshal Branch Chief, to help lead our initiatives aimed at expanding our presence."",
  ""His extensive experience and deep understanding of operations will be invaluable as we build our momentum in this market."",
  ""We continuously engage with our customers around the globe to understand better and help them address their challenges."",
  ""Recently, we hosted our Global Cognyte Intelligence Summit in Europe, a landmark event where we introduced our latest AI-powered innovations."",
  ""Over 300 attendees from about 70 countries representing law enforcement, national intelligence and national security agencies explored today's critical security challenges and their transformative role of our technology."",
  ""The event featured a keynote by retired Admiral Mike Rogers, Former Commander of the United States Cyber Command, Director of the NSA and Chief of the Central Security Service were shared the insights into the intersection of intelligence and technology."",
  ""The Admiral underscored the challenges agencies face are not getting any easier."",
  ""However, adversaries must engage with the broader environment."",
  ""They need to communicate, they need to move, and they need to access and transfer money."",
  ""He highlighted that with the right technology, these interactions present opportunities."",
  ""And this is where Cognyte's advantage lies, leveraging technology to transform these interactions into actionable intelligence."",
  ""He also noted, agencies work to generate deep knowledge about the environment and operational landscape, transforming information into actionable outcomes."",
  ""He emphasized two things, excelling in addressing the present challenges while proactively positioning themselves for future success with the right tools and technology."",
  ""These are the exact principles that we use to align our focus in product development, advanced tools for actionable insights and future readiness."",
  ""At the summit, we also hosted 10 external speakers, including former heads of agencies, counter-terrorism experts and representatives from global think-tanks, both reinforcing our position as a thought leader and fostering discussions on the evolving threat landscape."",
  ""The key insights from the summit underscores how the world's challenges are becoming more complex and Bad actors exploit advanced technologies like encrypted communications, dark web networks and cryptocurrency to evade detection."",
  ""Increasingly, they are leveraging AI to exclude operations, creating unprecedented challenges for security agencies This quarter I want to highlight how our technology addresses the critical challenges posed by organized crime."",
  ""Agencies serving the task of identifying members of criminal organization and mapping their networks, including leadership structures, funding sources and intentions."",
  ""Despite our efforts to conceal activities, these group inevitably leave behind valuable digital footprints."",
  ""However, as the volume and diversity of digital information grow exponentially, extracting actionable insights becomes increasingly complex."",
  ""This is where leveraging of advanced technology is no longer optional, it is essential."",
  ""With the right solutions like ours, agencies can efficiently analyze vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, uncover hidden connections and accelerate investigations to achieve successful outcomes."",
  ""To illustrate, a few months ago in Central America, our solutions enabled authorities to dismantle one of their continent's largest drug trafficking network."",
  ""By providing the right insights at the right time security agencies intercepted seven tons of cocaine off the coast."",
  ""This example demonstrates the decisive impact our solutions have in combating organized crime on a global scale."",
  ""We are making a meaningful difference to our customers, empowering them to address significant and evolving threats."",
  ""Our mission to make the world a safer place drives everything we do."",
  ""By combining cutting edge technology with proven methodologies, we enable faster decision making, accelerate investigations and help mitigate a wide range of threats."",
  ""This is why customers around the globe continue to place their trust in our solutions."",
  ""In summary, we continue to grow by introducing new advanced capabilities deepening our relationships with existing customers as well as expanding our reach with new ones."",
  ""These accomplishments strengthen our ability to deliver growth."",
  ""With solid execution during the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, we are once again in a position to raise our full year outlook for revenue and adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""We now expect revenue to be approximately $349 million, plus or minus 1%, representing about 11% year-over-year growth at the midpoint of the range."",
  ""Given the leverage in our financial model, we increased our adjusted EBITDA guidance and we now expect it to be about $26 million at the midpoint of the revenue range almost 3 times what we generated in fiscal 2024."",
  ""Looking beyond this year, our focus remains on driving resilient growth for the long-term increased profitability, operational excellence and deepening our market leadership."",
  ""We believe that our strategy positions us well to capitalize on the Now, let me turn the call over to David to provide more details about our Q3 results and updated fiscal 2025 outlook."",
  ""I'm Dean Ridlon, Cognyte's Head of Investor Relations."",

  ""Total software revenue, which include software and software services, was $75.3 million, an increase of $3.7 million compared to last year, representing about 85% of total revenue."",
  ""It is noteworthy that approximately 40% of total software revenue growth came from incremental subscription revenue, underscoring the strength of our strong recurring revenue base."",
  ""Recurring revenue remains a key strength and was $46.9 million or 53% of total revenue in Q3, compared to $42 million in the same period last year."",
  ""Recurring revenue comprised primarily of support contracts and some subscription offering is a cornerstone of our business."",
  ""It provides strong visibility and support long-term growth."",
  ""Professional services revenue was $13.7 million, an increase of $5.9 million over last year."",
  ""Professional services as a percentage of revenue in Q3 was high due to the timing of revenue recognition."",
  ""We expect that its share on an annual basis will be lower and blend at about 30% of total revenue."",
  ""Later on this call, I will provide additional insight into our different revenue streams and our FY 2025 revenue mix outlook."",
  ""Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70.1%."",
  ""Our total non-GAAP software gross margin improved to 80.3% versus 78.9% last year, a year-over-year improvement of 114 basis points."",
  ""Our non-GAAP professional services gross margin was 14.4% versus negative 9.7% last year."",
  ""Our strong gross margin highlights the value and competitive differentiation of our solutions as well as the benefit of an optimized cost structure."",
  ""Non-GAAP operating income and adjusted EBITDA grew faster than revenue, reflecting the strength of our financial model."",
  ""In Q3, we generated $3.4 million of non-GAAP operating income, an increase of 180% versus last year and $6.6 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of about 42% versus last year, resulting in positive non-GAAP EPS of $0.02."",
  ""Looking at our year-to-date results, our revenue was $256.1 million, up 11.5% year-over-year with non-GAAP gross profit growing 13.9% outpacing revenue growth."",
  ""Software revenue year-to-date was $88.4 million, an increase of 7.6% versus last year."",
  ""Software services revenue year-to-date was $135 million, an increase of 10% versus last year about 30% of total software revenue growth of $18.5 million or 9% was driven by incremental subscription revenue supporting our recurring revenue growth."",
  ""Professional services and other revenue year-to-date was $32.8 million, an increase of 31.7% versus last year."",
  ""Total software revenue was 87% of our revenue during the first nine months of the year."",
  ""The inherent leverage in our business model drove significant year-over-year improvement in profitability, underscoring our ability to scale efficiently while delivering strong financial results."",
  ""Our year-to-date non-GAAP operating income was $9.7 million, an improvement of $14.9 million compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $5.2 million during the first nine months of last fiscal year."",
  ""Similarly, our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA was $19.9 million, an increase of $15.2 million compared to $4.7 million in the same period of the previous year."",
  ""The strong performance this year, combined with the leverage inherent in our business model has enabled us to strengthen our balance sheet."",
  ""Our short and long term contract liabilities commonly referred to as deferred revenue remained robust at $132.2 million at the end of Q3, reflecting a significant increase versus previous periods driven by strong billings performance during the quarter."",
  ""Our cash position remains strong at $107.3 million, an increase of over $24 million since year end with no debt."",
  ""This growth in our cash balance was primarily fueled by cash flow from operations during the first nine months of the year."",
  ""During Q3, we generated $12.3 million in cash from operations and $7.6 million in free cash flow, reflecting the strength of our financial model and operational efficiency."",
  ""Over the past few quarters, we have introduced new KPI to provide greater transparency and demonstrate how our business is progressing."",
  ""Let me walk you through our performance against each of these key indicators."",
  ""RPO or remaining performance obligations, which represents contracted revenue to be recognized in future periods are influenced by factors such as sales cycle, deployment timelines, contract length, renewal timing and seasonality."",
  ""Total RPO is the sum of deferred revenue of $132.2 million and backlog of $435.4 million."",
  ""At the end of Q3, total RPO was $567.6 million, consistent with previous quarter."",
  ""Long term RPO, which also include multiyear support contracts is expected to continue to fluctuate due to renewal timing, During Q3, we secured several significant deals and achieved key billings milestones, resulting in billings of $104.7 million, significantly higher than our revenue for the quarter."",
  ""This strong performance reflects the impact of both ongoing business and a few larger deals that may not occur every quarter, making this figure higher than what might typically be expected."",
  ""Billings are calculated as revenue plus the change in contract liabilities, contract assets and unbilled balances."",
  ""This strong billing performance contributed to an increase in deferred revenue, which stood at $132.2 million at the end of the quarter, further strengthening our financial foundation and revenue visibility."",
  ""Our non-GAAP gross profit for the quarter was $62.4 million, an increase of $6.7 million or 12% year-over-year."",
  ""Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses were $59 million aligned with our expectations."",
  ""A combination of revenue growth, improved margins and effective cost structure drove a notable increase in profitability."",
  ""During Q3, we achieved $6.6 million of adjusted EBITDA and $3.4 million in non-GAAP operating income."",
  ""We remained focused on driving further incremental improvements and continuing to expand our margins."",
  ""Before I turn to our improved FY 2025 outlook, I want to provide additional insight into our revenue stream."",
  ""We generate revenue from three main streams."",
  ""Software revenue is primarily perpetual licenses and appliances with some term licenses subscription."",
  ""Software services, which is largely support contracts and to a lesser extent cloud-based SaaS subscription offering."",
  ""And professional services and other revenue reflecting mainly deployment, development, hardware selling and training."",
  ""All revenue streams can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter, mainly due to timing of revenue recognition related to customer readiness and percentage of completion accounting."",
  ""In addition, the signing of new or renewed support or subscription contract may impact revenue recognition timing."",
  ""We manage and evaluate the business by focusing on total software revenue, which combines software and software services."",
  ""This holistic approach reflects the value we deliver through our technology and the services that support and enhance its adoption."",
  ""This metric better reflects sales performance as it capture the full revenue contribution from the customer."",
  ""It includes perpetual licenses, appliances and subscription as well as support contracts."",
  ""On an annual basis, we expect total software revenue to continue to be a growth driver."",
  ""Professional services revenue, which we target to be in the low teens as a percentage of total revenue is crucial."",
  ""These services help customers extract greater value from our solutions and enable them to operationalize more quickly, ultimately driving additional opportunities with those customers."",
  ""It is important to point out, the professional services revenue varies quarter-to-quarter due to several factors, including the timing and the scale of deployments."",
  ""These fluctuations are natural and we look at the overall share of professional services revenue on an annual basis to ensure it aligns with our strategic and financial goals."",
  ""Based on our strong year-to-date performance and favorable market conditions, we are raising our full year outlook for fiscal 2025."",
  ""We now expect full year revenue to be approximately $349 million, plus or minus 1%, representing year-over-year growth of approximately 11% at the midpoint of the range."",
  ""Out of this revenue outlook, we expect total software revenue to be about $304 million, representing approximately 87% of total revenue."",
  ""And professional services revenue to represent about 13% of total revenue aligned with our strategic goals."",
  ""We now expect adjusted EBITDA to be about $26 million at the midpoint of the revenue range, up from $9 million last year, reflecting the inherent leverage in our business model."",
  ""We have made progress with our strategic tax planning and now expect non-GAAP tax expenses to be about $6 million, an improvement from our initial estimate of $10 million."",
  ""With this updated improved outlook, we now project annual non-GAAP EPS to be positive $0.05 at the midpoint of revenue range."",
  ""Finally, we continue to expect to generate about $37 million of cash from operations for this year, reflecting the strong cash generating capability of our business."",
  ""In November, our Board of Directors approved a share buyback program of up to $20 million in ordinary shares over the next 18 months reaffirming our commitment to delivering value to shareholders."",
  ""Following the required 30-day notice period under the Israeli Law share repurchases can begin on Friday, December 15."",
  ""To summarize, we have demonstrated consistent execution, delivering strong result for the first nine months of the year."",
  ""Our ongoing commitment to innovation and expanding our advanced solutions, leveraging the latest technologies including AI continues to enhance the value we provide for customers."",
  ""Reflecting this progress, we have again raised revenue and profitability outlook for fiscal 2025."",
  ""Looking beyond this year, we anticipate meaningful growth, significant improvement in profitability and strong cash flow from operations."",
  ""We believe that we are well positioned for sustainable growth with additional leverage in our business model, we expect revenue and gross profit to continue growing faster than operating expenses."",
  ""We also expect to continue to generate meaningful, positive free cash flow."",
  ""In closing, this quarter's result, driven by positive momentum across key indicators, reflect the health of our business and the opportunities that lie ahead."",
  ""Our visibility into future revenue and robust balance sheet including a solid cash position ensure financial flexibility."",
  ""With this strong foundation, we are well-positioned to seize opportunities ahead and deliver sustainable growth."",
  ""With that, I would like to hand the call over to the operator to open the lines for questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking the questions, guys, and congrats on the quarter as well."",
  ""Wanted to first come back to the large customer announcements that came through the quarter, you announced some $10 million and $20 million agreements with some of these customers."",
  ""Can you just talk about the profile of these customers?"",
  ""And I just wanted to build on that last point – sorry to touch on macro there, but can you help us think, it sounds like the secular demand drivers remain intact, if not accelerating from where we stand today."",
  ""But what are you hearing from customers as far as budgets?"",
  ""Are these budgets significantly expanding from where we stand today?"",
  ""Or is there incremental dollars flowing into this area from other pockets?"",
  ""Can you help us think about that budget item?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Elad, you mentioned in your prepared remarks mobile data traffic becoming top of mind, meaning the need for advanced data analytics."",
  ""I know there's a lot you can't say around your product, but maybe talk about like some of the R&D initiatives from your summit, like what are your customers asking?"",
  ""What are you building and I'll start with that one?"",
  ""And sorry if I can squeeze one last one in."",
  ""Last quarter, you talked a lot about US, expanding into the US go-to-market."",
  ""Can you maybe just give us an update on how that kind of trended in the quarter?"",
  ""And then maybe plans for calendar 2025 in terms of further evolving or expanding your reach here in the US?"",
  ""So actually, the complexity customers are facing the similar to the – in the market."",
  ""So if you look at the demand drivers, the demand drivers are related to the complexity of finding the bad guys, which is related to them being able to better hide it."",
  ""It's related to the data that is growing in volume and diversity."",
  ""And actually, it's more difficult now to put their hands on them."",
  ""So customers have to do two things."",
  ""The first one is to expand in terms of capacity to allow more users to use the solutions, which means more licenses and also to increase capacity in terms of data volumes and diversity."",
  ""And also to improve functionality, which means that if you increase data sources and you have to uncover more hidden insights, you also need to modernize the solution with more analytics including AI-driven capabilities."",
  ""And by that, uncover So in certain segments, it is more relevant and it depends also in the capacity of the data customers there."",
  ""We don't expect it to come every quarter, this kind of four large deals, but we do expect the demand drivers to continue and intensify and more and more customers to upgrade either in expansion or in functionality or both."",
  ""And this is something that we expect also in the future."",
  ""So maybe I'll give you a wider view on what we see in the market."",
  ""So it will give you a data point and also our judgment on how we see the market."",
  ""So first of all, we see a very healthy demand from existing and new customers."",
  ""If you look at the new logos year-to-date, we added about 30-plus new customers compared to 2019 and full fiscal 2024."",
  ""So we do see more new logos this year already."",
  ""We see that more customers are budgeting with higher budgets."",
  ""And this is reflected in the larger upgrades and expansions that we see."",
  ""We also discussed the intensified demand drivers that I've just mentioned earlier."",
  ""And we continuously engage with customers and what we hear is that the challenges are growing and increasing and they are asking for budgets and we do see that the momentum is healthy and we see a tailwind in terms of demand."",
  ""Another data point that can help you understand is the Cognyte Intelligence Summit, which we discussed earlier in the call and also in the press release."",
  ""This is not an industry general event."",
  ""This is an event for Cognyte only."",
  ""And you can imagine the 300 attendees from almost 70 countries – about 70 countries came to listen to what we have to say to see the solutions, to see the innovation, to see the So it means that the demand is there."",
  ""Customers are willing to listen and to get more insights of what's new."",
  ""They are willing to put orders for expansions and upgrades and new logos are coming to us."",
  ""So overall, we feel very good about the , Mike."",
  ""So I mentioned the 5G is a demand driver because actually what our customers are doing is trying to convert certain activities of the adversaries into insights."",
  ""So adversaries they have to – to move they have to – to transfer money and to get money, they have to put their hands on material."",
  ""They have to communicate between themselves and all of it is actually digital data."",
  ""And so 5G in this respect actually is increasing the bandwidth of data."",
  ""So customers have to deal with vast amounts of data that are increasing."",
  ""And I also mentioned that Ericsson shared with us that actually in their report that the data is growing more than 20% year-over-year."",
  ""So this is a significant challenge for our customers because when the bandwidth is growing, it means that they have to do with more data."",
  ""It means that the new applications will be launched that now the bandwidth is increasing."",
  ""So new applications will come."",
  ""So they can communicate in different and more varied ways."",
  ""So, first of all, we continue to believe that North American market presents a growth opportunity for us."",
  ""Obviously, there are many potential customers and it's a wealthy market, so we are focusing on expanding presence there."",
  ""And we execute our plan, we'll make progress, I can tell you that I continue visiting existing and potential customers in the US and I get very, very good feedback on our technology and some of the customers became already referenced customers."",
  ""For some customers we just – we got already follow-on orders, which is another testimonial that it's not just a honeymoon, they don't just come to us for the first deal, but they are happy with what they get, they generate lots of value compared to competition."",
  ""And for that reason they come to us and expand."",
  ""And I mentioned it also in the – earlier in the call."",
  ""I can also tell you that a few weeks ago I visited another law enforcement agency, a very significant one in the US."",
  ""And I got very good feedback also in their – in a very significant success story using our technology."",
  ""So given the execution so far, the recent wins we see, the customers' feedback that I get, I do expect that the North American business will continue to grow in fiscal 2026 and beyond and become a more significant business for Cognyte."",
  ""So if you look at throughout our performance, you can see that in the last quarter, quarter-over-quarter, we were able to drive more and more profitability."",
  ""If you look at the year-to-date result, we grew our top line by a 11.5%, our gross profit grew by 14% on a nine months basis and the OpEx only grew by 4.5%."",
  ""So you can see that there is a lot of leverage."",
  ""We started the year with a certain guidance and then we increased incremental $9 million to the top line, well $7 million out of the $9 million went to profitability."",
  ""So the leverage exist in the model."",
  ""Looking ahead, we are very well positioned for the future."",
  ""We have very strong CRPO and total RPO, which are giving us the confidence that we can grow in the future and we believe that we'll be able to grow faster than revenue in gross profit and the profitability, meaning that the revenue and the gross profit will grow in a much faster pace versus OpEx and that will drive a strong result and better profitability also next year."",
  "", operator and , everyone for joining us on today's call."",
  ""Elad, David and I will be in New York in January to meet with investors and hope to see some of you then."",
  ""In the meantime, please feel free to reach out to me should you have any questions and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."",
  "" all for joining us.""

  ""First, I want to acknowledge the work being done by our teams all across Sportsman's Warehouse."",
  ""I'm proud of the collective efforts of our teams, which has enabled us to achieve meaningful progress towards our strategic goals."",
  ""Their commitment to great gear and great service as we execute our strategy was instrumental in delivering improved top line performance for the third quarter."",
  ""When we started this strategic journey early in 2024, we laid out a plan that included the refinement of our merchandising and inventory."",
  ""This process started with the rationalization and clean up of SKUs."",
  ""Last quarter, we've strategically expanded our inventory to ensure our stores were stocked with the products that our customers wanted most for our two largest seasons, hunting and holiday."",
  ""We implemented new and targeted promotions and ad campaigns aligned with normal seasonal demand to drive customer traffic and increase transactions."",
  ""We continue to see customers that are shopping for value, and we will further refine our marketing efforts and product sell campaigns to align with these consumer behaviors."",
  ""While total sales were down 5% in the third quarter, we were pleased that our fishing and camping department, along with our gift bar category, which includes optics, electronics, and cutlery, all comped positive for the quarter, with fishing up 13% over last year."",
  ""We also outpaced the adjusted mix in Q3 as we continue to lean into firearms and solidify our position as the leader in this category."",
  ""It's important to note that we were lapping some unique events from last year that impacted our year-over-year comparisons."",
  ""Jeff will address in greater detail in his prepared remarks."",
  ""In the three departments where we saw growth, we worked strategically over the last year to meet the needs of our customers and reduced non-performing inventory."",
  ""This has been part of our ongoing merchandising and inventory productivity strategy to provide our customers with the core goods they are looking for at the right time of year."",
  ""Strong performance in these three categories underscores the importance of being in stock the entire season, a muscle that we continue to develop as we transform Sportsman's Warehouse."",
  ""As we deepen the partnership with our key vendors, we are using data and analytics to assist us in being ready for the outdoor season, including key micro seasons that are geographically unique."",
  ""Given the current consumer environment and the emphasis on value and promotion-driven shopping, we were more aggressive with our sales driving initiatives, which pressured gross margins this quarter."",
  ""We also saw pressure from a shift in product mix to more firearms."",
  ""Additionally, we made a commitment in each season with clean merchandise, ensuring that our stores remain fresh, highlighting newness and staying relevant with our customers."",
  ""While this approach requires a price markdown cadence, it allows us to significantly minimize excess seasonal inventory and reinvest those dollars into our core products."",
  ""Lastly, we continue to clean up small pockets of localized inventory, which is also impacting gross margins in the fourth quarter."",
  ""By doing this, we create a more steady and predictable pattern of markdowns as we move through the different seasons."",
  ""While we expect pressure on gross margins to persist in Q4, we look to grow top line and improve our margins next year."",
  ""One of our strategic objectives is the continued investment, build-out and the implementation of IT systems and tools."",
  ""Once in place, these tools will assist in improvement of overall in-stock gross margins and inventory productivity."",
  ""These investments are a key part of resetting and rebuilding our business fundamentals to enhance our operational effectiveness."",
  ""As part of our ongoing store reset strategy, Great Gear, Great Service, we continue to enhance product displays and provide additional training for our outfitters."",
  ""The focus on elevated customer experience not only improves satisfaction, but also provides an opportunity to improve sales through better attachment."",
  ""We continue to see AOV from attachment at an all-time high from the in-store work being done around great service."",
  ""E-com-driven sales comp positive in the quarter as we continue to refine and improve our overall marketing and media mix model to drive incremental sales through the channel."",
  ""As part of our omni-channel strategy, we continue to test, learn, and understand through data-driven consumer insights the impact of different marketing activities on sales, customer acquisition, and brand awareness."",
  ""Looking ahead, as we move through the holiday season, we remain optimistic about our growth potential and the strategies in place to achieve our short- and long-term objectives, we will continue to emphasize newness and value as we look to win the balance of the holiday season."",
  ""To improve our holiday relevancy and capture incremental traffic during the season, we introduced the new omni-channel marketing campaign this year."",
  ""This campaign highlights great gear that is perfect for gifting or for treating yourself and marks a fresh approach to engaging with our customers during the holidays."",
  ""Our in-store experience has also been upgraded to reflect the fully integrated campaign, creating a cohesive and exciting shopping experience."",
  ""We are encouraged by our early holiday sales results, including Black Friday and Cyber Week, where we experienced our highest ever e-com transaction count."",
  ""This gives us confidence that the new marketing strategies we implemented are showing promise."",
  ""However, like other retailers, we continue to see a shift in how customers shop."",
  ""More than ever, our customers are shopping value, and they're willing to wait for the right promotion to make a purchase."",
  ""As we continue to navigate the balance of the holiday season and complex consumer environment, we'll continue to prioritize traffic-driving marketing and product pricing initiatives, exceptional customer service, and prudent inventory management."",
  ""As I conclude, I will emphasize the importance of disciplined expense management and reducing total inventory levels to generate positive free cash flow for the year."",
  ""We will prioritize the paydown of our debt as the primary use of excess cash flow, maintaining a strong balance sheet as the top priority as we manage the business for improved performance."",
  ""And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff to review our financial results in greater detail."",
  ""Participating on our Q3 call today is Paul Stone, our Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff White, our Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""I will now remind everyone of the company's Safe Harbor language."",
  ""The statements we make today contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which includes statements regarding expectations about our future results of operations, demand for our products, and growth of our industry, and actual results may differ materially from those suggested in such statements due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in the company's most recent Form 10-K and the company's other filings made with the SEC."",
  ""We will also disclose non-GAAP financial measures during today's call."",
  ""Definitions of such non-GAAP measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, are provided as supplemental financial information in our press release included as Exhibit 99.1 to the Form 8-K we furnished to the SEC today, which is also available on the Investor Relations section of our website at sportsmans.com."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to Paul."",
  ""I'll begin my remarks today with a review of our third quarter fiscal 2024 financial results, provide additional color on the balance sheet, then cover our updated outlook for fiscal 2024."",
  ""Net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 were $324.3 million compared to $340.6 million in the third quarter of 2023, a decline of 4.8%."",
  ""Same-store sales decreased 5.7% compared to the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""This is the second straight quarter of improved same-store sales trends and an improvement of 320 basis points versus the prior quarter."",
  ""As Paul mentioned, we locked event-driven demand during the quarter, primarily from our footwear and apparel clearance and liquidation events last year, as well as the spike in firearms and ammunition demand from the tragic events in Israel leading to the war and social unrest in October."",
  ""This tough comp led to a decline on a year-over-year basis in these categories."",
  ""Gross margin for the third quarter was 31.8% versus 30.3% in the prior-year comparable period."",
  ""Gross margins for the quarter came in below where we expected due to category and product mix as well as from customers shopping and buying more of our value and promotional products."",
  ""The category mix shift was driven by higher-than-expected penetration of firearms and ammo in October, which carries a lower overall gross margin."",
  ""Additionally, we underperformed our expectation in sales and penetration in our apparel and footwear departments, two of our highest margin categories."",
  ""SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was 30.8% or $100 million compared with 29.4% or $100.1 million in the third quarter of last year."",
  ""This is the first quarter where we comp our cost reduction initiatives implemented last year as evident in the smaller year-over-year decline versus previous quarters."",
  ""That said, payroll, pre-opening, and depreciation expenses were all down on a year-over-year basis."",
  ""These were offset, however, by the settlement of an outstanding lawsuit in the state of California."",
  ""Net loss for the third quarter was $0.4 million or negative $0.01 per diluted share compared to net loss of $1.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior-year period."",
  ""Adjusted net income in the third quarter of 2024 was $1.3 million or $0.04 per diluted share compared to adjusted net loss of $0.2 million or $0.01 per diluted share in the third quarter of the prior year."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was $16.4 million, compared to $16.2 million in the prior-year period."",
  ""Turning to our balance sheet and liquidity."",
  ""Third quarter ending inventory increased versus last quarter and was $438.1 million compared to $446.3 million at the end of the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""On a per store basis, inventory was down 2.5% versus last year's third quarter."",
  ""In the third quarter, we made strategic investments in our inventory to drive sales in an effort to, one, ensure solid in-stock position on our core products; two, add newness in our stores; and three, effectively support the hunting and holiday selling seasons."",
  ""As expected, this created a seasonal peak for our inventory levels as we ended the third quarter."",
  ""We are confident that we will end fiscal 2024 with an inventory balance less than $350 million as we continue to execute on our holiday strategy and clean up pockets of unproductive localized inventory across our stores."",
  ""Regarding liquidity, we ended the third quarter with a total debt balance of $154 million and total liquidity of $151 million."",
  ""We have approximately $148 million available under our credit facilities for borrowing."",
  ""We expect the outstanding balance on our line of credit to end the year below $130 million as we continue to reduce inventory and closely manage expenses."",
  ""Careful management of the balance sheet remains the priority and although the company is not yet generating profits, we still expect positive free cash flow for the full year 2024."",
  ""Any excess cash will go directly to debt paydown."",
  ""Turning now to our guidance."",
  ""As Paul mentioned in his remarks, the underlying business continues to experience persistent pressure from the difficult consumer environment weighing on discretionary spending, which is impacting our sales and gross margins."",
  ""While I am pleased at how the team has executed thus far during the holiday, given the shift in consumer spending, we will continue to use targeted promotions and value-driving campaigns to improve store traffic and top line sales."",
  ""Similar to last quarter, we expect this to weigh on our gross margins in Q4, which is factored into our updated guidance."",
  ""Now looking at our updated full year 2024 guidance."",
  ""We now expect fiscal year 2024 net sales to be in the range of $1.18 billion to $1.2 billion, adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $23 million to $29 million, and total inventory to be below $350 million."",
  ""To reiterate, the low-end of our adjusted EBITDA range still assumes positive free cash flow for the full year."",
  ""We also now expect capital expenditures for 2024 to be in the range of $17 million to $20 million, primarily consisting of maintenance on our fleet and technology investments relating to merchandising and store productivity."",
  ""That concludes our prepared remarks today."",
  ""I will now turn the call back over to the operator to facilitate any questions.""

  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""First, if maybe you could just cover sort of the cadence of comps that you saw during the third quarter by month."",
  ""It sounds like maybe we leaned in a bit more on promotions."",
  ""Wondering what the response was, your customers' response was to that during the quarter."",
  ""And then maybe just if you can cover what we're seeing quarter-to-date."",
  ""I guess your fourth quarter implied comp would suggest down, call it, like 5% to 6% year-over-year."",
  ""Are we tracking in line with that level that you're guiding to for the fourth quarter, maybe just a little more color there as well?"",
  ""Remind us maybe just I think with the calendar shift, Jeff."",
  ""The 53rd week last year, I think you had in the past said that contributed something like $15 million."",
  ""But just help us with the math really quickly, if you could."",
  ""And then maybe just could you guys unpack a little bit more about the new approach to promos that we're talking about, maybe just a little bit more clarity around what we're doing in terms of everyday value and the gifting that you mentioned earlier?"",
  ""I know, like, historically, at least over the last, call it, 6 to 12 months, you guys have highlighted sort of running a promotion that might be around the shooting sports item that drives traffic, and then you work to get attach off of that."",
  ""Are we still – is that playbook still in place, and this is just layering on top of that, maybe just a little bit more on the promotional sort of posture that we have here."",
  ""Maybe just if I could sneak one more in for Jeff on the SG&A side of things."",
  ""Sounds like we're lapping some of the cost-cutting initiatives that we had from last year."",
  ""Does that mean that we're sort of winding down on the savings on SG&A on a year-over-year basis?"",
  ""Is there more to come that maybe we see an another sort of round of cost-cutting?"",
  ""Maybe just help us understand sort of where we have some levers to drive that SG&A line item lower in the fourth quarter."",
  ""Makes a lot of sense."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I guess I'd like to start on gross margin."",
  ""I know you noted that it came in a little softer than expected in the quarter, but still a nice expansion year-over-year."",
  ""Seems to suggest that the refined approach to merchandising has reduced the risk of end-of-season clearance, even though you noted that it's clearly a priority to Got it."",
  ""And then as we turn our eyes to 4Q, similar question, but guidance seems to imply a little bit of a step up in year-over-year expansion in gross margin."",
  ""As you sit here today, level of confidence based on that inventory build that, you're not going to have to have intense discounting at the end of the quarter?"",
  ""And then just sort of a housekeeping, I believe your exposure to tariffs or direct imports would be limited to private label, which is a low-single digit percent of sales."",
  ""First one, Jeff, just, can you put a finer point for us on fourth quarter gross margin based on your response to the SG&A question?"",
  ""And If I look at the midpoint of your EBITDA guide, it seems to imply 4Q gross margins sub-30%."",
  ""I just want to make sure I have that math correct."",
  ""So then maybe I'll ask going back to the SG&A question, if I carve out the items, I guess on an adjusted basis, right, your SG&A dollars were around $98 million this quarter, and it sounds like you're saying that's the new base that we should be thinking about in 4Q and into 2025?"",
  ""And then, Paul, can you just expand a bit more on the omni-channel marketing campaign?"",
  ""Is this more top-of-funnel spend to drive brand awareness or are you more focused on targeting existing customers?"",
  ""Just any more color on what you're doing and what seems to be working best for you?"",
  "" for the color, guys."",
  ""Best of luck over the rest of holiday."",
  ""I want to stay on – I want to focus on hunting."",
  ""So, good to see fishing growth, camping, gift bar."",
  ""Hunting was one that I think you guys had commented kind of after fishing was the focus area to rightsize inventory, strategy, store layout, etcetera."",
  ""Some peers called out some better results in both camp and hunt earlier today, but I guess I was a little surprised to see that wasn't one of the categories that had growth in the quarter."",
  ""So, could you, kind of, put a finer point on kind of performance in the quarter and where you guys are at from a strategic standpoint in that category?"",
  ""Maybe, Jeff, just a quick clarification question."",
  ""Firearms are down year-over-year for you guys, but I think , Paul, Jeff."",
  ""First question for me is really just around consumer behavior."",
  ""It sounds like at the low end still really need to be promotional to kind of drive transactions."",
  ""I'm curious if you've seen change in behavior for the higher-end customers."",
  ""Do you need to kind of prompt them to come in and spend or have you seen kind of the higher end hold up okay?"",
  ""And then I want to dig back in little bit more on primarily firearms, but it also hits ammo."",
  ""Maybe your confidence level as we look at Q4 on being able to outperform Okay."",
  ""And then just looking at holiday season, and as that applies to Q4, maybe if you can give us – it seems like you guys feel pretty confident at this point in the guidance that you gave, especially the inventory guidance on being able to get that down."",
  ""Maybe if you can tell us whether historically or today kind of at this point in the quarter, are you 70% towards your goal?"",
  ""It seems like last year there is more catch up on promotions and trying to clear out inventory, you know, later through December."",
  ""Do you feel like you're further along in the quarter so far on kind of getting to your guidance numbers?"",
  ""And the last one for me is just any additional thoughts around new stores?"",
  ""I think you guys said you expect to do one this next year."",
  ""Can you give us any insight into timing?"",
  ""And then, as you look at this new store, will this be one where you're testing and trying new things or will we see maybe more of a traditional format in a new store opening?"",
  ""I would say, Matt – and this is Paul – October, same approach we took there as we were going against the firearms and ammo bump that we had as we've gotten into November, December that's really been promotional around being able to drive people to traffic around gifting, which was an arm we didn't lever, we didn't have last year, but as we had less open to buy."",
  ""And so, I think strategically, if we look at that and we planned on it as we came into spring to ensure that we're able to look at true gifting and to be able to take that into consideration as we get into November and December."",
  ""So I think a little different look than what we've had in October."",
  ""What I would tell you, and just to reiterate, I mean, the team's really done a nice job around the attach."",
  ""And as we've used this from an AOV and attachment standpoint as we draw people in from the promotion, the teams well exceeded our expectation on what we've been able to do from attach rate and an AOV to be able to give a total solution to the consumer when they come into the stores."",
  ""And I think the other component would be just to touch on, as we've really looked at marketing completely different."",
  ""As Susan and team has come on to the organization, it's really been focused around removing the print and be extremely directional in digital."",
  ""And so, we're super excited about what that look like, the fact that we can measure, our ROAS versus really with no visibility with ROAS on the print and what that looks like."",
  ""So both of those things I think come into play and more digital focused approach to where we can be extremely targeted on what that looks like, and then to be able to play in different channels from a digital standpoint that the company has not played in."",
  ""So bullish on both of those and what they're doing in particular from AOV and attach."",
  ""I think it's clearly bottom."",
  ""And we've got a lot of runway just from an exposure standpoint as we think about it is for us to be able to attack the bottom of the funnel to move up from a search standpoint."",
  ""And I think we truly felt the benefits of it from an e-com as we went through the holidays and the entire Cyber Week, the investments being made versus the print component of it."",
  ""So, I would say right now, as we look at it, we have a lot of different channels."",
  ""We're active in social, and we've been able to take a couple of different ones and even working with affiliates as we think about different programs that gives us more exposure to a big part of our business where we have an opportunity to be able to reinvest what those print dollars would have looked like in the past and be able to put that into work and really work hard for us."",
  ""But to answer your question originally, I mean, the majority of it is coming in bottom funnel."",
  ""I'll let Jeff start, then I'll add some comments there."",
  ""And I think – I mean, the one thing that I would add, too, is as we think about and knowing in particular what the October comp was and the weight that have in particular from an ammo in our overall business but the – I think the team has done an extremely nice job of being able to offset that, I'll also say I think we took, an opportunity there as we went from promotional to drive people into the stores to really be able to clean up on our firearms – non-go-forward firearms, to be able to help us to be able to pull down our inventory levels, to allow us to be able to reinvest back into ammo, which is much greater from a consumables standpoint, to be able to drive people to the stores."",
  ""So, as we look at it, we're not calling hunt out as a positive comp, but overall from an organization standpoint and the lapping that we had, we felt really good with the performance OEM support."",
  ""And I think we're happy both with Second Amendment."",
  ""I'll reiterate, we didn't see a run up with the election."",
  ""I mean, this was an absolute non-event for us from any type of run up from a firearms or ammo standpoint."",
  ""We didn't see any spikes in the business as we got to the election."",
  ""And we liked both how the Second Amendment performed as well as really our first time and being able to engage with our veterans and what the Veteran's Day promotional activity look like and connecting with that consumers that we really haven't paid as much attention to as what we need to."",
  ""So, both of those, I would say we felt good with what that performance looked like."",
  ""I think the one thing I would just say on that, Mark, is just the ability now to be able to target our consumers, and as we get much more granular and being able to go out through digital, that we have that opportunity to be able to kind of parse that out future state on what that's going to look like on how we go to market both from a price point standpoint."",
  ""I would say overall, I know others that have reported that they've seen uptick from the higher end consumer, and, I mean, that's not something that we have seen."",
  ""But I think that in our opinion, we have an opportunity to just be much more precise on the consumers, and already, the information we have on our consumers is to be a much, much more targeted approach to them future state than what we have been in the past, Mark, to be able to communicate with them regularly."",
  ""I think the dot-com performance from a firearms' standpoint and just the investment we continue to make in dot-com and knowing that that's ultimately going to drive the majority of those firearm purchases to the stores to allow us to be able to capture the attach and the AOV is something that we think gives us a competitive advantage and allows our outfitters in the stores to really do their jobs and to be able to serve the customers and attach and to grow the AOV."",
  ""So pleased with what the teams have been able to do from an e-com standpoint to be able to drive those firearms through the stores and allow us to be able to give the total solution to the consumer."",
  ""And I think that's – I would say that's our biggest concern is that as we think about December, January, we've got – we're very, I think, opportunistic on being able to close out."",
  ""But at the same time, I don't think we're in a position where we're chasing the inventory in January and into December as last year we looked at, and I'm proud of the team and the work that's been done to ensure that we have the core goods, that we're going to need the right merchandise as we get into to January to where you're just not putting yourself in a position where it's completely clearance liquidation, that you're allowed to be able to get the consumer really what they want as they come out as well."",
  ""So, I think, and Jeff said it well, there's a big lift in front of us the next 14 days, and we don't want to get in front of our skis too much."",
  ""But I think ultimately, we think the position we're in from an inventory standpoint will allow us to be able to serve the customers the way we need to in January without having to be in a heavy clearance liquidation mode to be able to get that down, that inventory level down by end of the Q. Yeah."",
  ""I mean, there's an opportunity to lean into and I think test and learn as we really focus on personal protection and what that looks like and it's one of our best states for personal protection, as well as probably one of our toughest states from a fish."",
  ""So as we lean into it and look at it, I mean, there'll be other cases where we could say we could really test more on it, and we'll do that in some for our existing fleet."",
  ""But, I mean, this is a heavy, heavy personal protection, and in one of our best-performing states, so we'll be adding another store or two."",
  ""By way of note, we will be participating in the ROTH Capital Deer Valley Conference this Thursday, and we'll be at ICR Conference in Orlando in mid-January, where we will host in-person one-on-one and group meetings."",
  "" for everyone for joining today's call."",
  ""As we look at the comps for Q3, first thing I would say is we saw sequential improvement month-over-month all through Q3."",
  ""We were being more promotional in effort to offset some of the tough comps that we had."",
  ""Q3 is where we lap the liquidation of apparel and footwear last year, and then the Israel-Hamas war that broke out."",
  ""So, we were proactively trying to address those with being more promotional, but we did see that trend improvement."",
  ""And as we said in our prepared remarks, it did surprise us with the performance that we had where we outperformed expectations walking into the month of October specifically."",
  ""As you look at Q4, the one thing on your comment of the down 5% to 6% comps that I think you need to consider is the 53rd week from last year rolling that over and then what that does in terms of the comp that it creates because you're taking a week of January and moving it into a week, comparable against a week of October."",
  ""So you have a very high revenue week last year versus a low revenue week."",
  ""So there is just some nuance there on that that I would say go back and look at in your numbers."",
  ""The $15 million was, what that one week, the 53rd week, contributed."",
  ""But, again, when you're looking at that now at a year-over-year comp, you have an additional week that's falling into a January timeframe, which is a much slower time of year being compared against a week last year in Q4 that was inclusive of an October week, which is a much higher revenue week."",
  ""So, we're – I would say that as we look at Q4 with those adjustments being made, we're looking at continual sequential improvement in comp store sales through the end of the year."",
  ""Paul and I have made the commitment, and we've talked about it in previous calls."",
  ""As we go through these cost-cutting exercises, in order to meet our great service guarantee to our customers, we need to start investing back into store labor."",
  ""So we will always be looking for additional cost-savings in the organization."",
  ""There's still more cost savings to be had in various back office type functions of the organization, and we'll keep exploring those."",
  ""But as we realize those savings, we're going to be investing back into the service component and the customer-facing components of the organization."",
  ""So, as you think about go forward, SG&A, Q3 and what your models are going to imply for Q4 is kind of steady state as I would think about it."",
  ""As we looked at Q3, and we called it out a little bit, we outperformed in areas of the business like the hunt category, specifically firearms and ammo, where in our initial forecast we did not expect that outperformance."",
  ""So when you outperform in that area, the rate that you're going to drive there is going to drive gross margins lower."",
  ""Also, if you look at our inventory build during Q3, it was a significant build, and there was some freight costs of bringing that merchandise in that had a – not a large, but it was more significant than what we would have seen in the past impact to gross margin."",
  ""So, looking at the rate, looking at the mix of the sales, where we are driving the promotions to, it was a targeted approach to drive traffic into the stores and then just the freight build and getting in-stock for the holiday ultimately led to the less-than-expected result for gross margins for Q3."",
  ""We're very confident in our ability to execute on the guidance we gave to hit end-of-quarter inventory and the guidance we gave for top line sales and bottom line profitability."",
  ""We're addressing the – what is a distressed consumer market and aggressive holiday season, and we're making the right moves, and we're being promotional where we need to in order to make sure we end the year clean, and we drive the right traffic into the stores to meet our expectations for the full year."",
  ""So I would say we have a lot of confidence in hitting our year-end numbers that we went out with today."",
  ""I think it's a little – it's under 3% would be our direct exposure on our private brands to those tariffs."",
  ""We've been actively looking and monitoring and finding out ways to reduce any increase in tariffs and the exposure we have there."",
  ""The other areas of the business, obviously from the branded side, our manufacturers, we're looking at their supply chains."",
  ""The one thing I'll call out is we probably penetrate higher from a branded product perspective in products that are made in the United States than other retailers."",
  ""But that doesn't mean that we wouldn't be impacted or have to look at different pricing measures as those tariffs come into effect moving into 2025."",
  ""So it's something that we're going to actively monitor."",
  ""But from a private brand perspective, you're correct in that, it's very little exposure there."",
  ""Justin, while we didn't give a specific guidance, I would say that if you look at the degradation that we had last year with the clearancing activity, we do not foresee an anniversarying of that."",
  ""So you can look at what we lost in margin last year during 4Q on the liquidation and clearancing and assume that we are going to gain that back as you think about the Q4 results."",
  ""Without giving you specifics, that's probably the way that I would guide you on Q4 margin."",
  ""4Q, maybe just a little bit more with holiday and the staffing that we have to do in the store."",
  ""But back to the previous comment, that's pretty much steady state as we move forward."",
  ""On the performance for the quarter, we had a big headwind with the lapping of the Israel-Hamas, specifically in the ammo category."",
  ""When you compare that, it was a really big headwind."",
  ""So, from a firearm perspective, we're very pleased with what we performed in Q3."",
  ""We outperformed the run rate of Yeah."",
  ""On the on the From the vendor side, I would say that we are seeing better deals come to market, especially in the categories that have slowed down maybe after the election cycle."",
  ""You're seeing more deals from the firearm and ammo manufacturers."",
  ""Fish for us is a good performer in terms of OEM support, and what we're seeing there from the vendor side."",
  ""And Paul mentioned it on one of the previous questions."",
  ""We've been really pleased with the attachment rate specifically on firearms."",
  ""So, while we've been more promotional from a firearms' standpoint, the margin degradation is not such that we're not offsetting it or being more accretive with how high the attachment rate has become."",
  ""We've become really good at making sure we get that additional purchase when someone's coming in for a firearm."",
  ""We're no longer viewing it just as transactional in nature, meaning they come in, pick up the firearm, we send them out the door."",
  ""It's more of a solution-type selling thing where we're selling them all the ancillary goods that go with that firearm and making sure we get additional margin accretive items attached to just the firearm."",
  ""In terms of sales, we're tracking the current quarter sales model versus how 2019 was modeled."",
  ""It's the same shortened holiday season."",
  ""We have five less selling days this quarter for holiday than we did last year."",
  ""So, I would say we are happy with our progress versus that model."",
  ""We are exceeding that model."",
  ""But there's still a lot of sales left to occur."",
  ""These last two weeks, we're 14 days from Christmas Eve right now, so you're down to your last 14 selling days, there are some big days between now and Christmas."",
  ""And we need to make sure that we're focused on achieving our sales targets."",
  ""We're confident that we have the ability, that we have the right inventory, the right in-stocks, the stores and our outfitters are ready to serve the customers and get the goods out the door, but there's still some work to be done in terms of the size of revenue left for the quarter."",
  ""Mark, the new store timing next year will be kind of in the late-Q2, early-Q3 timeframe in terms of opening."",
  ""It'll be a standard 30,000 square-foot box."",
  ""We'll incorporate what we've learned over the last year in terms of visual merchandising, store layout, sightlines, cleanliness, departmental sizes into that layout, but I would not say that you're going to see a drastic change."",
  ""We're not going to test or look at trying something completely different from what our core store footprint is."",
  ""It's in an area of the country where we have a lot of other – it's in Arizona, so it's a state that we know."",
  ""We know what the consumer wants."",
  ""We have the brand presence."",
  ""So I think the go-to market strategy there is pretty set in terms of how we're looking at that.""

  ""Appreciate you taking the questions."",
  ""David, you mentioned in your prepared remarks a few things, focusing on expanding innovations, including newer, higher-priced Firefly offerings and potentially accelerating Firefly by integrating further into GenStudio."",
  ""I was hoping you could just maybe expand on how you're thinking about the adoption curves of those efforts."",
  ""And as a second part, Dan, if you can just add any commentary on how you're incorporating some of these newer efforts into forecasts, if there's conservatism just given they're newer or just how to think about that, also useful."",
  "" for taking the question."",
  ""I guess maybe to the point that you just alluded to in terms of AI being meaningful as part of the broader growth narrative for business, can you maybe talk about how you're thinking about the growth driver from Firefly, from GenStudio?"",
  ""And kind of how will we see that percolate through the year in terms of the net new Digital Media ARR?"",
  ""Is that something that you think is more going to be showing up in the DX business?"",
  ""It'd be great to get some color there."",
  ""And then anything, Dan, that we should think through, given the new guidance methodology, around seasonality or linearity for net new ARR in the Digital Media business?"",
  ""David, I was wondering if I could just follow-up on your last comment on sort of obviously driving new users, new adoptions, incredibly important."",
  ""I just – is there pricing sensitivity, meaning you're delivering so much value, I think that pricing, given the value you're delivering, would be a bigger lever unless there's pricing sensitivity."",
  ""So, can you just walk through that a little bit more, because it feels like you should be able to get sort of all three vectors going at the same time, whereas I know you got to focus more on bringing people in and making them successful?"",
  ""But I'm sort of – I guess, is there something else on the pricing side that I'm missing why you're not getting that as well?"",
  ""I guess a quick follow-up for Dan."",
  ""Dan, obviously, Black Monday fell into your first quarter this current year."",
  ""Any color you can offer in terms of what that meant, if at all, to Creative Cloud net new ARR this quarter?"",
  "", guys, for taking the question."",
  ""A lot of excitement from you guys on the conference call about the pace of innovation going on in the business and we hear that excitement from creative professionals, and they talk about an acceleration in the pace of innovation."",
  ""But apologies to state the obvious, but investors aren't feeling that excited and they aren't showing that excitement."",
  ""The stock is a major underperformer on a year-to-date basis, and it's down again on an after-hours basis today."",
  ""And I would point to, it's the lack of acceleration that we're seeing in the numbers, right?"",
  ""Digital Media net new ARR this quarter grew just – or Creative Cloud grew 2%."",
  ""You're guiding to decelerating growth into the forward year, despite all this innovation."",
  ""And I think the question that it brings up in an investor's mind All this innovation, new monetization avenues, pricing going up, but the growth is going in the wrong direction."",
  ""Like, is there a part of the equation that's not working?"",
  ""Is there something that we're not seeing that is taking away that momentum in the numbers that's not – so we're not seeing the acceleration in the numbers, if you will?"",
  ""I wanted to ask, David, to you if I could on Doc Cloud specifically."",
  ""Growth was certainly strong this quarter."",
  ""And I just wanted to understand some of the context associated with durability."",
  ""And if you could break it into some of the parts, it looks like your monthly active users, it continues to grow well."",
  ""And in addition to that, how are you thinking about leveraging the value there in terms of price, specifically within the growth of Doc Cloud?"",
  ""And again, the broader question is just on the durability of Doc Cloud grew 23% over the course of the quarter in terms of ARR."",
  ""Trying to understand how durable it is and what the pieces are?"",
  ""And then I have a follow-up."",
  ""It sort of leads into my follow-up question, if I could sneak it in, is we've talked about, during the course of this call tonight, various drivers of growth for ARR."",
  ""And I just wanted to specifically ask about consumption as we think about FY 2025."",
  ""And the question is, is that going to be a contributor towards ARR growth or should investors really be thinking about we're trying to match my seats, if you will, and really shouldn't be about consumption being additive to growth in 2025?"",
  "" Really just Firefly Services across all the franchises, Photoshop, Lightroom, et cetera, what could that integration effort do to the conversion activity with the top of funnel?"",
  ""Dan, you noted that your current RPO was up 13% in the quarter, which results in a 10% three-year CAGR for current RPO."",
  ""Would you expect that over time or at least in fiscal 2025 that your current RPO growth would be closer to what you just reported for Q4 or might revert more to the lower three-year CAGR?"",
  ""And then for David, if I could, just since there were so many mentions of tiered offerings, is the concept there more around functionality at the product level as compared to the olden days of tiering that was more about segmentation and packaging as in the old CS days or is it more currently around the functionality that you're offering on a product-by-product basis?Well, Keith, maybe I'll talk about that."",
  ""I mean, if you take a step back and think about the year and I'll certainly address the feedback that you're sharing, from our perspective, when we guided at the beginning of year, when we re-guided then in the middle of the year to $19.50 billion and then when we guided in Q3, I mean, the reality is we beat all those three targets that we had issued, beginning of the year, middle of the year, and end of the year."",
  ""I think specifically, maybe as it relates to the Q4 Digital Media net new ARR and thinking about it from the Creative, the one thing that I'll point out there is that actually Creative did better than probably is evident in that if you think about the contribution of Acrobat that went into the Creative bucket versus the Document Cloud business."",
  ""So, certainly, Acrobat continues to do well, a record as you saw."",
  ""But the non-Acrobat contribution in Creative actually had more growth than what you would see if you just look at it from a Creative Cloud ARR."",
  ""I think to your bigger question about what's happening in the business, and as we think about it, the scale of the business right now, certainly, as this entire world moves towards generative AI, as David said, we're executing on both the proliferation play at the at the bottom with Express and Acrobat, and the high end, with the Creative Pro and with the enterprise, we are seeing significant adoption of that."",
  ""And I think GenStudio will also be a good unlock because GenStudio actually brings this all together in the enterprise in a way that nobody else can."",
  ""And so when we think about Firefly Services, you think about the custom models, you think about the ability to move all of that into campaigns at pace, that we are seeing significant traction in that particular space."",
  ""So, the business is going through a change as it relates to the lower end."",
  ""But for the core Creative as well as for the enterprise, it actually headed absolutely in line with our expectations with good acceleration."",
  ""And on the consumer, communicator space, I think the traction that we're seeing with Express on proliferation also gives us a lot of optimism for how that part of the business is also doing well."",
  ""And so we take our targets seriously."",
  ""It's the beginning of the year."",
  ""We want to go keep executing and innovating on it."",
  ""To the point that I think you as well as others have asked, is there opportunity in the growth agenda, not just to think about the innovation and the offerings but to make sure that as we tier these, that the pricing and the value is appropriate?"",
  ""And I think you'll continue to see us, I think David mentioned that in his prepared remarks as well as Dan did, that you'll see us also have new tiered offerings that reflect that value that we're providing to the Creative Pro as well to the business segments."",
  ""And maybe the thing I'll add to that is the durability of that, to your point, in languages, as we roll that out in languages, as we roll it out across multiple documents and as we roll it out in enterprises and B2B specifically."",
  ""So, again, significant headroom in terms of the innovation agenda of how Acrobat can be made even more meaningful as a knowledge tool within the enterprise."",
  ""I think, Keith, you're going to see \""consumption\"" add to ARR in two or maybe three ways more so in 2025 than in 2024."",
  ""The first, and David alluded to this, is if you have a video offering and that video offering that will be a pure consumption pricing associated with it."",
  ""I think the second is in GenStudio and for enterprises and what they are seeing with respect to Firefly Services, which, again, I think David touched on how much momentum we are seeing in that business."",
  ""So, that is, in effect, a consumption business as it relates to the enterprise, so I think that will also continue to increase."",
  ""And then I think you'll see us with perhaps more premium price offering."",
  ""So, the intention is that consumption is what's driving the increased ARR, but it may be as a result of a tier in the pricing rather than a consumption model where people actually have to monitor it."",
  ""So, it's just another way, much like AI Assistant is of monetizing it, but it's not like we're going to be tracking every single generation for the user, it will just be at a different tier."",
  ""And we think that, that's both a better way to deliver value as well as to get the monetization."",
  ""For a second, you actually cut out."",
  ""And so you said Firefly, we heard that."",
  ""Did you mention any other product before we answer that question, Brad, just to make sure we capture your question?"",
  ""And since that was the last question, let me again maybe, in quick summary, just talk about, first, we had a strong 2024."",
  ""But I think that really sets us up even better for a strong 2025, given the innovation that we've had."",
  ""I think as it relates to all three businesses that we have, the Creative Cloud with everything that we've done around AI, we have a lot of momentum going into the business and a really great diverse portfolio in terms of both the customers as well as our offerings."",
  ""Acrobat continues to perform really well with AI Assistant as we bring it to other languages, get more vertical use cases for that particular solution and extend it beyond a single document."",
  ""We continue to think that the Document Cloud has significant opportunity ahead of us."",
  ""And I think bringing that all together with Digital Experience, Q4 was really an extremely strong quarter as it related to us bringing all these solutions together in GenStudio."",
  ""I think much like we did with AEP and apps and data and have driven that to $1 billion business, I feel just the same amount of excitement with what we can do with content and AI and how we can accelerate the creation of that all the way from ideation to the multiple variations that's required."",
  ""So, we look forward to sharing more with you at the end of our Q1."",
  ""But in the interim,  for joining us, and happy holidays."",
  ""Yeah, I'll go ahead and get started."",
  ""So, AI obviously has been a huge area of focus for us."",
  ""And frankly, our community has been using it at amazing rates, so we're very excited."",
  ""You heard the 16 billion generations that we talked about in the prepared remarks, and that's really a function of the investments we've made in creating the broadest set of models."",
  ""We've talked about Imaging, Vector, Design in the past."",
  ""We now have video and audio in beta form as well."",
  ""And the foundational difference between what we do and what everyone else does in the market really comes down to three things."",
  ""One is, commercially safe, the way we train the models; two is the incredible control we bake into the model; and three is the integration that we make with these models into our products, increasingly, of course, in our CC flagship applications, but also in Express and Lightroom and these kinds of applications, but also in Anil's DX products as well."",
  ""So, that set of things is a critical part of the foundation and a durable differentiator for us as we go forward."",
  ""Now, as we introduce the video model, which we expect to have in market early next year, that's going to create an opportunity to further tier our Creative Cloud offerings."",
  ""As you, I'm sure, understand, video generation is a much higher-value activity than image generation."",
  ""And as a result, it gives us the ability to start to tier Creative Cloud more actively there."",
  ""In addition to that, this year, we introduced Firefly Services."",
  ""That's off to a great start."",
  ""We have a lot of customers that are using that."",
  ""A couple we talked about on the call include Tapestry."",
  ""They're using it for scaled content production."",
  ""Pepsi, for their Gatorade brand, is enabling their customers to personalize any merchandise that they're buying, in particular, starting with Gatorade bottles."",
  ""And these have been very, very productive for them, and we are seeing this leveraged by a host of other companies for everything from localization at scale, to personalization at scale, to user engagement or just raw content production at scale as well."",
  ""And then last, not to get missed in all of this is everything we're doing with AI Assistant."",
  ""AI Assistant for Acrobat is off to an incredibly strong start and we see it continuing to accelerate."",
  ""So, all of this has built a great foundation for us in FY 2024."",
  ""It's given us a lot of signal from our customer base, and it's really we've learned a lot that we intend to apply as we optimize the value and the tiering for our customers going forward."",
  ""And just building on David's comments as it relates to the FY 2025 guide, we talk about all of the great innovation that's in flight, I would say the velocity of innovation is greater today than it's ever been."",
  ""We called out products like Express, AI Assistant, Firefly, premium tiers in DX, GenStudio."",
  ""The good thing is, is they're meaningful contributors today to the financial performance."",
  ""And extrapolating the momentum that we see in those products, taking a point of view on the future pipeline of innovation, how we bring that to life, deeply natively integrated into our products and further extend the value we offer to customers as well as the additional segments we can access."",
  ""All of this comes together to take a perspective of what 2025 looks like based on the strong start that we have and the meaningful contribution in FY 2024."",
  ""I'm happy to take that."",
  ""So, first of all, yeah, as we mentioned, we're really excited about the FY 2024 momentum that we're seeing that we're carrying into it."",
  ""And we've had this conversation in the past around how we think about the growth algorithm for the Digital Media business."",
  ""So, maybe kind of let me reiterate a little bit of that."",
  ""We've talked about this in the context of P times Q plus V in the past, where P is new users, bringing in more people into franchise."",
  ""We're continuing to do that."",
  ""Obviously, with the introduction of Express, we're seeing a lot of great growth there, whether it's through our phones channel reaching out to SMB, whether it's corporate reaching out to the mid-market, or whether it's working more closely with Anil and the DX business and the integrations we have between Express and the DX business reaching into large companies."",
  ""We're doing a lot in terms of proliferation of Express into education."",
  ""We've done a number of partnerships that we talked about with Box, ChatGPT, HubSpot and others, but also our own products like Acrobat Workflows, from Acrobat and Reader into Express."",
  ""So, really pushing to drive more new customers into the franchise in addition to the continued growth that we're getting in our core Creative products."",
  ""Second, in terms of the core Creative products, this is where the And then lastly, the business value for customers in enterprise or corporate, that's where the value-based selling that we do along with the Digital Experience business really plays out."",
  ""Firefly Services, as I mentioned, with Gatorade, Tapestry, and a whole host of others that have come, everyone in this space is driving towards personalization of that content, and they absolutely need a scaled production and automation pipeline to generate more content."",
  ""And that's what Firefly Services does."",
  ""And as it has hit this level of escape velocity, we're now integrating it more into the DX products, in particular, GenStudio, so that it becomes a more holistic solution as we go into FY 2025 and accelerate that."",
  ""And that's – Alex, that's what's leading to the guide of 11%."",
  ""If you really take a step back, that's one of the best guides we've given in terms of next year ARR growth."",
  ""But one thing maybe to keep in mind is the composition of that growth is going to be a little different next year compared to FY 2024."",
  ""Again, the growth algorithm is new users, new products, and value and pricing."",
  ""New users and new products will be a more significant part of the mix as we go into FY 2025 and we're looking forward to sort of that foundational base of the business growing and driving the business."",
  ""And then just to build on that, Alex, and I appreciate the question around the shape of FY 2025."",
  ""Here's what I'll share about it."",
  ""We all know we changed the guidance methodology into 2025."",
  ""The guide around the ending ARR book of business growth, we just have a strong point of view."",
  ""It's a better indicator of business health trajectory."",
  ""David talked about the growth algorithm, the growth agenda at the company, new subscribers, the predominant driver of growth has been, continues to be."",
  ""The second leg, cross-sell, upsell."",
  ""This is something the company has honed a really great skill at over time once we bring people into the Adobe ecosystem to journey them through, the rich set of technologies and products that we have to bring them deeper into the ecosystem."",
  ""And then lastly, David mentioned pricing."",
  ""This is about how we segment the product portfolio, the value that we deliver to our customers."",
  ""So, as we think about the innovation, as we think about the growth algorithm and as we think about increasingly monetizing the rich set of innovation that we've already brought to market as well as in the pipeline to be brought to market."",
  ""Quarterly profile, we view it as less important."",
  ""Really want to focus on revenue and EPS, focus on the annual book of business growth."",
  ""We think that's the most important way to look at the business and it's also how we, as the management team, run the business."",
  ""We've talked about this in the context of proliferation versus short-term monetization and how we have to balance both of those, and that's something that we take very seriously and we look at that."",
  ""If you look at the lower end of the market, as we have entered with Express and Lightroom, Acrobat, and by the way, the web and mobile motion for us has been productive in bringing in a lot more new users."",
  ""And so you'll expect to see us do more of that and introduce more products in that segment in FY 2025 as well."",
  ""And there is certainly price sensitivity at that side of the market when it comes to both freemium users and also converted to paid users, and we'll continue to enable that."",
  ""When it comes to the core business, and this is the business of creative professionals, we are very focused on introducing new value that is going to create more segmentation and more tiering and get aligned value and pricing to what we are delivering there."",
  ""So, we do see a tremendous amount of opportunity there going forward because the value that we bring and the efficiency we bring to the content creation process there is very significant."",
  ""And then last and certainly not least, as we talked about in core enterprises, that's where we've been able to sort of cross that chasm from a P times Q business over to a value sale business, and we are able to start to get more automation and workflows in place there as well."",
  ""So, it's a mix of these things."",
  ""We are going to continue to balance."",
  ""And we believe that proliferation, as we've said for some time, maintains – is one of the top priorities because we know that if people start using our products today, we have the opportunity to continue to deliver value for a long time to come."",
  ""And so that balance is what we try to do and it's a management judgment call, but we think we're getting it right."",
  ""Black Friday, Cyber Monday played out about as expected."",
  ""We've been talking about a multi-year trend where commercial activity is shifting left in terms of timing."",
  ""We run our promotions over a larger window of time to reflect consumer behavior, and we see a similar pattern commercially from our customers this year that we've seen in prior years."",
  ""If we think about online shopping this year, up 8.4%."",
  ""You can see last year, that's up from 4.8%, so a nice step-up this year versus last year."",
  ""But you can see Cyber Monday from a contribution standpoint, even though the growth last year was down relative to this year, Cyber Monday grew at 9.6%, this year at 7.3%, just illustrates the flattening of the profile and consumer behavior around that."",
  ""Yeah, I think Document Cloud has been – if you think about the fact that we're 40 years into this business, it's really just the foundation is the fact that PDF has become the de facto standard for unstructured data in the world."",
  ""And Adobe and Acrobat are the most trusted providers of solutions for that."",
  ""And that's really what is the foundation of what is driving the business, including the fact that it's the most secure platform for leveraging and accessing the content."",
  ""I think what is – there are two things that are really the growth drivers of this business or a number of things."",
  ""First is exactly like you said, I mean, monthly active users and free and paid is a key stat that we keep looking at."",
  ""We are very effective at taking free users of Reader and converting them to paid users of Acrobat."",
  ""And we continue to do that across more surfaces that used to be predominantly a focus on desktop applications."",
  ""As we've noted in the past, we now have Edge integrations and Chrome integrations."",
  ""We're also available in Teams."",
  ""We're also available on mobile devices for iOS and Android, and the mix of all of those continue to grow on a monthly basis."",
  ""One of the things that we are doing to drive that growth is helping people see the value of sharing a link to the PDF as opposed to sharing the document itself that in doing so, you get a lot more control in terms of the conversation and feedback and review around that."",
  ""But it also drives the fact that the recipient is then guaranteed to be viewing the PDF in an Adobe surface that we can then use to close that viral loop and drive further top-of-funnel opportunity to convert."",
  ""So, that foundation is very strong."",
  ""In addition to that, AI Assistant has been really a phenomenal add."",
  ""Unlike many other players in this space, we don't require significant security and governance reviews, because people can have conversations around the documents that they view."",
  ""And one of the big things that I think has been unlocked this year is moving, not just by looking at a PDF that you happen to be viewing, but being able to look at and have a conversation with multiple documents, some of which don't even have to be PDFs."",
  ""So, that transition and that gives us the ability to really take Acrobat and make it more of a general purpose productivity platform, and that's really what drove the adoption that we saw in education this year."",
  ""So, that's another way of saying that the core foundation of Acrobat continues to be strong and is actually getting stronger with MAU increasing."",
  ""But the new value we're adding with AI Assistant takes Acrobat to an entire new level in terms of value."",
  ""So, a number of things."",
  ""So, first of all, you're exactly right in terms of Firefly is a platform and a foundation that we're leveraging across many different products."",
  ""As we talked about, everything from Express and Lightroom and even in Acrobat on mobile for a broad base, but then also in our core Creative products, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere."",
  ""And as we've alluded to a number of times on this call, with the introduction of video, even a stand-alone offer for Firefly that we think will be more valuable from a tiering perspective there, and then into Firefly Services through APIs and connection to GenStudio."",
  ""So, we are looking at leveraging the power of this AI foundation in all the activities."",
  ""Now, as it relates to top of funnel and conversion, we're very excited."",
  ""Let's start with new users and more closer to the low end of the market."",
  ""We're very excited with the signal we're getting from Express and Lightroom on mobile and web."",
  ""Again, as we've talked about, Express is seeing some really good new user acquisition."",
  ""We added 4,000 new businesses this year."",
  ""We increased education access by 84% this back-to-school versus last back-to-school."",
  ""We're seeing really strong adoption through social, digital and mobile traffic as well."",
  ""So, we see that when we invest in mobile and web, we are getting some very positive signals in terms of user adoption and user conversion rate."",
  ""So, we're using Firefly very actively to do that."",
  ""And by the way, the fact that Firefly continues to be the only commercially safe model integrated into these apps does matter when it comes to, as I said, adding 4,000 new businesses."",
  ""The second thing is we are seeing in the core Creative business, when people try something like Photoshop, the onboarding experience is faster to success because of the use of generative AI and generative capabilities."",
  ""So, you'll start to see us continuing to drive more proliferation of those capabilities earlier in the user journeys, and that has been proven very productive."",
  ""But we also noticed that more people use generative AI."",
  ""Again, we've always had good retention rates, but the more people use generative AI, the longer they retain as well."",
  ""And so we are definitely leveraging generative AI for that entire flow in the funnel."",
  ""As we pass the top of the hour, we just have time for one more question."",
  ""And what I definitely don't want to do is get into guiding of cRPO."",
  ""But when I take a step back and think about the rhythm and flow of the business, what we're seeing on the enterprise side, winning large transformational deals, exiting the year with the largest bookings quarter ever, having premium tiers in that product portfolio, momentum around AEP and apps continuing to grow at scale."",
  ""Now, when we think about content supply chain and bringing cross-cloud opportunities together that really get at meaningful pain points of customers over time and then we think about the innovation that we're driving through the Digital Media business, I feel really good about our ability to continue to drive the business going forward and I'm very encouraged by what I see."",
  ""And then just adding on briefly to the question on tiering."",
  ""Yeah, Jay, it's – if you think about where we – what we've done over the last year, there's been a bit of experimentation, obviously, in the core Creative applications."",
  ""We've done the generative credits model."",
  ""What we saw with Acrobat was this idea of a separate package and a separate SKU that created a tier that people were able to access the feature through."",
  ""And as we learn from all of these, we think, as Shantanu had mentioned earlier, that the right tiering model for us is going to be a combination of feature, access to certain features and usage limits on it."",
  ""So, the higher the tier, the more features you get and the more usage you get of it."",
  "" and that ends this call.""

35,2914125,0N9MCC-E,2024-12-10,"[
  ""Hi, everyone, and  for joining the Moonpig Group half-year results question-and-answer session."",
  ""Hopefully, you've had a chance to look through the announcement and to watch the presentation video."",
  ""I'll just say a few words and then, we will move quickly to Q&A. It's been another good period for the group, with the Moonpig brand driving both top line and bottom line growth, reinforcing our long-term ability to deliver consistently."",
  ""Moonpig itself saw another half of double-digit growth, supported by an expanding customer base, higher purchase frequency, and an increased attach rate."",
  ""At our Greetz business, the revenue profile continues to improve, with a 4% decline in the half, equivalent to a 2% decline on a constant currency basis, getting closer to the – to growth."",
  ""The overall growth is driving operating leverage throughout the business, with EBITDA margins exceeding our medium-term target levels and driving a 9% increase in PBT."",
  ""The transformation in our Experience business is progressing at pace."",
  ""However, the challenging macro environment has extended the timeframe for realizing the full growth potential of the business."",
  ""And as a result, today, we're recognizing a non-cash impairment charge on that business."",
  ""The overall cash generation of the group, however, continues to be extremely strong."",
  ""And in line with our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, today, we're announcing our inaugural interim dividend of £0.01 alongside the ongoing £25 million share buyback program."",
  ""The growth we're seeing at Moonpig is a direct result of the investments we have made in data and technology over the last few years, with features such as Moonpig Plus, our reminders, and our creative features now consistently driving the lifetime value of all of our customers higher every period."",
  ""We continue to make progress in new markets with limited investment."",
  ""We saw a 42% growth across Ireland, Australia, and the US."",
  ""And our adoption of AI throughout the organization continues, and just last week, we had the exciting release of our new AI handwriting tool, a world first, where customers can create a digital version of their own handwriting, and I encourage you all to try it and let us know how it is."",
  ""So, whilst the macro climate remains challenging, Moonpig Group continues to demonstrate growth, profitability, and cash generation, and we're confident in the long-term prospects of this business."",
  ""We maintain our full-year revenue growth target of mid-to high-single digits, and in the medium term, we expect to deliver consistent double-digit revenue growth."",
  ""Today, we're upgrading our medium-term target range for EBITDA margins to between 25% and 27%, and this will support sustained mid-teens EPS growth."",
  ""With that, I'll turn over to questions.""
]","[
  ""Morning, guys, and  for taking my questions."",
  ""Wonder if maybe we could just kick off with a bit of thinking about the revenue bridge for H2."",
  ""Greetz, I guess, if we start there, clear that you're seeing a sort of sequential improvement, back to minus 2% on a constant currency basis."",
  ""I guess, from your kind of – your current point of view, does it feel like it's realistic that we expect that business gets back to positive territory for the full year or actually, are we looking at kind of just a sequential improvement getting back to a growth into 2026?"",
  ""And then, I suppose, just on the – making sure I'm clear in terms of the phasing of the Experiences business and the COVID voucher cancellation, you guided to a mid-single digit impact for the full year, £3.2 million of that, I think, you called out as coming in the first half."",
  ""So, assume we should be expecting something similar in H2."",
  ""And then, I guess, the final part is kind of Moonpig and how we should be thinking about momentum in that business."",
  ""So, obviously, the comp steps up materially into H2."",
  ""Are you seeing this near-term against this kind of backdrop as a consistent double-digit growth business or should we be maybe tampering our expectations there?"",
  ""I will get back in the queue."",
  ""First one on Moonpig gross margin, more Moonpig brand gross margin."",
  ""You sort of talked to quite a few factors that are supporting that Moonpig Plus supply/marketing income, so on and so on."",
  ""Just wondering which have been the most significant in that sort of bridge and what the outlook looking further ahead is?"",
  ""Because, I mean, if you think about some of those Moonpig Plus, in particular and the commission on some of those gift categories, which sound like they could be growing, feels like there could be opportunity – further opportunity on that in outer years."",
  ""So, that's a first one around Moonpig gross margin."",
  ""Then, obviously, looking on the Experiences side of the business, I mean, the way you discussed it in the statement it sounds like you're sort of talking about it purely as a sort of cyclical effect."",
  ""But, I guess, trying to dig a bit below that, is the business fundamentally what you thought it was or are there some other challenges on the impairment?"",
  ""I know it's more symbolic than anything else, but, I guess, the question really, should we be worried about it?"",
  ""A couple for me, please."",
  ""Firstly, do you have plans to move any of the other categories to the agency model, which could benefit gross margin in the future, whether for the Moonpig business or and I don't know whether it has been tried already in the Greetz business at all or is there scope to do that in the Greetz business as well?"",
  ""And the second question, if you could break down the improvement in the performance of the Greetz business in terms of whether it's been driven more by growing the active customer base, getting more new customers in, average order value or frequency."",
  ""Just two quick ones for me, please."",
  ""First of all, just on the Greetz gross margin, I think there was some extra promo activity going in there in the half."",
  ""Can you maybe just talk a little bit about whether that's the same sort of promotions that you historically have used at different times for the Moonpig brand or if that's something different there, just be good to understand?"",
  ""And then, also, just in terms of the medium-term guidance for a double-digit top line, is that something that you would anticipate achieving next year or is that more something that we should anticipate that you'd be achieving on kind of a one-to three-year view?"",
  ""How should we be thinking about that, please?"",
  ""Can you hear me okay?"",
  ""Hello, can you hear me?"",
  ""I was just saying, in terms of Moonpig Plus, obviously you've had success getting up to 750,000 subscribers."",
  ""And I think you mentioned about one in five transactions going with it."",
  ""Where do you think kind of the targeted long-term for that?"",
  ""What do you think is a reasonable kind of share to get to versus your customers in terms of subscribers?"",
  ""And just in terms of behavior of subscribers."",
  ""You talked before about kind of increase in transactions."",
  ""Are you also seeing kind of that higher attach rate, and particularly, in Experiences, are you seeing kind of stronger performance there?"",
  ""So, can Moonpig Plus be something that helps kind of drive that Experience growth that you're looking for?"",
  ""I hope you can hear me?"",
  ""Can I just quickly ask about the gifting ranges as you sort of go into your sort of – into the Christmas period?"",
  ""Are you still saying that the £10, £15 range is about right?"",
  ""If you have to make any sort of tweaks for that?"",
  ""And then next question is sort of the key – the experiments that you run on sort of a microcosm of your customer base."",
  ""What are the next ones that you're sort of looking at?"",
  ""How are you thinking about these?"",
  ""And then final question is, can you just please remind me how the cost base for your international business has worked?"",
  ""Is it still about sort of 10% is onshore and 90% is offshore?"",
  "" both so, so much."",
  "" for taking a second question from me."",
  ""Just on, one, which is a follow-up from an earlier question on Moonpig Plus."",
  ""Clearly, a very interesting customer base that you have, you're creating there, you're building there."",
  ""It'd probably be very interesting for your partners as well, something like in the toys category for Entertainer."",
  ""Are you testing maybe bringing another tier or at least thinking about bringing another tier to that subscription scheme, which gives people access to maybe a discounted range of gifting as well?"",
  ""I'll take the point on Greetz, Andy can talk through Experiences and Moonpig, I mean."",
  ""So, I think on the Greetz side, what we've seen over the last two years is a very consistent improvement in the sort of the revenue trajectory."",
  ""So, we've kind of said this a couple of times, but if you go back for the last four halves, we've gone from minus 20% to minus 10% to minus 5% and this half obviously to minus 2% on a – in euros."",
  ""I think the point here is that, actually, what we're seeing is, Greetz continues to follow the path of Moonpig with a lag and that lag is driven for two reasons."",
  ""The first reason is just simply that Greetz moved on to the group platform about 18 months later than Moonpig."",
  ""And so, only really the loyalty benefits and the true kind of flywheel of the business it works because of the platform because of what the platform allows us to do in terms of capturing data, using those data to build customer loyalty and improved personalization."",
  ""So, Greetz just started that journey later."",
  ""But the second point is that, actually, the way that the platform delivers value is essentially by capturing that data and our data science models seeding those – seeding kind of each country with the data from that particular country and over time optimizing the experience for those customers."",
  ""And so, naturally at Greetz, given it's about a quarter of the size of Moonpig, it takes roughly four times longer for those algorithms to get up to speed just because of the smaller amounts of data points that we have in the smaller business."",
  ""And so, kind of it's taking longer for Greetz to catch up."",
  ""But what was really important to us is that we just – we continue to see that consistent improvement in the business and that's something that we're focused on delivering."",
  ""And so, kind of, I guess, if you look at kind of where the trajectory is now, it kind of – you can kind of extrapolate where we should be in the end of this year and certainly moving into next year."",
  ""Andy, do you want to talk...   I think the answer is no."",
  ""I mean, I think, this is – the strategic rationale for buying the business remains exactly the same as it was, and we kind of obviously talked about that at the CMD in October."",
  ""I think we knew this was going to be a full transformation of the business to really sort of unlock higher growth potential."",
  ""We didn't know we'd be doing it in sort of two years of challenging macro conditions."",
  ""When we look at actually just the wider market, so the gifting market, we think that actually there is still a sort of a global megatrend away from material gift towards experiential gifting."",
  ""And actually, the sort of the unique characteristics that our businesses have in terms of how we can package those gifts up to the customer in a way that gives them a delightful experience, flexibility, peace of mind, and kind of an ability to cross-sell, upsell, I think, is, again, something that no one else can do other than sort of gift experience aggregators, of which we're the largest."",
  ""And so, I think the sort of strategic rationale and the assets of the business remain absolutely intact."",
  ""I think the point for us that we probably – we're kind of leaning into now is that we've completed the operational transformation, which was just kind of the ways of working and the team structure internally."",
  ""We replatformed the tech platform, that's delivered a huge amount of value, which we think is the main driver of why we believe we've outperformed the wider market over the last year or so and that will continue now to deliver value."",
  ""But the third part is, actually, now looking to really evolve the range of products."",
  ""And I think that's something that actually having a new platform allows us to be much more agile now in the way that we think about adapting our range so that we're really selling products that are very relevant for the customer today."",
  ""And I think the point is, when you're in a sort of changing external macro climate, customer preferences are changing."",
  ""Some of those might be long-term changes."",
  ""People are – people weren't going on axe-throwing parties in the evenings five years ago, right?"",
  ""So – but customer behaviors do change over time."",
  ""But also just allows us to sort of move into different categories."",
  ""So, moving into lower price points, which means we push more into gourmet."",
  ""So, the launch of Slug and Lettuce and other sort of casual dining brands has been really successful moving into subscription products, which didn't really exist kind of from a digital enablement perspective a few years ago, moving into those – moving into the immersive experiences."",
  ""And so, I think now the focus for that business is, we've got the platform, we've got the team."",
  ""It's about actually how do we now really evolve the range and then how do we package and market that range to sort of pull customers in and to excite them again."",
  ""And that's a journey that we're going on and we're confident that we can – we'll make the progress and that will deliver value for us."",
  ""And I think, in the meantime, the value of the sort of the revenue synergies between the two business continues to grow at a really exciting pace."",
  ""And so, there are more and more Moonpig customers every day adding gift experiences to their cards."",
  ""And I think we're still scratching the surface of kind of making that a great experience and a great range."",
  ""And so, that's, again, a big driver of the business going forward."",
  ""Do you want to take the first, Andy, and I'll take the second?"",
  ""And then, on Greetz, I think if you look at sort of the three drivers of the business, customer growth is pretty healthy."",
  ""So, we're seeing new customers coming through the business, which kind of gives us confidence at the marketing strategy, the relevance of the product, and the platform that we offer is working."",
  ""So, we're bringing new customers in at kind of very encouraging levels."",
  ""Frequency hasn't – it's kind of probably where there's a bit of a delta from the Moonpig business, and it's kind of to what I spoke about earlier, which is that point on, actually, we're waiting for sort of the loyalty drivers to kick in, and there's just a lag because there's a sort of annual lag when customers are taking actions and kind of when they come back the following year and that's when the sort of the loyalty model really kicks in."",
  ""But there's also just a lag on the data science models and the algorithms being seeded with enough data to optimize every part of that experience and that's a journey that we're on."",
  ""So, as those things kick in, we're just confident that the platform will deliver just like it is now doing in the UK."",
  ""On the third driver of the business, average order value, there's kind of a – there's sort of a nuance with Greetz that actually – when we look at – we look at the business from sort of two lenses."",
  ""We have a very clear card-first lens, which is when a customer comes in, they choose their card, they design their card, and then they add a gift."",
  ""And that's our core model."",
  ""That's what Moonpig business is built around."",
  ""And on that front, we're seeing really encouraging trends at Greetz."",
  ""So, kind of card orders being strong and people attaching gifts to those cards at increasing rates."",
  ""What you have in Greetz, though, is you still – we still have a legacy kind of business or legacy customer behavior of gift-first buying."",
  ""And this is something that kind of we inherited when we bought the business five – six years ago where Greetz has kind of made a push into gift-first sales."",
  ""And so, a lot of customers – Greetz customers, the older customers will start with a gift and then maybe add a card almost as a gift note, and that doesn't drive the loyalty and the compounding cohorts that we want to drive in this business."",
  ""So, it's not something we proactively push."",
  ""So, what we see is, we see that gift-first business in pretty steady decline, the card-first business in growth, and there's a sort of transition period."",
  ""And what that means is that our overall kind of average order value and kind of attach rate optically looks worse even though the strategic value is growing."",
  ""And so, that's probably the biggest delta when you look at the growth rates between the UK and Greetz are in that kind of basket size and that's really primarily because you've got the sort of the legacy gift-first customer base in Greetz continuing to decline."",
  ""I'll take the first, Andy take the second."",
  ""The – yeah, so I think the promotional activity in Greetz in the past year, I think we're relatively dynamic on this front."",
  ""So, it's kind of it's more reactive to market conditions, to competition, and the environment – the sort of the macro picture and the political picture in the Netherlands hasn't – again hasn't been particularly supportive this year."",
  ""And obviously, Greetz is not quite at the level we want it to be, it's improving, but we'd kind of love to see that business back in growth."",
  ""And so, there is – where we've been kind of more proactive on promotions is really trying to drive behaviors from customers that we know will deliver for us in the future."",
  ""So, for example, being more aggressive on moving customers to the app with a discount, being more aggressive and giving new customers their first card for 50% off or for free, and likewise being reasonably aggressive on a promotional level once a new customer signs up of then encouraging them to buy that second card within the first two weeks, and almost we'll give that card for free if – for them to come back for the second time because we know what that does to their long-term lifetime value."",
  ""And so, that's kind of where we've been pushing quite hard on the Greetz side."",
  ""Another area is partnerships, where we didn't do that many external partnerships and that's something we're really switching on."",
  ""So, for example, just this week, we've got a partnership going live with Vodafone in the Netherlands, where all Vodafone customers will get one Greetz Christmas card included as part of their subscription."",
  ""And, again, it's a great way to bring new customers on board, but, obviously, increases the short-term promotional levels of the business."",
  ""But we're doing it because we believe it will pay back in long-term lifetime value."",
  ""So, I'll give an update and Andy can kind of talk to the medium-term piece."",
  ""So, I think starting with Moonpig for Work, we, obviously, sort of gave a demo of that six weeks ago or so – that business is – it remains in sort of private mode with kind of a select group of customers that we're kind of getting constant feedback on where we kind of – we've launched version two of it to them, the feedback's been better."",
  ""But there's still like a few features that we want to build before it's kind of ready to release to the sort of the wider public or the wider market."",
  ""And so, version three will – internally, we've got 3.0, we'll probably launch some point in January."",
  ""And that's probably the point at which we'll kind of expand it to a larger kind of customer base and start monetizing it."",
  ""But, again, it's going to be very small scale this year, wouldn't expect it to impact the P&L in any way this year and still be reasonably limited next year."",
  ""But the feedback is very good."",
  ""We're getting very positive feedback from the customer."",
  ""Just to sort of illustrate one of the features that we think we want to build in the next month or so before we release is actually a lot of customers want to use this for work anniversary cards, so sending someone  for two years at Berenberg,  for the five years at Berenberg."",
  ""And actually being able to automatically change the front design of the card, so the number changes dynamically."",
  ""Just those are the sort of features that we think are important rather than having to buy everyone's first anniversary and second anniversary card separately."",
  ""So, there's just some more features we're introducing."",
  ""But those, again, they should be live mid-January and then we'll kind of see if it's ready to release."",
  ""On the international side, I think, no major change from what we spoke about a couple of months ago, where we've got three markets that kind of are all growing quite nicely."",
  ""Ireland kind of moving almost to maturity stage where it's growing at a healthy growth rate, but it's profitable growth, it's delivering EBITDA, and we're reinvesting that EBITDA back into Australia and the US, and we think Ireland is just a market that continues to grow healthily where we have pretty strong market position and have had a great sort of run in the last couple of years."",
  ""Australia, every month we are getting closer to that sort of magical product market fit point and that's the point in which we can profitably acquire customers and know that they will payback and kind of, obviously, ramping up into the Christmas peak in Australia, we're kind of looking at our year-on-year cost of customer acquisition and those, again, are down year-on-year."",
  ""So, just continuing to make progress."",
  ""And I think it's really – what we really see now is that, actually, Australia is now at the point where we are kind of annualizing marketing activity from last year."",
  ""We started sort of last August, September was the first time we put any real effort into that market."",
  ""And as you start to annualize, as customers can sort of activate their reminders, as sort of the brand awareness has kind of an annual impact, we've seen that kind of step down in customer acquisition costs kind of which is really encouraging for us."",
  ""The US, we're in year one."",
  ""We're very much in the testing phase."",
  ""I think everyone will know it's a big market."",
  ""So, we're taking it slowly, we're taking it carefully."",
  ""We're just testing lots of different channels to see if there's something that we can look to scale and find a way to product market fit, but we're a long way from that."",
  ""We can hear you now."",
  ""I think we are doing quite a bit of work on this internally."",
  ""We don't have a sort of a long-term target to share."",
  ""I think the key thing for us was obviously getting through the first year and just making sure that actually the subscription worked for us, but also worked for our customers."",
  ""And what we saw in sort of that first year was every customer saved money, which is great, so – for them."",
  ""But also we made – every customer was more valuable to us because the subscription fee plus the additional cards that they bought and the additional gifts they bought more than offset the discount the kind of they got."",
  ""And so, it was kind of a win-win for us and them and that's what's driven pretty good – very good, actually, I'd say, renewal rates into year two, and therefore, continued growth in the base."",
  ""The sort of the next piece is actually to see well what happens to customer behavior in year two."",
  ""And actually, does that continue to – does frequency increase again or does it remain stable or does it kind of actually fall back down?"",
  ""And that's something that we are – we're monitoring very closely."",
  ""We've got the first few cohorts of renewals, we can now start to see those that early data, but it's still a bit too early for us to draw the conclusion."",
  ""And we really need to know what year two behavior is."",
  ""So, before we can sort of start to sort of extrapolate what does the sort of three, four, five year model of this look like."",
  ""The sort of the big question that we have internally and we haven't answered this question yet, we need more data and more time to be able to answer it is probably where your question is going."",
  ""Does this remain a product which is sort of 5%, 10% of our customer base, delivering 20%, 30%, 40% of orders or if could subscriptions be a more core part where it's maybe half our customer base delivering 80% or 90% of orders."",
  ""I think we're still very much in the former camp at the moment."",
  ""That's the way this is going."",
  ""But we're constantly reviewing it to see, is there more we can do."",
  ""And we're aware that there are many businesses out there that have started with a simple subscription scheme and then launched tiers to try and make sure every customer gets on it."",
  ""And there are other businesses that haven't, the big ones, the Amazon, the Ubers which have one scheme and that's what they work on."",
  ""So, we are constantly reviewing it, but as things stand, we're very happy with the fact that our best customers are joining this and they're saving money."",
  ""We're making more and that's a win-win situation, which I think is something we want to maintain."",
  ""So, Moonpig Plus customers kind of naturally tend to be our better customers in terms of – so from a frequency perspective, just given it makes more sense to sign up if you buy more cards."",
  ""So, they tend to be – and actually those customers do have a slightly higher attach rate on average than customers that aren't signing up."",
  ""And so, what's been really good to see is that as the – as Moonpig customers have signed up and bought and their frequency is lifted, their attach rate has remained exactly the same."",
  ""So, what we have is kind of an uplift of frequency at a higher attach rate, which helps the attach rate mix."",
  ""And so, absolutely, Moonpig Plus is without it being a scheme that encourages gifting, it's a very much a card frequency membership scheme and – but it is indirectly also supporting group attach rate, which is great."",
  ""There isn't a huge link between sort of the Moonpig Plus subscription and the Experience sort of direct sales."",
  ""There is – one of the benefits of Moonpig Plus is you do get a discount on Experiences."",
  ""But, really, for us, the sales of our Experience business are primarily driven through those websites via gift.co.uk and redletterdays.co.uk and those aren't linked to the Moonpig customer base subscription at the moment."",
  ""I'll take the first two and Andy can touch on the third."",
  ""So, in terms of the gifting range, I think the average gift is in the £15 to £20 price point actually."",
  ""I think there was a period a couple of years ago where we were seeing stronger growth in the sub £15 price point, but that's probably no longer the case."",
  ""I think what's really been just good to see is actually like it's the quality of the product and the brand that drives the sales, not necessarily the price point."",
  ""And so we saw earlier this year when we launched Hotel Chocolat kind of jumped to sort of top of the charts in terms of our internal gifting brand sales, even though it's obviously significantly more premium than Lindt and Cadbury's, which have always been very good sellers for us."",
  ""And so, the right product will sell."",
  ""And then on the flipside, I think, what we've seen is with the launch of the Early Learning Centre and The Entertainer brands, where our toy range and our kids range has just exponentially improved just overnight sort of since October and through November."",
  ""You have the right products, and so, we've seen gift attach for kids grow."",
  ""And actually products, LEGO and Paw Patrol, and Peppa Pig, and these sort of toys that – Play-Doh, all these toys, that range, they do tend to be lower price point toys because a lot of them are in the sort of £10 to £12 to £14 price point."",
  ""So, really, for us it's – we're much less focused on driving on sort of actually trying to target price points."",
  ""I think it's about you have the right product and customers will buy it."",
  ""And so, we're just – we're trying to continuously improve the range, whether that is at high price points or low price points."",
  ""And, obviously, in making sure that we have a good spread for every customer."",
  ""In terms of experiments, I mean, we – I think we're doing probably sort of the 20 to 30 sort of experiments a month."",
  ""So it's sort of – it's a difficult thing for us to sort of run through all of them."",
  ""I think in terms of the – some of the sort of the larger ones we're doing, I think, one of those is the launch of handwriting."",
  ""So, we've just launched that last week."",
  ""And so, that is something we're going to be monitoring very closely to see how our customers engaging with it."",
  ""Is it delivering what they want?"",
  ""And how can we iterate on that?"",
  ""So, that's something we're launching."",
  ""AI sticker as we talked about, that's coming very soon, hopefully in the next week or so, where customers will be able to create their own stickers."",
  ""Again, just, I think, adding something that is a unique feature that's no one else does."",
  ""And can really improve the sort of the impact of a card if you In terms of sort of some of the more intelligent features, I guess, there's sort of a larger upgrade coming to our search capabilities in the next kind of two months."",
  ""I think kind of at some point in the end of January we're targeting to release, which is a feature called And And probably the last one I'd say is something that we've just launched, but something that we're looking to sort of the grow is, is called Magic Link, which is kind of a – it's a way that if you – now, so when customers receive a reminder from us, previously, if you clicked on a reminder, e-mail or push notification – or e-mail in particular and you weren't logged into the website, it would take you to the log in page and it would say, please log in and you need to type in your username and password, which is a bit of friction."",
  ""Now, it will automatically log you in when you click on that reminder link."",
  ""And so, it's kind of it removes a huge amount of friction."",
  ""And because you're logged in, obviously, the experience is a lot more personalized."",
  ""And so, that's something I think we launched sort of to a small group of customers a couple of weeks ago, and I think we're pretty confident that's going to have a big impact in terms of reducing friction."",
  ""So, those are just a couple of examples."",
  ""But, like I said, we're doing about 20, 25 a month."",
  ""And so there's lots coming and sometimes we're very surprised by the ones that have great customer impact and sometimes we are disappointed by things we thought would be fantastic and aren't."",
  ""So, yeah, every – depending on which week you speak to us, we can always talk about which features have worked and which haven't."",
  ""So, at the moment, we're not."",
  ""It's kind of – do we discuss it internally?"",
  ""But, I think there's something really important in the way we try and run the business, which is simplicity and just trying to keep things as simple as possible."",
  ""So, whether that's pricing or whether that's choice, whether that's the subscription scheme."",
  ""I think, we've looked at other businesses which kind of have Plus and then Pro and then Premium and then Gold and Silver and Elite and it gets reasonably confusing for the customer."",
  ""And we think actually that's when subscription schemes can go wrong and not to mention the complexity of managing it internally."",
  ""And so, I think from our side, what we've done is we've – for now we've launched a scheme which really we think is kind of can generate the most value with a single scheme for the widest part of our customer base."",
  ""And I think if we change that it'll be a pretty big decision, but it'd be one that we'd want to test."",
  ""I think probably the one thing I would just say, though, is the benefits of the existing scheme are not fixed."",
  ""And so we've over time, over the last year or so, we have – we've changed and we've added to those benefits."",
  ""So, not only do you get a 30% discount on cards, when you sign up, but you do also get a free post card every month."",
  ""There is now a range of, I think, 300 or 400 cards, which are £2 for the card."",
  ""And so, it's a 50% off range."",
  ""And so, actually, a lot of our Plus customers just use Plus to buy cards from that range."",
  ""You can personalize those cards, there're some great designs there."",
  ""And so, there's no reason why we can't – we've tested to our Plus customers doing a bouquet of the month."",
  ""So, every month there's a different flower bouquet they can buy at 50% off."",
  ""And so, I think there are other ways to do this that don't require changing the tier."",
  ""But give a benefit to our customers and potentially those could be supplier funded things with The Entertainer, so those we will explore."",
  ""I mean, I guess, if we – if you look at it, you can see the number of active customers we have."",
  ""You can see that we have 750,000 Moonpig Plus subscribers and each of them has kind of increased their frequency by about 20%."",
  ""So, you can kind of do the math."",
  ""It's clearly contributing pretty positively to sort of overall frequency."",
  ""As Andy mentioned, the group frequency number that we report is obviously influenced by the sort of the proportion of new customers in that active base, because new customers naturally have a lower frequency in their first year than customers that come back."",
  ""So – but, yeah, but the Moonpig Plus continues to add – yeah to add value."",
  ""Renewal rates, we talked about when we sort of launched a scheme that our business case and baseline expectations were that roughly 50% of customers would renew because we think that sort of the global benchmark for subscription schemes."",
  ""What we've seen from June consistently every week since June, so now kind of almost six months of cohorts is it's consistently been significantly higher kind of just north of two-thirds of customers are renewing."",
  ""And there's probably more we can do to sort of even further increase that."",
  ""So, yeah, very happy with renewal rates of Plus."",
  ""So, on the first question, well, I think we've probably covered that already, but, yeah, I mean, we're happy with the scheme."",
  ""Like we said, it's a win for the customer and it's a win from us."",
  ""And I think that is – that kind of is the magic ingredients that kind of make it a good subscription scheme and that customers will stick with."",
  ""I think on gift experiences, the marketing – so just maybe to clarify, so Moonpig's card-first acquisition strategy doesn't apply to Experiences."",
  ""Experiences is – as you would expect, is an experience first and experience only gift sale."",
  ""I think really that the point for us is this kind of third piece of the transformation, which is making sure we have the right proposition for what customers want is all about do we have the right products?"",
  ""Are those products on trend?"",
  ""Are those products at the right price point?"",
  ""Are those products playing into sort of what's topical in the market and what's – what people – what customers want to do and want to gift?"",
  ""And are we able to present those and package those in a way that's exciting?"",
  ""And so, I think that now means there's work on both the sort of the range building side, there's work on the merchandising side, and there's work on the marketing side to make sure we're doing that."",
  ""And I think one of the things that we've really thought about is, it kind of it feels like gift experiences are inherently suited to being a product that you could make exciting through social channels."",
  ""It's like should this be a TikTok – should TikTok or Meta being an exciting channel for us."",
  ""I think it should, because I think the whole point of Experiences is there're exciting things that you do with people, with friends and family."",
  ""And I think we really don't tap into that now."",
  ""We're still pretty reliant on Google and kind of search and intent."",
  ""So, I think as the product becomes more exciting and more relevant over time, there's an opportunity for us to sort of revisit how we market these products as well."",
  ""And, ultimately, what is important for us to build the long-term sustainable business that we set out to build two years ago through experience is absolutely that we need to reduce our dependence on Google and we need to make sure we can increase our kind of direct traffic or loyalty from customers and we do that by building brand."",
  ""And there's probably a different marketing approach needed for that."",
  "" for the great questions."",
  ""And, yeah, we will see you again at the full year results in June."",
  ""Have a lovely Christmas....the other points."",
  ""Your second point was on Experiences and breakage in the prior year and it's £5.9 million for the full year."",
  ""So, £3.2 million in H1 and it was up £2.7 million in H2."",
  ""So, in the second half of the year, you'll see a similar effect, whereby there is some headline annualization against prior-year breakage."",
  ""And I think your third question was around Moonpig, and we are – we're sort of really pleased with the composition of the growth that we've seen in Moonpig in the first half of the year, and we expect that momentum to continue with a probably similar level of growth in the second half of the year."",
  ""So, maybe staying in double-digit growth."",
  ""I think, in particular, we're pleased by the fact that we're seeing robust growth in orders with both new customer acquisition and frequency in growth."",
  ""And, obviously, you do have an effect whereby in a period where new customer acquisition is strong, that can be driving frequency because in a new customer cohort you do see sort of lower than average frequency."",
  ""So, having both of those in growth is good from our perspective."",
  ""And then, on average order value, you've obviously got the fact that, as in the first half of the year, there's been some support for average order value from first class stamp price increases, which we passed through."",
  ""And then, actually, we have seen a strengthening in attach rate through the first half of the year, and we expect that trend to continue into the second half."",
  ""So, yeah, as you say sort of a strong half performance in terms of Moonpig gross margin, and actually, it's broadly evenly balanced between each of those drivers."",
  ""So, we've seen good performance from our commercial teams in terms of just the basics of supply negotiation."",
  ""We've seen a good contribution from our operations team in terms of operational efficiencies and the in-sourcing of certain projects, including moving the fulfillment balloons from a third party into our Tamworth... ...facility."",
  ""And we have seen a benefit from sort of the 100% margin streams."",
  ""The uptick in gross margin, in particular, sort of comes from the move of The Entertainer and our toys range from an acting as principal to an acting as agent, and therefore, we're recognizing commission... ...100% of revenue rather than sort of GTV."",
  ""So, that's obviously a bit of a drag in terms of AOV growth, which is positive for gross profit."",
  ""Probably, one thing I would call out is on the – on all of the Plus subscriptions is positive for gross margin."",
  ""You actually also have the sort of that accounted by the fact that we are therefore offering discounts to Plus members, and one in five of orders from the Moonpig brand now is through the Plus subscription scheme."",
  ""And, obviously, you do have a bit of a counterweight there."",
  ""Overall – I mean, I would certainly expect that the gross profit improvement that we've seen in the first half of the year will be sustained in the second half of the year."",
  ""I think after that it will be down to us to drive further improvements to the margin improvement, but there's nothing that we have sort of scheduled at the moment."",
  ""So, certainly, in terms – you're right, so one of the changes in the past six months has been moving the toy category across onto a – onto sort of an agency model."",
  ""I suppose the point I'd make is that, that's not driven by the financials and some financial engineering is because we think that it's a really great way of improving our range in one of our key categories."",
  ""So, for customer purchase missions that involve children's toys, we've now got a specialist, which is merchandizing the range in our behalf."",
  ""It does actually give us some benefits in terms of sort of inventory management as well."",
  ""But it's not really about gross margin per se."",
  ""We are looking at other arrangements with other providers with different categories."",
  ""They could be on either a principal basis or an agent basis depending upon the specific arrangements that we've put in place with each category manager."",
  ""I suppose the point I would make is that really in terms of absolute gross profit it's sort of a net-net because you get a higher gross margin, but obviously, there's a drag in terms of average order value because you're not recognizing the GTV."",
  ""And then on your second question, Georgina, around medium-term guidance, the way I characterize it is that on the medium-term target for adjusted EBITDA margin rate, we'll be there very quickly."",
  ""So, my expectations would be that we're towards the top end of that range in the current financial year."",
  ""But on revenue growth, it will take us a period of years to get there."",
  ""So, obviously, you've got the Moonpig business is in double-digit growth, and to the comments sort of earlier on this call, we expect that to sustain into the second half of this year and beyond."",
  ""The Greetz is on a improving trajectory."",
  ""We've clearly got some work to do in terms of continuing the transformation plan within the Experiences business."",
  ""And on the point around medium-term guidance, we'd see it's being within our existing guidance both from a perspective of revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin rate."",
  ""So, the growth that we're getting is a contribution to our trajectory of medium-term revenue growth."",
  ""But equally that revenue growth is being funded through the – through our EBITDA margin without incremental investment."",
  ""I mean, clearly – and that's based on where we are in terms of the evolution of those brands and businesses at the moment."",
  ""Should you get to a point where we see very clear product market fit, then we could And then on the question around cost base."",
  ""So, I suppose the key thing is that our tech platform allows us to connect to third-party fulfillment partners and very quickly on an API basis."",
  ""And, as an example, in both Australia and the US, in the last six months, we've opened a second distribution facility in Sydney and in Las Vegas, respectively."",
  ""So, that means that, actually, the very sort of capital-light basis we can connect through the third-party to do the printing and the fulfillment for us and effectively operate in the sort of cost per unit basis."",
  ""And so, actually, all of the costs right down to gross profit and then marketing cost is effectively in the local markets."",
  ""And then all of the indirect costs effectively sits in the UK."",
  ""As a reminder, bootstrap is probably the word that sort of describes the approach to new markets the best."",
  ""So it's a handful of people based in London that are doing all of the work in the US, Australia, and Ireland."",
  ""And obviously, we leverage the existing technology platform."",
  ""So, the incremental costs in terms of tech are limited."",
  ""This is Gareth Davies from the finance team here at Moonpig."",
  ""We have a couple of questions."",
  ""Firstly, we have a single question from Karl Burns at Canaccord."",
  ""Which reads, what impact has the Moonpig Plus subscription had on group order frequency?"",
  ""And what do renewal rates look like?"",
  ""The second question, and there's no further written questions following this."",
  ""So, there's two questions from Matthew Evans at Equity Development with the first one reading."",
  ""The loyalty schemes are doing very well with around a fifth of Moonpig orders using Moonpig Plus."",
  ""Are you happy with both the level of discounts offered and with the return on investment that you are seeing?"",
  ""And then the second question reads, you've explained how gift experiences are taking longer to reach their potential."",
  ""How are you thinking about the marketing of gift experiences going forward, recognizing Moonpig's card-first acquisition strategy?"",
  ""Given there are no further questions, we shall hand back to Nickyl for closing remarks.""

  ""I think we have everybody in now."",
  ""So,  for joining this morning, everybody."",
  "" for joining the Snipp Interactive Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call."",
  ""I am Atul Sabharwal, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Snipp."",
  ""Joining me today is also Richard Pistilli, who recently took over as our Interim Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Jaisun Garcha couldn't make it today."",
  ""He will continue to support the company as we transition into next year and through our audit."",
  ""Please visit our Investor Relations site at snipp.com for a copy of our earnings press release and detailed financials which have also been filed on SEDAR."",
  ""We present all financial figures in US dollars unless otherwise indicated."",
  ""Before we proceed, I'd like to remind everyone that today's discussion may contain forward-looking statements."",
  ""These statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially."",
  ""So, let's start with a summary of the third quarter and key developments."",
  ""And the third quarter of 2024 marked a pivotal moment for Snipp."",
  ""We reported record EBITDA of $708,649 for the quarter, our highest ever."",
  ""This represents a significant milestone for the company, as it highlights the operational discipline and strategic focus that we've implemented over the past year."",
  ""It's also worth noting that this achievement comes on the heels of a $600,000 EBITDA loss in the first half of 2024, underscoring the pace of our turnaround."",
  ""Equally important is our margin improvement."",
  ""For the third quarter, gross margins surpassed 62%, up dramatically from 32% in the same period last year."",
  ""This improvement stems from our deliberate strategy to transition away from a single lower margin legacy contract."",
  ""Q3 revenue was $6.65 million, down 22% year-over-year."",
  ""Equally important is our margin improvement for the third quarter gross margin surpassed 62%, up dramatically from 32% in the same period last year."",
  ""This improvement stems from our deliberate strategy to transition away from a single lower margin legacy contract."",
  ""Q3 revenue was $6.65 million, down 22% year-over-year."",
  ""This decline was again solely driven by the termination of a single low-margin contract that continues to weigh on our year-to-date reported revenues."",
  ""Our core business remains very healthy and is comprised of high-margin revenue stemming from over 90-plus clients, many of whom are Fortune 1000 members."",
  ""That single contract was expected to sunset."",
  ""It has, and now our core growth is emerging as we have now completed the Gambit integration into our SnippCARE platform."",
  ""Looking at the first nine months of 2024, we achieved a positive EBITDA of $120,866, a strong improvement compared to $1.94 million loss in the same period last year."",
  ""Our bookings backlog also hit a new record $15.5 million as of September 30, 2024, compared to $14.5 million a year ago, setting the stage for sustained growth."",
  ""I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard Pistilli, Interim CFO, who will discuss our financials in more detail."",
  ""Let's move on to a bit of a strategic outlook."",
  ""Let's start, of course, with our costs in the business, which continued to have a strong quarter and healthy top line growth for the first nine months of the year."",
  ""Our updated investor presentation on our website should help shed some more light on our underlying strength in our core business on both the top and bottom lines."",
  ""More of our largest clients are increasing their spending on our solutions and we've had some new logo wins as well."",
  ""As we stated earlier, we ended the quarter with a record bookings backlog of close to $15.5 million."",
  ""For those following us closely on LinkedIn, they've seen us recently post the results from our proprietary Snipp 2024 Holiday Shopping Trends survey; have Senior Snipp leadership present at the Path to Purchase Institute and Digital Grocery Summit in Hamburg, Germany and the Digital Grocery Summit in Amsterdam; launch Holiday Digital Programs for Snickers, Tito's Vodka, Jim Beam, Kellogg's, Nestlé, Purina, Conagra, O'Reilly and Lego just to name drop a few key customers."",
  ""Our core business continues to thrive by focusing on high margin contracts and operational excellence."",
  ""We've achieved a seamless integration of Gambit into our infrastructure."",
  ""With all costs related to Gambit now behind us, it's fully positioned to contribute to our margin profile going forward."",
  ""Now, I want to take a moment to highlight performance and potential of SnippMedia, our financial media network."",
  ""This platform has been live with Bank of America for six months and was recently deployed on AmpliFi."",
  ""We haven't made an announcement about that yet."",
  ""It's a leading banking loyalty platform that serves over 250 regional banks across the US."",
  ""FMN, our financial media network is already delivering impressive results."",
  ""The platform currently reaches over 30 million monthly active users and is growing steadily."",
  ""In-store SKU level grocery offers are experiencing redemption rates of between 5% and 10%."",
  ""Active users clip six offers on average, redeeming two per shopping trip."",
  ""This performance demonstrates the scalability and effectiveness of our media platform."",
  ""Looking ahead, several other financial institutions, including Triple, who we have previously announced are already integrating for targeted deployments in 2025, further helping us to grow our audience of active users."",
  ""In closing, Q3 2024 represents a very successful quarter for Snipp."",
  ""We've emerged from a period of operational realignment and the results of our hard work are evident."",
  ""As we have one month left in traditionally our strongest quarter, I am pleased to report that Snipp will be EBITDA positive for the full year 2024, a significant achievement compared to both 2023 and the first half of this year."",
  ""This milestone reinforces our confidence as we enter 2025 with momentum."",
  "" to our team, partners and shareholders for their support."",
  ""We can now move to Q&A. If you have a question, can you raise your hand virtually or in the chat Ask Us a Question and we'd be happy to respond."",
  ""To build on what Atul has already mentioned, I'd like to provide a deeper dive in our financial performance for the quarter."",
  ""Revenues in Q3 totaled $6.7 million, down from $8.6 million in Q3 2023 and $16.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, as compared to $22.6 million for the same period last year."",
  ""As we've already stated in previous communications, this decline in revenue has been deliberate as we exited a single low-margin contract that was inherited as part of our last acquisition."",
  ""Gross margins have now reached 62% for the quarter and have averaged 60% year-to-date as compared to 32% and 28% in the respective periods last year."",
  ""Q3 EBITDA of $708,649 marked a significant increase from $33,408 in Q3 2023."",
  ""While year-to-date EBITDA of $120,866 reflects a major turnaround from a loss of $1.9 million during the prior year."",
  ""Our net income in Q3 amassed $295,580 as compared to a net loss of $184,885 in the comparative period."",
  ""However, year-to-date net loss remains at $1.4 million which includes $1.6 million in non-cash expenses."",
  ""As of September 30, 2024, our cash balance increased to $4.6 million from $2.9 million at the end of 2023."",
  ""And the company remains debt free."",
  ""We believe that the strategic investments made over the past two years in our people and our product suite, now firmly position the company for sustained profitable growth."",
  ""These results validate our strategic initiatives and highlight the underlying strength of our business model.""
]","[
  ""The first question from Yeah."",
  ""Next question comes from Yeah."",
  ""So, with Gambit, as everybody knows, we inherited one contract which caused our margin decline last year."",
  ""That contract came to a logical conclusion."",
  ""We did not renew on those terms."",
  ""We were unsuccessful in renegotiating that contract with better economic terms."",
  ""So, we made the smart decision of letting it go."",
  ""In the meantime, we have incorporated Gambit into our infrastructure."",
  ""And you will see in the coming quarter a relaunch of Gambit, more in line with the brand of Snipp and more integrated into our platform."",
  ""We essentially are a B2B2C company and incorporating Gambit into our loyalty platform was the core reason we bought the company and to allow for sports betting to be incentive in our portfolio."",
  ""Now that we have turned the corner with legacy clients that we inherited, necessary evil of any acquisition, we can move forward with – launching Gambit within the Snipp world as we had originally envisioned."",
  ""The next question, Margaret Barron from Canaccord."",
  ""What is the status of stock consolidation?"",
  ""Is that still on the table?"",
  ""Not only is stock consolidation on the table, but so is moving to the US exchanges if we think that makes sense for shareholder value."",
  ""We continue to evaluate all options that can enhance shareholder value."",
  ""A stock consolidation in itself, in my view, isn't of value without some underlying catalyst event."",
  ""Right now, the company is 100% focused on profitable growth."",
  ""We don't want to be in a situation where we consolidate the stock and the buying disappears and it just results in the stock falling."",
  ""So, we got to manage that risk when we do this."",
  ""But definitely on the table."",
  ""We got shareholder approval for it from our last – I think from last year's AGM."",
  ""The exchange might require us to get shareholder approval again, but we've made no decisions as to when to execute any kind of consolidation yet."",
  ""Can you speak – this is from Okay."",
  ""Good question, To give you some sense of a comparison, if you look at Ibotta which recently went public on the Nasdaq, they have over $1 billion of market cap."",
  ""I think they have about 30 million active users."",
  ""You can check that with the filings, please."",
  ""I might be wrong on that one, but it's in that range, $13 million to $15 million."",
  ""Having active users allows for companies that are building platforms and ecosystems and networks more than anything else, to be able to break the classic chicken and egg between advertisers who want to spend money to attract users and users who come to So, growing that active monthly user piece is a very, very critical part in order to break this chicken and egg and get brands to open their wallets and spend on the media that we've built."",
  ""And that's the value of active monthly users."",
  ""And it is the same kind of metric and the same kind of analysis an investor can do for any platform or network that has built an audience."",
  ""Next question is from So, our core business continues to grow as you guys can see."",
  ""It actually has not stopped growing, even if last year's results were kind of colored by the one contract that caused margin destruction as well as the revenue to go up very high last year in comparison to this year."",
  ""We have a set of really great customers who continue to give us repeat business."",
  ""I think 60% to 70% of our business comes from repeat customers."",
  ""But these customers are also very global in nature."",
  ""So, they have operations globally."",
  ""We do a lot of work with them."",
  ""80% of our revenue comes from the US market, but they have operations basically everywhere."",
  ""So, being able to land and expand with these same customers is a natural part."",
  ""Last year we invested in Europe."",
  ""We now have sales people in Germany."",
  ""We So, part of our growth is going to come from there."",
  ""It hasn't yet even kicked off in any form or fashion."",
  ""I think our European business was maybe I think 10% of our business last year, rest of the world was 20%, the US was 80%."",
  ""So, there's a huge amount of growth right there."",
  ""But then also the same customers that we have today in the US have other requirements."",
  ""Like I said in the past, we do 300 to 400 programs a year, we don't capture any of the media spend on those programs."",
  ""Clients, for every $50,000 they're spending with us, they're probably spending $500,000 on media."",
  ""So, if I could capture just a small percentage of that spend on the same program I'm implementing for them, you can see what the huge impact on our bottom line could be, right?"",
  ""The logic behind why we launched SnippMedia."",
  ""So, I think our core business continues to grow."",
  ""We are attracting also clients from non-traditional markets."",
  ""We've suddenly found ourselves working with lots of homebuilding companies as an example."",
  ""There's a whole market for tire companies."",
  ""There's a whole electronics industry, all areas we have not even tapped into yet."",
  ""And we are slowly, but surely progressing So, we feel pretty confident that from our existing clients, working with them in different markets, selling them new products, entering new markets, we've got a nice spot ahead of us on our core business to continue growing at a steady clip over the course of the next few years."",
  ""Next question comes from Okay."",
  ""So in terms of capitalized R&D, we don't capitalize a tremendous amount of the R&D that we put in."",
  ""It's really based on whatever the auditors will allow us to or make us capitalize."",
  ""So, I think it equates to about $200,000 a quarter, if I've got the numbers correct."",
  ""What we expect from that is really the continued enhancement of our platform, the launch of SnippMedia, all the work that we've done to integrate Gambit into our platform."",
  ""So, the revenue expected from the investment is really the core business revenues that you've seen today and the ability to monetize them more efficiently, right, which is what explains how our EBITDA can continue to grow and our margin can continue to grow."",
  "" Yeah, absolutely, which is why we bought them, right."",
  ""But monetization isn't necessarily the way you see Gambit when we bought them and ran it for the first couple of years."",
  ""Selling – expanding our rewards portfolio was the primary purpose of buying Gambit."",
  ""So to the extent that clients want to incorporate games of chance related to sports into their programs which they do, that's going to result in our being able to monetize that asset."",
  ""The original asset as it was, was an MVP product."",
  ""We have had discussions with different parties that have been interested in picking up that asset from us."",
  ""And if we thought a deal made sense to do, we do a deal on the original core assets."",
  ""But right now, there's nothing on the horizon which gives me confidence to tell the world that we're going to sell some of those core assets of Gambit."",
  ""We did buy them for own use."",
  ""But if there's a deal that we can do to carve out certain types of implementations, we absolutely would."",
  ""So as I was saying earlier on today, we've been landing and expanding with our clients not just in the US market, but in other markets."",
  ""So, there's been some expenditure there."",
  ""We've been building a brand new industry, disruptive product in SnippMedia, making sure we don't fall down with what we've done with Bank of America, for example, or AmpliFi or Triple is really, really important."",
  ""So, there has to be some incremental investment in that."",
  ""I can't go to Bank of America and just assume that you can service a client that big with that much of security requirement, et cetera, et cetera, without having an incremental expense."",
  ""So, some of our – investments in these areas are quite small in comparison to the opportunity in front of us."",
  ""And also, if you want to think of us as a startup doing just a financial media network, that's an industry first."",
  ""And going into Bank of America, if we had been VC funded, I mean So, you can look at some of these companies out there that are trying to build similar kind of networks with us."",
  ""They don't have half the coverage because they don't have a company like Bank of America behind them."",
  ""And you can see how much they have raised to the tune of $30 million, $40 million, actually, that we managed to accomplish on a very small budget of $1 million or less."",
  ""So, that's what explains the small increments in salary and wages."",
  ""So, It actually, it's a good question."",
  ""Actually I think our salary and wages will actually fall."",
  ""It's the end of the year."",
  ""We're pretty draconian about performance and making sure that we only keep people who perform at a certain level."",
  ""So, there'll be some amount of change that you all will see coming through, not only on the financials when it comes to salary and wages, but also in terms of announcements of certain personnel that have just graduated from Snipp."",
  ""I would, for the sake of your model, Okay."",
  ""So So, I think I would basically say on a steady state, we want to grow profitably and grow EBITDA as the quarters go by."",
  ""If you go back to 2022, you'll see we – I think we had around of like eight or nine quarters of EBITDA positive in steady state, right."",
  ""So, however, opportunities do come up for a business like ours, especially in an industry like ours, which is consolidating fast."",
  ""So, I can confidently tell you that on a steady state, yes, but I reserve the right to make decisions that actually enhance shareholder value for the long-term."",
  ""Look, we are $22 million company at the most right now."",
  ""I'm not that worried about EBITDA positive."",
  ""If I need to get to $150 million in valuation."",
  ""And so, I need our flexibility to run the business strategically versus on a quarter-to-quarter basis."",
  ""What plans do you have for cash reserve stock buybacks?"",
  ""At this stage, we don't have a formal plan on utilizing our cash reserves for stock buybacks."",
  ""I mean, even if we could, I think the exchange only allows us to spend about 5% of the capital, of the outstanding share capital on stock purchases."",
  ""It's not going to make that much of a difference."",
  ""That said, if there is a good enough reason to do so and a good catalyst event that will benefit from also doing a stock buyback as well as a rollback, we absolutely would."",
  ""Right now, our cash reserves are to build our business, grow our markets, grow our products, expand within our clients."",
  ""Who knows, even look out for an acquisition one makes sense to do."",
  ""That's something that can take us from being a $20 million company to a $50 million company."",
  ""I think that's the largest number of questions we will face in a conference call."",
  ""So, we welcome the discussion."",
  ""If you'll have questions, feel free to text me, call me."",
  ""Send us a message on our investor line."",
  ""Now that Richard's been on boarded, you get better answers, if not faster from him and me."",
  ""One thing I'd add to that, Atul, in addition to exiting any legacy business that was not attractive for Snipp Interactive at a consolidated basis."",
  ""We have also now eliminated any legacy costs and overhead associated with operating the Gambit platform as well."",
  ""And to add some color to those numbers, we speak a lot about the noise and impact of a single legacy contract on the consolidated business."",
  ""However, if you strip out that contract and look at nine months, year-to-date performance, 2024 versus 2023, revenues are actually for the core business have increased by 21%."",
  ""And so, as we end 2024 and are able to start delivering Q-on-Q comps that are more comparable or comparable because it will not be a legacy impact from a discontinued client relationship, those numbers will start to translate and that's what you're starting to see in our single quarters."",
  ""That's where you're seeing the margin expansion and where you're seeing inherently what is a sustained high-level top line growth."",
  ""Put a quantum on that."",
  ""In the history of the business, Snipp has invested roughly $40 million in developing its technology solutions, the overwhelming majority of which has been expensed as incurred."",
  ""However, that asset, that investment, is still the core technology base from which we develop and produce all of our revenue growth going forward."",
  ""So, the economic life in that investment is still long term, even if it's been fully expensed and does not appear on the balance sheet in a more traditional manner."",
  ""One comment I would add to that if I may, Atul."",
  ""When you look at the salaries and payroll compensation and overall head count, while it looks like there's a tremendous increase on a Q-on-Q or year-on-year basis, I think strategically you have to look at the company as a whole."",
  ""And while the company was in the midst of dealing with integration headwinds and moving forward with our strategy, we also had to make an investment in our people so that we can be in a strong position to capitalize on growth opportunities going forward."",
  ""And that's what we've done."",
  ""Now, I believe we have the proper human capital in our business to support continued growth of the business, and that investment certainly has an impact."",
  ""But as we move forward, we expect to see that, that line and that overall quantum of cost will stabilize.""

  "" for for taking the time to join and listen in to our interim results presentation."",
  ""I'm joined today by our CFO, Ash Mehta as well, and the two of us will walk you through the results and some of the business strategy and, hopefully, provide you with some content that sparks some questions."",
  ""So, please feel free to interact with the Q&A tab."",
  ""We've got that up here on the screen and we'll try to get through as many of the questions as we can here as we get to the end."",
  ""So, from an agenda perspective, we'll kind of follow the same plan."",
  ""For those of you that have attended in the past, it will look a lot like what we've done in the past, with a few small changes."",
  ""So, we'll walk through a little bit just a very quick reminder of sort of the Celebrus mission statement and values."",
  ""And the reason we're doing that is as we're building out the business and we continue to sort of communicate with investors, we communicate with clients and we set our various strategies across the business and business plans for each division, we really try to align on those values and try to bring that to life."",
  ""So, you'll start to see some of that coming through in all of the materials that we're putting out."",
  ""And so, we'll just do a quick refresher of that."",
  ""I'll also walk you through some of the operational highlights."",
  ""For those of you that had read the RNS from this morning would have picked up on several of those."",
  ""Ash will then walk through the financial highlights and sort of review the balance sheet and several of the common views that we walk through in these meetings."",
  ""And then, I'll wrap up with some – just a view into some elements of the business strategy and cover off on our competitors, cover off on some of the – how we sell and how we go to market, and provide some use cases as well and just give you a sense of what customer success has been doing globally with our customers in not only helping evolve how we grow those relationships but also in helping us sort of collect all the stories from the field and make that readily available to marketing, to sales, et cetera, as we try to evolve the business and move forward."",
  ""And so, from a mission perspective, everything that we do with the Celebrus platform and everything we do in terms of the services and the data and the technology that we provide to customers is geared around helping them just build better relationships with their consumers."",
  ""And, as many of you are most likely aware, we sort of have two 40,000-foot view use case segments, one on the marketing advertising side and one on the fraud Celebrus platform."",
  ""The data that we create, the digital identity solutions that we provide in that marketing world are geared towards learning more about you as a consumer and then ultimately helping you do something, buy more products, get you to the content that you're looking for, make the experiences that you're having on that website, on that mobile app, on that kiosk in an airport much more eventful, much more fruitful and much more streamlined."",
  ""On the fraud side, it's about protecting consumers, right?"",
  ""And it's more about taking what Celebrus knows about an individual on that particular brand, website or your banking app, et cetera, and making a very quick decision based on the evidence that Celebrus gathers as to whether or not it's actually you before that bank transfer, before that purchase or, say, if you've fallen victim to someone gaining access to your credentials, et cetera."",
  ""At the heart of everything that we do, it's about being focused on our customers, helping them build better relationships with their customers, and then ultimately making sure that we're innovating along the way and keeping things simple."",
  ""And I'm not going to read all of the mission and value statements here that we sort of hold true as a business."",
  ""But, ultimately, innovation and simplicity is what you're hopefully seeing."",
  ""For those of you that have been following the brand during the time that Ash and I have stepped in and built the management team that we have today, hopefully, this is what you're starting to see."",
  ""Particularly for investors, if you've been to the investor website today, as an example, you probably noticed some changes there as well as we continue to sort of roll in the investor content with the larger marketing site and make it easier for investors to be able to digest not only what we're bringing out in terms of RNS and interims like this but also making it easy for you to dig into some of the case studies, some of the marketing elements and some of the more sales-focused elements that we're bringing in through our blog posts, et cetera, as well so that you have much easier access to that as we've rolled it all together."",
  ""From an operational standpoint, the first thing that hopefully you noticed in the RNS is that – is the broad sort of set of wins that we've chosen to highlight from both during and after the period, including a large global airline, a UK energy company, which was a new sector for us and was the utilization of our Salesforce application and the integration that we've built with Salesforce through their marketing cloud and data cloud capabilities."",
  ""A financial institution in the US, who has been with us now for a year and has taken on multiple upgrades during that time, sort of validating the land and expand approach that we've been building upon as we've built out several skills across sales."",
  ""You might remember the last time that we chatted, we had vertically aligned our sales teams so that we had sales team members in sort of our core five, if you will: financial services, insurance, healthcare in the US, retail, and travel and hospitality."",
  ""Now, we obviously have a UK energy company."",
  ""We also have a telco customer."",
  ""So, there's some sort of burgeoning areas of interest, including the education sector, but those are largely the five."",
  ""We've brought on a fintech platform."",
  ""We expanded our relationship with an existing European retailer."",
  ""We added a bank in Poland."",
  ""That was our first time doing business in Poland, which was a fun process to go through, but one now that looks fruitful for us given some of the partnerships that we've built in that market and several new opportunities sort of building in that region for us in Europe."",
  ""And we also expanded one of our healthcare customers in the US."",
  ""That customer has been with us for a little over two years and has actually taken on I believe it's three upgrades over the course of that two-year period, again, showing the ability for us not only to sort of expand that sales capability, our ability to prospect and close business, but also for our customer success team to be able to work with those clients once they become part of the family and help them get more and more value from the Celebrus software platform."",
  ""From a marketing perspective, we've really focused on aligning with the sales hunting process and bringing – and I'll come on to this later on – but, really, just helping align sort of an account-based marketing strategy."",
  ""We've done a lot of fine-tuning and a lot of learning of what's working and what isn't, what's a target account and what isn't, and we've really brought the sales and marketing teams together through some recent summits that we've had to really align on that."",
  ""And we've also continued to innovate the platform."",
  ""For those of you that follow our story, you know that we do two releases a year."",
  ""We've extended some of our patents and capabilities significantly over the course of the past year, with a significant emphasis on our analytics capabilities."",
  ""I'm not just reporting on Celebrus Digital Analytics, which we talked about this time last year, but also now building out a self-service analytics application built around the Meta-based technology deployed within all of our Celebrus Cloud environments, which continues to be prominent in all of our deals."",
  ""In every new logo that we've done in the past two years, only one of them was not a Celebrus Cloud opportunity."",
  ""And as a reminder, Celebrus Cloud is something we started standing up a couple of years ago that we've put quite a bit of engineering and innovation behind, which is single tenant private cloud platform that we stand up largely with our partner, AWS, today around the globe."",
  ""And we also continue to optimize the business."",
  ""We've done a lot by way of new systems, new processes."",
  ""One of the areas, as a part of this cloud transformation, was that we took some of the data centers that were active on our side, and we've consolidated those down now to just a single – this single data center."",
  ""So, we continue to find ways to optimize the business, to optimize costs, and to make sure that we're able to free up that money to put towards the things that are more revenue-generating."",
  ""So, just a bit about the strategy, competitors and kind of our approach in the market."",
  ""Again, this slide has kind of become our intro slide these days for how we talk about the Celebrus platform, which is our predominant – what we offer in the market, what we're selling and what we're building our strategy around."",
  ""This is delivered through Celebrus Cloud predominantly, as we mentioned before, on a single tenant private cloud instance, and it's all part of sort of how we simplify the story around what Celebrus does."",
  ""And as a refresher for everyone, brands that are using Celebrus to improve those relationships with their consumers are deploying our technology on their websites, their mobile apps, their kiosks in an airport, their ATMs, et cetera, and they're using that to basically build a compliant profile about you."",
  ""That includes your journeys, your interactions, the things that you're typing, your common behaviors and interests, et cetera."",
  ""And on the marketing side, that then is used to build better experiences, as I mentioned before."",
  ""On the fraud side, it's used to confirm that it's you, to protect your money, your assets, your accounts, but it's also used to power a lot of partner integrations."",
  ""And we talked a little bit about this in the RNS and how we've continued to expand some of the integrations."",
  ""We've had longtime partners like Teradata and Pegasystems and others."",
  ""As recent as a couple of weeks ago, we announced a partnership with Optimizely, an A/B multivariate testing solution and decisioning platform."",
  ""We've done the same with Braze, with Salesforce, with Snowflake, with Databricks, and all of the new technology partners are generally driven by a client need."",
  ""And so, we're not building things and hoping that people will show up."",
  ""We're using what clients are asking."",
  ""So, for example, one of the financial new logos that I mentioned early on in the US uses Databricks as their data platform, their cloud-based environment."",
  ""And so, we had to build an integration with Databricks, and then that facilitates a great value discussion, a mutually beneficial discussion with someone like Databricks about how we might want to do that elsewhere and how we might want to bring that to market."",
  ""And so, we're building these integrations based on client need, and then we're aiming to have these partnerships and these integrations become fruitful in the coming years."",
  ""So, it's a way of us building more and more pipeline."",
  ""We also invested heavily in analytics over the last two years, and this is something that just made sense for us ."",
  ""We've had clients wanting to just build visualization and reporting on our data, and it's become quite cumbersome for them to have to do that in another system."",
  ""So, it's quite easy, and I say easy because we're blessed with an unbelievable engineering team."",
  ""But it was quite easy for us to stand this up based on the data model and all the structure and thought that has gone into the Celebrus platform and all the various patents that we've maintained for years now and how this platform operates to really bring that together."",
  ""And so, we've really started to round out the platform, and I know there's a couple of questions that I can already see popping in kind of around the acquisition targets, as we've talked a bit about our acquisition strategy."",
  ""As we think about the first acquisition that could come to pass and there's nothing imminent, but it is something that we've invested in and that we're exploring and evaluating companies."",
  ""It's really about rounding out this platform, making it more business-friendly, adding new features and functionality."",
  ""And so, that first acquisition is going to be focused on being a bolt-on capability that we can bring into the Celebrus platform and cross-sell to their customers, to our customers and continue to innovate in the market is sort of the thought process there."",
  ""And from a competitor standpoint, as we've rounded out the platform and continue to evolve, the competition does change and based on kind of four high level categories."",
  ""On the marketing side, the bread and butter that Celebrus goes back to 1999, right?"",
  ""My first interaction with it was 2003 when I was a consultant at the time in the US."",
  ""On the marketing side, the main competitors are Adobe and Tealium, for those of you that are familiar."",
  ""On the fraud side, the main competitors there are folks like BioCatch or BehavioSec or organizations like that."",
  ""A lot of them start with the letter B for whatever reason."",
  ""In the analytics world, it's things like Adobe Analytics, Google Analytics and a few others like an MParity or things like that."",
  ""And then, we broadly, we kind of have thrown into the CDP arena, I suppose, as well."",
  ""It's a common nomenclature but, in my opinion, it's become very confusing because everyone claims to be one, and the definition of a CDP is kind of – it's kind of expanded a bit and lost its way from pontificating for a moment."",
  ""But we do find ourselves against some of the technology in that – in there like a Segment or perhaps a Lytics or things like that."",
  ""And so, the competition does vary based on what we're selling, based on who we're selling to, and we have sort of different battle plans for how we approach that based upon that particular sales situation and based upon the existing marketing technology stack that a brand might have."",
  ""And we are very much on the front foot of of really trying to sell a story with two sides of the coin."",
  ""One is the value story of what Celebrus will bring to an organization, and I'll show you some examples of that shortly."",
  ""The other is cost savings."",
  ""Candidly, if we're talking to someone who's perhaps frustrated with their analytics platform, we're not talking about making that platform better."",
  ""We're talking about moving them to ours, and that's something that we've been very successful in doing over the last couple of years with several of our key clients."",
  ""From a market approach standpoint, again, those of you who have been following the journey and meeting with Ash and I, we've stood up a direct sales function that includes hunters, that includes farmers, that includes customer success."",
  ""We've stood up a marketing function that we continue to innovate around the globe."",
  ""We have our partner team and we've really evolved our partners in terms of not just technology partners but also consulting partners."",
  ""And the three of them sort of formulate our prospecting funnel, if you will."",
  ""So, when we're going out to the market, trying to find opportunities, trying to turn those opportunities into new customers, the sales team is obviously managing the lion's share of that, but marketing and partners are feeding it with the activities that they're doing as well."",
  ""As we land and expand those clients, then we have, in essence, three growth funnels to think about as a business."",
  ""You have our customer success team, who's focused around the globe on helping clients get enabled on the platform, making sure that we have happy customers, making sure that those customers understand the value that we can bring and the art of the possible, et cetera, et cetera, but we also have two other growth funnels."",
  ""One is professional services and managed services."",
  ""The teams that are on the ground, standing up the environment, working with clients to enable the use cases."",
  ""From a customer-first mentality standpoint, And then, finally, the marketing team."",
  ""We've started to spend a lot of thought and put a lot of strategy into how we better enable and continue communication with clients as well, sort of through things like an ongoing newsletter, enhancing the way that we support our customers, updating the portal, updating a lot of our web content, investing in some research around the use of AI and our technical brochures and how to guides to make it easier to digest for customers."",
  ""And so, there's a lot there, the growing use of YouTube as a channel for us to show videos and capabilities of Celebrus in a meaningful way."",
  ""And so, this is how we talk about the business, this is how we think about our field teams and how we think about not only entering the market and winning business, but then also retaining customers and growing them in their usage of the platform."",
  ""As we're doing that, we come across, basically when we're prospecting, three different types of personas that we've kind of simplified it down to."",
  ""And based on the persona, so that determines how we engage."",
  ""So, if we're at an event and we're sitting at a booth or maybe presenting on stage and talking to people afterwards, what we're trying to do in basically three to five questions max, think of it as you're in the elevator, you've got 30 seconds to catch someone's attention, is figure out where they're at on the journey, where that person is and where their organization is."",
  ""The key persona for us is someone who's very frustrated, been let down by other technology and is trying to do something that our platform can enable."",
  ""That's our Holy Grail, right?"",
  ""That's who we're searching for."",
  ""The second persona is a more open-minded person."",
  ""Maybe they know that there's a better way to do things, but they need to be educated or convinced."",
  ""And that – there is more of a sales and a marketing play, and we're going back to kind of the funnels of how we educate and how we really bring them on a journey to become part of the family here."",
  ""And then, the third persona is the see you next year folks."",
  ""It's a bit tongue in cheek, right, but they're the folks that think they've got it all figured out."",
  ""Maybe they haven't hit the level of maturity yet with their platforms to realize that there's gaps and problems, and that is purely a marketing play."",
  ""And we're just going to stay top of mind, reach out to them through our newsletters, email marketing, et cetera, and hope that they graduate to either persona one or persona two over time."",
  ""What we're selling has also kind of been simplified."",
  ""Again, if you think about the platform slide that I walked through before, we're really trying to sort of bucket the stories, and that really coincides well with how we've vertically aligned and specialized our sales teams so that we have use cases and stories for marketing, for fraud, for advertising, for data science, artificial intelligence."",
  ""You can't have a presentation without saying that word at least three times."",
  ""It's just a rule these days."",
  ""Around our digital identity verification, which plays in both marketing and fraud analytics, et cetera, this is what we're selling."",
  ""When you think of – when you're looking at the balance sheet, when you're looking at the revenue breakdown that Ash walked you through, the software revenues, they are made up of this: our services and our capabilities and our software and our IP."",
  ""And, ultimately, what we're finding to be the biggest source of business for us in terms of top of the funnel entry in our pipeline, so when we think of prospecting in the true sense of the word, if I'm going to have a conversation with a brand and I'm at an event or I'm out at a networking thing and I've got a few seconds to really capture someone's attention, it's going to be focused around one very simple theme, which is how well do you know your consumers when they're not logged in."",
  ""Generally speaking, that's why Salesforce reached out to us to build the app that we built."",
  ""That's the integration we have with Pega."",
  ""That's the integration we have with Optimizely."",
  ""You can go down the list."",
  ""Every time we're building an integration, it's because the profiles and the identity solution that we offer for how we build a profile about a consumer is quite powerful."",
  ""And when you marry that up with technology that needs that data, it generates some unbelievable results for customers."",
  ""It also helps that in the sort of cookie apocalypse or however you want to refer to it, there's so much clickbait out there around first party cookies, third party cookies."",
  ""The way that we've architected our platform as a single tenant private cloud platform combined with the intellectual property and IP that we've built around this, means that the way that we're interfacing with consumers, as you're browsing websites and apps, is the most compliant and the most respected version of a cookie and how we identify individuals."",
  ""And it does give us a leg up on the competition in terms of how we manage that across all the different verticals that we ultimately operate with it."",
  ""And, what that ultimately has done is it generates results, and this is – I'm such a fan of our Customer Success Division and our VP of Business Development that we brought in to help really guide how we engage with customers and how we build a robust value story for our customers."",
  ""But one of the added benefits outside of just upselling and the revenue and the ARR that comes with that is that we've been able to consolidate a bunch of stories, and these are stories around how clients are using our data to generate real results in the field, focused on improving those relationships with their consumers, and you can see things here like cart abandonment in the retail sector and being able to get people to come back and reengage and purchase those items."",
  ""Things like marketing attribution that if you do a cursory search for because of the deprecation of third party cookies has made it very difficult for marketers to understand where their dollars are going and how well it's working, and it then also makes it very difficult for them to understand their customer acquisition costs, which is something that's going to be scrutinized on every balance sheet for every marketing department in every vertical that we operate within."",
  ""And you'll see things like decisioning."",
  ""You really can't build a decisioning program using a system like Pega or a Salesforce or others or Optimizely without knowing who the customers are."",
  ""It's really easy when they're logged in."",
  ""But when you unlock that power and you bring something like Celebrus to the table and can now start to build profiles from the very first time someone loads a page or a screen on their mobile device, that can become quite powerful."",
  ""And to kind of bring that kind of further, we'll just drill into one of these examples."",
  ""But media and advertising has been an interesting exploration for us."",
  ""It's something that I always felt like Celebrus should play a much larger role in for many years and through partnerships like Merkle and others, we've really found ourselves in the forefront of helping guide brands on how to best spend their money and how to avoid wasting spend."",
  ""When I was at my previous employer and we did a lot of media auditing, we came across a common trend: marketing and advertising budgets, particularly media, was one of the largest line items on a balance sheet, larger than R&D in most organizations as well, which means even a 5% savings, when you're talking about the – that sort of magnitude of spend, can make a huge difference on the bottom line for an organization and free up funds to be able to put that elsewhere in improving their relationships with consumers."",
  ""And you'll see that here in this example where because of the data that we were providing and the digital identity solution we were compiling and the ability for them to build better models and make better decisions in their advertising, because they had data that was timely, accurate and complete, without any gaps, they saved 40% on their paid media spend in that first month and saw an increase in activity."",
  ""So, not only were they saving money, but where they were placing the ads was generating better results."",
  ""And that's the two sides of the coin I mentioned before: the value story of increasing the throughput or increasing the value of that particular campaign, but also saving money along the way."",
  ""And I don't think, in today's market, you can do one without the other."",
  ""You have to be able to show your ability to save the money and make the money at the same time."",
  ""Similarly, on the fraud side, a lot of what we're doing in fraud for customers and a lot of the cross-sell and up sell and even some of the new logos that we've brought in on the fraud side have been very focused on this specific use case."",
  ""You know, there's a lot of legislation in the UK around scams."",
  ""At the end of the day, you're – someone's either gaining access to your account, pretending to be you, or they're trying to guide you to doing something that you're not sure you should do or that you shouldn't do in the first place."",
  ""Either way, you're behaving differently and, ultimately, that's the common use case of what we're solving, and it's rooted in the same things that we do in marketing."",
  ""It's rooted in our ability to understand digital identity, and it's rooted in our ability to build a profile about you, as a consumer as you're interacting with your bank across your various devices, as an example."",
  ""But in this case, we're building that evidence profile, and that evidence profile is ultimately what the brands are using in real-time to stop the fraud before it happens or as marketing likes to say, outfox the fraudsters as they've started to use all of these animal images which, interestingly enough, as we practice what we preach, when we're spending on our advertising and we're advertising on LinkedIn and in Google and elsewhere and bringing the brand out there with our marketing, for whatever reason, these animals, in funny sunglasses and suits, et cetera, behave – get way better click-through rates and interactions than anything else that we're doing."",
  ""So, you're going to see a lot of these animals, probably in our annual report as well."",
  ""So just, I guess, consider that a warning."",
  ""And, finally, before we open it up to questions, from an outlook perspective, the pipeline continues to grow."",
  ""For us, we know exactly what we need to do as a business, we know how much more we have to sell, and we still have four months left in our year."",
  ""We had a strong first half, as Ash just walked you through, and it underpin – we are confident in our ability to achieve this year's results."",
  ""There were some slowdowns, and we mentioned that in the outlook statement in the RNS."",
  ""I'm sure some of you have questions on that."",
  ""It was related to two things."",
  ""We had a couple of clients in the UK that were sort of waiting to sign pending some of the budget decisions that were being made."",
  ""Those have come through since then and closed."",
  ""They were supposed to be first half deals, though."",
  ""And we had a couple in the US that were sort of waiting on the election cycle, as an example, which obviously still leaves a bit of uncertainty in the US."",
  ""But from our perspective, the pipeline continues to grow and we're seeing some fantastic efforts from the team in not only growing the top end of the funnel, the prospects, but also finding our way through that funnel and getting ink to paper and closing deals."",
  ""And so, we've got work, work ahead of us, as every business does at this time of year, but we're continuing to plug away at it and we're really happy with the growing pipeline, the visibility and the new wins that we've brought in, particularly post the period, as some of those ones that we're waiting on started to come through and the dominoes started to fall."",
  ""So, ultimately, that's brings us to the to the Q&A. I really appreciate everyone's time today and we'll jump over the questions."",
  ""If you do have questions, please submit them to the panel there, and we'll run through a few of these here and try to cover as many as we can."",
  ""Throughout this recorded presentation, listeners will be in listen-only mode."",
  ""Questions are encouraged and they can be submitted at any time using the Q&A tab situated on the right hand corner of your screen."",
  ""Simply type in your questions and press Send."",
  ""The company may not be in a position to answer every question it receives during the meeting itself."",
  ""However, the company can review all questions submitted today and publish responses, where it's appropriate to do so."",
  ""Before we begin, I would like to submit the following poll."",
  ""And I would now like to hand you over to CEO, Bill Bruno."",
  ""So, let me just run briefly through the financial highlights, but many of these points will come up in the subsequent slides, so I'll go in a bit more detail on those subsequent slides."",
  ""The key overall message from the financial highlights is that all of the key indicators are up compared to this period last year."",
  ""So, annual recurring revenue is up to $26.2 million."",
  ""Total revenues are up but, more importantly, underlying that, the software revenues are up."",
  ""And if you have been following us for the last couple of years, you'll know that, for us, software revenue is really a very key indicator."",
  ""And the gross profit margin is up and I'll talk through why that is."",
  ""And also, I'll talk through what is more important, which is the software revenue gross profit percentage, and that's also going up in line with the previous periods."",
  ""PBT, we focus on adjusted PBT, which is effectively a proxy for cash."",
  ""I think that's our highest H1 PBT we've ever reported."",
  ""And along with that, the EPS is up."",
  ""Our cash position is healthy."",
  ""We have no debt and we're paying an increased dividend for this first half as well."",
  ""So, let's go through the income statement."",
  ""As you know, we split out software revenues and the hardware revenues, and the reason for that is that the hardware revenues are generally low margin and they're also very intermittent."",
  ""So, we still have some legacy customers for whom we supply hardware as part of an overall installation package, but this isn't something we do any longer and, in fact, there's only a handful of customers for whom we do that."",
  ""So, we separate those out because the real value creator in the income statement is the software revenue line."",
  ""And what you see there, compared to this period last year, is that those software revenues are up 22.6% up to $11.2 million now."",
  ""And moving down the income statement, we see our gross profit percentage, which is also up."",
  ""So, let me just talk about some of the dynamics behind that."",
  ""So, our software GP percentage is up to 56.2%, and the reason for that is twofold."",
  ""So, as we scale up, as we keep growing our software revenue line, there are efficiencies and economies of scale that we benefit from."",
  ""On top of that, where we add on new customers, whether it's a new logo or whether it's an upsell, the large part of that contract value is license."",
  ""So, typically, around 80%, 85% of that contract value will be license and you'll know that from our various revenue streams, license revenue is the most high margin, typically around 85% to 90%."",
  ""So, again, as we grow the business, you ought to expect to see that gross profit percentage for software going up period on period."",
  ""There is a first half, second half element, so it's best to look at it on a full year basis."",
  ""So, whilst we're higher than this time last year, we anticipate that the full year gross profit percentage for software will also be higher for the full year as well."",
  ""So, it's about scale, but it's also about some of the work that we've done."",
  ""And so, as Bill was referring to on a previous slide, we've done a lot in terms of moving our infrastructure into the cloud, and that has helped by lowering costs."",
  ""But on top of that, as we add on more customers and almost all of our customers now are on Celebrus Cloud, we're able to extract a lot of efficiencies and automation from the Celebrus Cloud environment, and that also then contributes to our software gross profit percentage."",
  ""Moving down the income statement, our operating expenses are up quite significantly against this time last year, but that's really a carry-through from some of the increases we've made in Q3 and Q4 last year."",
  ""So, of course, as we're going through a year, we're not only looking at delivering the numbers for the year but also looking at what we need to do for the subsequent year."",
  ""And so, on the 1st of April of the next year, being able to deliver the numbers for that year and being ready to be able to do that."",
  ""So, we made a number of investments, principally in customer-facing roles around Q4 last year."",
  ""We saw the costs go up for the full year last year and we saw the carry-through of that into the first half of this year."",
  ""Head count currently is just over 160, but the head count we're adding are principally customer-facing."",
  ""So, we've talked previously about how we've built a direct sales team, we've built a customer success team, and how we've invested further into marketing."",
  ""So, these are the main contributors to the operating expense line growth."",
  ""Finance income net, we have healthy cash balances."",
  ""I'll talk about those on the next slide."",
  ""But not only do we have those, but we also manage them very well."",
  ""So, we have converted our cash balances from GBP into USD."",
  ""We did that in the early part of this financial year, and that's all part of the change to report in US dollars rather than GBP."",
  ""But we managed those well."",
  ""So, we managed them really looking at the interest increments between investing for it overnight or a week or two weeks or months."",
  ""And so, over the period, we've got $658,000 of interest income."",
  ""So, that brings us down to an adjusted PBT of just over $1 million, again, higher than last year and the highest we've ever reported for our first half."",
  ""Moving down, we've got amortization and share-based payments, and those are typically non-cash items, and that's why we focus on the adjusted PBT."",
  ""That's effectively a proxy for cash generation."",
  ""Below that, as I said, the amortization, non-cash, share-based payments on cash, and that brings us down to a profit before tax of $250,000."",
  ""No tax charge for the period."",
  ""You may remember, we had a high tax charge for the previous year, and I did talk, at that point, about our tax charge coming down, principally for the fact that we have some tax losses in the US, and those will be used up this time around."",
  ""And also, through our further investment into R&D, the utilization of the patent box regime on top of the R&D credits regime will bring our tax charge down quite significantly this year."",
  ""So, that $250,000 for the half year translates into an adjusted diluted earnings figure of $0.0255 per share."",
  ""So, all of these numbers are in US dollars and in cents, and that again compares favorably for this – compared to this time last year."",
  ""So, on the balance sheet, not a whole lot to say."",
  ""I mean, other than the fact that it's a very strong balance sheet."",
  ""We have a healthy cash balance."",
  ""We have no bank debt."",
  ""Of the movements that are up there, let's look at the property, plant and equipment."",
  ""It's moved compared to this time last year."",
  ""But you may remember from the final results, this was really as a result of entering into two new office leases."",
  ""And, of course, under IFRS 16, we have capitalized those and put those on the balance sheet."",
  ""So, that's what that $2 million is, and that will run off over the course of the leases."",
  ""We had some inventory at the full year end, and we have some of that still at the half year end."",
  ""And that will be or that has already moved off the balance sheet now."",
  ""We don't have a warehouse."",
  ""So, this is typically a goods in transit or a goods in advance of a particular customer sort of hardware deal."",
  ""Trade and other receivables have come down since the year end."",
  ""We continue to collect our cash very effectively."",
  ""Typical payment days by our customers are 45 to 60."",
  ""We have very little aging – aged debt and we have no bad debt, and we've not had any bad debt for some years now."",
  ""Moving on to the liabilities, trade and other payables, it's down from the full year end and, if you remember, we had inventory on the balance sheet."",
  ""That was for a particular customer contract And you'll note, within that also, the deferred income line of around $12 million."",
  ""So, we bill customers in advance of their sort of year of services and license."",
  ""And so, we collect the cash in advance, and that's what that figure there represents."",
  ""It's people who've paid us in advance of the recognition of the revenue."",
  ""So, that brings us down to $37 million of assets, of which $26 million roughly is cash."",
  ""Let me say one thing about the freehold property."",
  ""It was one of the questions already posed."",
  ""So in the assets held for sale line, you'll see there a figure of $4 million."",
  ""That is the property we have in West London."",
  ""We have had that on sale for some time now."",
  ""The buyer has put in planning permission, and we're waiting for that to complete before we then get into finalizing the legals."",
  ""We anticipate that happening, hopefully, in the next few months."",
  ""And, finally, on cash flow, the major point here is really the unwinding from the full year."",
  ""So, at the full year, we had a high level of inventory, we had a high level of cash, we had a high level of trade creditors, and those have now pretty much unwound."",
  ""And that's why you see that movement in working capital, which covers the inventory and the debtors' and creditors' outflow of just under $10 million."",
  ""We had a high tax charge last year, as I said, and so we paid that tax, and that's around $2 million."",
  ""And then, the other items of note here, probably the capitalization of development costs."",
  ""So, historically, we've had around Lower down, dividends paid, typically in a year we'll pay around sort of $1.8 million."",
  ""So, in the first half, we paid the final dividend, which was $1.1 million."",
  ""We did have a purchase of some shares."",
  ""So, you may remember, we had a share buyback scheme."",
  ""The purpose of that was really to negate the dilutive impact of our share options."",
  ""It's not for earnings enhancement and we don't anticipate doing a share buyback scheme in the near future."",
  ""We have enough shares in treasury, which will cover that dilution from options."",
  ""So, again, as you look at the figures and you look at the adjusted diluted earnings per share, you also need to bear in mind that, actually, that dilution won't happen at this point in time because we are fully covered for that dilution."",
  ""And, one final point, I said at the start but just to reemphasize in terms of what our key metrics are, ARR is a key metric, and that's a figure which went up in the period."",
  ""Software revenues is a key metric for us as well."",
  ""Adjusted PBT is a key metric but probably secondary to the others."",
  ""So, we have a profit target we aim to meet, but we remain flexible."",
  ""And if we did see opportunities to invest to accelerate organic growth, whether it was a particular vertical or a particular geography, that's something we would consider with some impact potentially on profit."",
  ""But right now, we're geared towards delivering that profit figure and, consequently, also paying a progressive dividend period to period.""

  ""The sale of the old premises."",
  ""You've mentioned exploring acquisition targets – that jumped on me."",
  ""Could you share more on the specific types of technologies?"",
  ""So, I talked a bit about the acquisition strategy and the bolt-on approach and kind of what we're looking for."",
  ""In terms of capabilities, it's more on the activation of data."",
  ""So, it would be in – personalization is a common term that I would throw out around that, marketing automation."",
  ""In the fraud world, it would be called intervention."",
  ""But it's really – if you think about our platform, we've rounded out the analytics and the reporting, the machine learning."",
  ""We've got the data collection and the digital identity capabilities."",
  ""So, we know who the consumers are, we know what they're doing and we know what they're interested in."",
  ""It's a structured dataset that can plug into any technology as we've proven through our various partnerships."",
  ""And it's really about finding some technology that we can plug into, but this time in a more formal acquisition-type relationship that brings value to our customers and gives us something else to sell in the market as well."",
  ""Anything you want to add on that, Ash?"",
  ""What gives you comfort in achieving the PBT FY 2025 forecast?"",
  ""Do you want to talk through maybe the second half weighting and kind of some of the margins that come in through that, Ash?"",
  ""What is the average deal cycle length and how has that been affected by recent market conditions?"",
  ""So, it's a good question."",
  ""I'll give you – I'll try to give you a succinct answer here because there's a lot of analysis that we do as we win or lose deals."",
  ""We do a bit of a deal review, which includes a bunch of metrics that we capture in Hubspot around how the deal flows, the timelines, how long they're in each stage."",
  ""So, we've got a five-stage pipeline and sort of the amount of activity that's happening with the client at each of those stages, which generally shows how good the engagement level is with those customers."",
  ""And you can start to see what's working and what isn't and start to see some patterns."",
  ""So, our VP of Global Sales has kind of revamped our sales process."",
  ""So, very early on in a deal now, we're getting quite a bit buttoned up in terms of commercials and the costs and kind of all of the basics of the thing that you – what you'd want before you start the legal process."",
  ""The legal process is the longest part."",
  ""Our average deal cycle, it kind of averages out around six months, but types of deals seem to have different timelines."",
  ""That factor into that average."",
  ""Holistically, it's about six months."",
  ""But if it's a partner-led deal, it's usually a little longer and that's because when we're selling direct, which the timeline is shorter, we do a lot of pre-qualifying that we're still trying to help educate partners on how to approach that."",
  ""So, when we're direct, it's shorter than a typical partner timeline."",
  ""We've initiated over the last year our Celebrus Alumni Program."",
  ""So, people that have used Celebrus that, perhaps, have gone on to other organizations, we've noticed that in those situations, it's a much shorter timeline to close those deals."",
  ""So, we don't really – it averages out about six months, but we're looking at it and I hope that gives you a little bit of insight."",
  ""We're looking at how that's impacted based on the lead source, the type of deal, the use case that we're selling, and now that we're frankly closing more business and generating more new logos, it's giving us a good amount of data to dig into and really use that to learn."",
  ""The cash balance over the next 12 months, how will we use that?"",
  ""Ash, you can speak to some of these things, I'll just kind of refer back to the comments I've made around acquisitions."",
  ""I'd also mention that we're not thinking about this as a one-off scenario."",
  ""This is something that we want to have as part of the strategy."",
  ""We think it's prudent to constantly be monitoring what's going on in the market and look for opportunities that might make sense to bolt on to the business."",
  ""So, while there's nothing imminent, it also isn't something that we're planning on doing acquisitions, celebrating that and then stopping that process."",
  ""That being said, we also – and Ash alluded to this, we're looking toward – looking at how we might invest in some of the things that we're seeing working as well, different marketing campaigns in different types of events."",
  ""PR has been a big driver of business for us, and we've made some new investments in that."",
  ""So, it's constantly a conversation at the board level."",
  ""Any decision that we make to invest will be based on strong analysis and data to support that."",
  ""But, ultimately though, those are some of the things that we're evaluating."",
  ""And, Ash, do you want to talk through maybe buybacks and kind of our general views there?"",
  ""How significant has the contribution of the Solution Integrator partner has been to your revenue growth?"",
  ""So, as I mentioned, the partner element and prospecting does play a key role in lead generation for the sales teams, and we've built some strong relationships with with solutions partners."",
  ""We've got – we've done some great business with Accenture in a few markets through Europe."",
  ""We've built the global partnership with Merkle and Dentsu."",
  ""We also have some smaller niche partners, like a DCS here in the UK or IQZ over in the US, a lot of three-letter words or three-letter company names."",
  ""But, ultimately, my background was in consulting."",
  ""I built a vendor-agnostic consulting firm that I eventually sold to a different UK business and, when done right, they become an extension of your sales team, they help you with scale because then they become part of your services arm, and they can start to deliver services for your business."",
  ""So, we've got a big vision for how those partners fit into the fold long-term, and it's all starting with how we enable them and train them, which is something that we're working on right now and launching an entirely new online sort of training platform, a very cost-effective approach so that it doesn't need to be instructor-led training, and so that we can certify partners based on the services that they want to deliver."",
  ""So, again, these are things we're making investments now."",
  ""We're building these relationships now."",
  ""We're actually engaging them with some of our existing customers to help us out as well."",
  ""So, it's a two-way street."",
  ""And they're bringing us into – to organizations."",
  ""And so, these are things we're doing now that we're building for future success."",
  ""That's the way the way that we look at those."",
  ""What are the forecasted increase in costs due to the recently announced UK budget?"",
  ""I think I'll – I thought about it, but I thought maybe I'd let you touch on that one, if you don't mind."",
  ""I think that that's exactly what I was going to say."",
  ""How many customers have you lost on renewal and, if any, why?"",
  ""So, for those of you that have gone through sort of the annual report, you'll know that we provide an ARR waterfall each – at the end of each year because it's a complete picture and it's much more helpful than a half year view."",
  ""And we always include sort of FX changes and losses there."",
  ""In this current period, the interims that we're here talking about, we didn't lose a single renewal."",
  ""And through the whole of this year, in terms of our current forecast, I believe we've now locked up every single renewal that that was in place for this year."",
  ""I don't believe we have any that are outstanding."",
  ""We did have a couple of losses last year."",
  ""Those were partner-led losses, where the partner lost the deal."",
  ""They lost the relationship at the client and, because they were the reseller, we now find ourselves in a position where we have to kind of renegotiate as a separate entity to try to win those customers back."",
  ""There's not anymore of those because we've now engaged."",
  ""There was just one market that was a little bit difficult and not as partner-friendly despite being led by a partner."",
  ""I'll protect the names and not – and spare the – spare that for – keep them out of this."",
  ""But, ultimately, we don't have any of those anymore, and our goal is to not lose another customer."",
  ""I know that that's overly optimistic."",
  ""You'd expect me to say that, but how we think about how we engage with customers, everything that we're doing to teach our team as part of the culture and that customer-first mentality is one of our core values, is to try to ensure that we don't and to make sure that we're doing everything we can to make clients successful and that the team is going above and beyond to do that."",
  ""At the end of the day, we're selling software."",
  ""We need to make sure that software is delivering value."",
  ""And so, the best way to avoid that happening and to avoid losing a renewal is to listen and engage with our customers and be willing to admit if we're doing something that incorrect."",
  ""We've started to adopt, I mentioned, deal reviews."",
  ""One of the other things that we're starting to adopt – it was actually quite a good idea that our new Chairman, Tom, kind of brought into the mix in some recent meetings, but it's around the concept of – it's a military framework, but it's kind of around how you come to the table to evaluate a project when it's complete."",
  ""One of the airlines that we work with, they call it an after action report."",
  ""But it's in how you sort of take a look at a project, look back and be – and look inward and say, what could we have done better before you critique the entire thing?"",
  ""And so, we're starting to put a lot of processes in place to really make sure that we're looking at things holistically and that we're being honest about what we're doing well, what we're not doing well and where we can improve, and the management team has really bought into that."",
  ""We've built a phenomenal management team."",
  ""Beneath that management team, we've got a line manager team that HR has done a great job in getting them trained and giving them the tools of the job to really carry forward these values throughout everything that we do."",
  ""And I know it may sound kind of touchy feely, but that that's really important."",
  ""The culture element and that way of thinking, that customer-first mentality is honestly how you avoid digging holes and instead you build mountains, right?"",
  ""And that's what we're trying to focus on as a business."",
  ""I think we've got time for one more question, just scrolling through here."",
  ""Let's go with this last one, I guess."",
  ""What do you see as your most significant risks in the short and medium-term?"",
  ""I have a couple of thoughts, but did you have anything you wanted I mean, I think, I'm not going to make this a political discussion but, I think, for me, as I'm thinking about the business, obviously there's a political climate in the US and a change there that is a – has a bit of uncertainty for how that will impact certain verticals, like healthcare."",
  ""So, for us, it's about how we diversify."",
  ""We've been undergoing a lot of discussions as a management team."",
  ""We're in the midst of our business planning for next year and the years out from there, and one of the things that I'm really working with and pushing the team to think about are things that we should be doing now because it's easier to do now than it will be when we're twice the size we are."",
  ""And so, kind of looking out to the horizon and thinking about when we're that big, what does – what would – what should we do now to avoid a risk or avoid something going wrong or making sure that we can scale appropriately, and let's put that in place now, right?"",
  ""An example of that, just to be tangible, is around how we've structured the Celebrus Cloud team."",
  ""We talk about Celebrus Cloud."",
  ""As you know, it's now second nature."",
  ""We say it every other word, but we just launched it two years ago."",
  ""It's a significant growth driver for us in terms of ARR."",
  ""It's part of every opportunity, except for one that we've closed in the last two years, and it's its own business unit."",
  ""Despite the fact that it's a smaller amount of revenue right now, it's going to be a significant amount of our ARR in the future."",
  ""And so, we've made some some adjustments, we've financed partnering with the cloud teams, we've put some structure around this business unit, we've put some ongoing analysis and controls around this business unit to just make sure that everything that we're doing, the decisions we're making now to optimize that are being done for the long-term."",
  ""So, for me, there's a lot of things that we can't control and there are things that we can control."",
  ""And, for the stuff that we can control, we're trying to think two or three steps ahead."",
  ""One of my executive coaches years ago used to say, play chess, not checkers."",
  ""And that's kind of the way I think about it when we're meeting as a management team and how we overcome that."",
  ""Ash, anything you want to add on that?"",
  ""Just a simple , like always."",
  "" for taking the time."",
  "" for those of you that have invested in the company,  for putting your faith and good money into trusting in our vision, and I hope everybody has a good rest of your day."",
  ""I think that's all good."",
  ""Well, the first thing to remember here is that when we sign a customer or when we renew a customer, it's typically for a three-year term or a non-cancellable deal."",
  ""And what that means is that when we go into a financial year, it's not as if we have to sell that amount of our revenue for that year because a lot of it was already in the backlog and we know how much is going to run off over the course of the year."",
  ""So, we monitor that on a month by month basis."",
  ""So, at the start of the year, it might be a certain amount."",
  ""Obviously, during the course of the year, we'll sell more upsells, get new logos and that sort of amount already kind of banked, if you like, for the year will increase."",
  ""And we'll know what renewals are coming up for the year and we'll put them into our POS as well."",
  ""Although they're not certain, but we have a high visibility if there are any customers who aren't going to renew."",
  ""And what that effectively leaves is a kind of a gap, if you like, and that's the gap we need to fill, which is through new sales and upsells, and that's the number we track month by month, well, week by week sometimes, in fact, to keep an eye on."",
  ""And the comfort in filling that is based around the fact that that's a number that goes down month by month and, on top of that, we see our pipeline and how that's grown, and Bill talked a little bit about the further investments we've made into marketing over the last sort of six months or so."",
  ""So, we keep a list of all of those deals that are coming up in the pipeline in those days, and that's effectively how we monitor it."",
  ""Now, historically, we have had an imbalance between the first half and the second half."",
  ""The reason for that is that, historically, we sold principally through partners who had a December year end."",
  ""And so, a lot of our renewals and anniversaries are in the second half."",
  ""So, if you were to split out our ARR of $25 million, $26 million in terms of does it come through renewal or anniversary in the first half or the second half, the bulk of it would be in the second half."",
  ""So, when we go into the second half and we've already reported the numbers we have reported and we look at what's still to do, a large part of that is already covered by the ARR for the second half and on top of other service contracts that we might have as well."",
  ""So, that's what gives us that level of comfort and the systems we've implemented over the last couple of years or so in terms of a much better CRM system, a much better finance system, those are sorts of tools that we're using in terms of monitoring this."",
  ""So, as I said earlier, we don't anticipate another share buyback program."",
  ""We don't see any value in it right now."",
  ""It was for mitigating the dilutive impact of share options."",
  ""And we will pay you the dividend, of course, in the second half and we don't have a lot of CapEx."",
  ""We did have some last year because of the office moves that we did but, typically, we don't have a huge amount of CapEx."",
  ""There's not a lot of cash outflow there either."",
  ""We do capitalize some R&D and that's required but, effectively, that's cash that would outflow anyway as part of our OpEx."",
  ""It's just a movement from OpEx into CapEx."",
  ""So, really, no significant outflows of cash other than, as Bill said, the investments into anything we might make for organic growth or potentially for an acquisition."",
  ""So, essentially, what this is and the main factor is the change in employer NI, which has gone up by 1.2% of your payroll costs, but it also applies then above the threshold, which used to be about $9,000 roughly and is now above $5,000."",
  ""So, there are two whammies, if you like, in terms of that cost increase."",
  ""We have around 70 employees in the UK, and they are typically on more than average salaries, the average UK salary."",
  ""And so, this does impact us."",
  ""The calculation we've done, as a result of those two factors, gives us an increase of somewhere around £0.6 million per annum."",
  ""I think we're almost out of time, but what I would say is if you've been following the story for the last few years, you'll know that our customer base used to be primarily banks and financial institutions."",
  ""So, the work we've done over the last three years in diversifying that out into five principal verticals, including healthcare and leisure and retail, provides us with some sort of mitigation of portfolio risk in the portfolio of customers that we've got in that."",
  ""If there were a banking downturn, we still have a substantial customer base in other sectors, and that's a really important thing."",
  ""And then, the other thing, just to echo what Bill said, is just the growing pains that companies go through."",
  ""So, Bill and I have been through that in other companies, and that's why we have invested so heavily in systems and people and culture, and those are the sorts of things and training and that's those sorts of things which will help manage some of those growth pains, which companies inevitably go through and we'll go through them."",
  ""We have some, but we manage them, but that's a real focus for us right now."",
  ""Bill, Ash,  for addressing all those questions for investors today."",
  ""And, of course, the company can review all questions submitted today and will publish those responses on the Investor Meet Company platform."",
  ""And, Bill, I was just going to ask you for some closing comments to wrap up the meeting."",
  ""Bill, Ash, , once again, for updating investors today."",
  ""Could I please ask investors not to close this session, as you will now be automatically redirected to provide your feedback in order that the board can better understand your views and expectations."",
  ""This will only take a few moments to complete and I'm sure will be greatly valued by the company.""

  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Congrats on the strong growth momentum of overseas business."",
  ""Could management share the main contributors driving the So, let me translate myself."",
  ""So,  management for taking my question and congrats on the good results."",
  ""My question is regarding the outlook for our cash cow business."",
  ""My question is about Tantan."",
  ""Just management mentioned in prepared remarks that there are various updates to our product offerings, but also highlight the impact is yet to be seen such as on the user retention side."",
  ""And also, we are seeing user scale and revenue remains soft."",
  ""My question is about which product ideas or solutions management gets more positive?"",
  ""How long does it take about upgrade and the timeline?"",
  ""And how should we think about our Tantan Q4 and 2025 outlook?"",
  "", management, for taking my question."",
  ""My question about shareholder returns."",
  ""Firstly, regarding dividends, the company has a track record of six consecutive years of special dividends."",
  ""So, what's our dividend plan for this year?"",
  ""Additionally, regarding share buybacks, the company has a buyback nearly $150 million year-to-date."",
  ""So, the current buyback program, which will expire in the middle of 2026, has less than $15 million quarter."",
  ""At the current pace of repurchase, we expect that this program will be exhausted by early 2025."",
  ""So, what's our plan for further share buybacks?"",
  ""The sequential growth of our overseas business in the first half of the year was slower than we had anticipated at the beginning of 2024, primarily due to the need to address many areas for improvement in local operations, which required more time than we thought."",
  ""Revenue growth accelerated in the third quarter,  to the optimization of cross-border personnel management."",
  ""As a result, the operational efficiency of the Soulchill team got significantly improved."",
  ""Our strategy of empowering local staff in product operations will help us better address the unique social preferences and needs of users from different cultural backgrounds."",
  ""By leveraging the strengths of our local team, we have been able to strengthen cooperation with the local supply side."",
  ""And with the rapid growth of our overseas business, our operational markets and regions are also becoming more diverse."",
  ""Therefore, we will continue to optimize cross border management, establish our offices in key markets, recruit more local talents, and drive continuous growth in revenue and profit through robust focus on localization."",
  ""So, in the third quarter, total revenue of the new apps reached a close to RMB 220 million, with Soulchill contributing 60% to 70%."",
  ""And Soulchill has now surpassed the revenue scale of Tantan, and its revenue in the third quarter was up more than 50% year-on-year."",
  ""And as we strengthen our localized operation capabilities, we expect Soulchill to continue to grow rapidly next year."",
  ""And meanwhile, we expect our other two Middle Eastern apps to enter into a period of rapid revenue growth and possibly breakeven next year."",
  ""The incremental revenue and profit generated by our overseas business partially offset the decline in revenue and profits from the Momo app."",
  ""We believe that compared with our domestic business, which faced many uncertainties such as macroeconomic and regulatory issues, the growth potential and trajectory of our overseas business are relatively clear."",
  ""This is particularly true in the social field where we have distinct product and operational advantages."",
  ""That's why we have prioritized the allocation of human and financial resources to the operation and expansion of our overseas business in recent years."",
  ""We believe that our overseas business will play an increasingly significant role in driving the group's revenue and profit in the future, which will be clearly reflected next year."",
  ""And as for the financial outlook, I will leave that to Cathy, please."",
  ""So, last year, we implemented operational adjustments to our livestreaming and audio and video-based VAS experiences, with a focus on reducing revenue-oriented competition events."",
  ""And although this impacted our financial performance, it has played a positive role in reducing revenue concentration and creating a more stable and healthier social ecosystem for our cash cow business."",
  ""So, we remain committed to this operational strategy in the fourth quarter and further deemphasizing high-revenue competition events."",
  ""For the livestreaming business, this means that the incremental revenue from the year-end competition event will be very limited compared to the previous years."",
  ""And in the audio- and video-based VAS experiences, we believe there is still room for further optimization of some agency-dominant use cases and gamify play."",
  ""So, we will continue to fine tune our operation in the fourth quarter."",
  ""And as Sic mentioned earlier, in order to offset the decline in revenue from competition events, we have increased the monetization of our mid- to long-tail paying users in livestreaming and value-added services experiences."",
  ""So, we rolled out more interactive features and contents suitable for this kind of cohort of users and increasing the penetration and paying ratio, while driving steady growth in organic revenue."",
  ""So, our primary operational focus in the current macro-economy and regulatory environment is to enhance our platform's ability to accommodate mid- to long-tail users and expand their revenue scale."",
  ""After about a year of adjustments, we are quite satisfied with the overall content and ecosystem of the Momo app."",
  ""I believe this has laid a solid foundation for us to maintain the productivity of the cash cow business next year."",
  ""As for the specific financial outlook, I will leave that to Cathy, please."",
  ""Okay, let me give you more details regarding your question."",
  ""For Tantan's goal is to continue to improve the So, in terms of product, some users feel the experience is unrealistic and chat interaction after matching is quite low and therefore, although users have a real strong demand for dating but Tantan cannot really meet the needs of many of our users."",
  ""And the second issue is insufficient branding and low organic traffic, which makes unit acquisition cost too high to form a positive business cycle to achieve profitable growth."",
  ""So, we believe that we must first improve the product experience to a reasonable level, and then, develop a new sustainable business model."",
  ""So, over the past two quarters and for the next quarter or two, we have focused and will continue to focus on addressing two user experience issues."",
  ""One is user's uncertainty about the authenticity of the match's identity, and the other is the lack of our response to chat post matching."",
  ""Our team encourage the users to enrich their profile information and guide them in choosing the proper style for their profile pictures."",
  ""And these efforts significantly increased the proportion of high-quality profiles on our platform and to effectively increase the overall real-person verification rate, we offered rewards such as extra swipes to users who completed the real-person verification process."",
  ""And previously, paying users had a clear advantage over non-paying users in terms of our product experience."",
  ""Moving forward, our goal is to give our verified users a distinct user experience advantage over those non-verified users, and to encourage more users to complete their verification process."",
  ""While we have made significant progress in terms of our user identity authenticity, we still need to do more to improve chat interaction rates in the long term."",
  ""Unfortunately, we feel that the current approach is on the right track."",
  ""We plan to have all testing underway by the end of the year and wrap up this round of upgrade in the first half of next year."",
  ""Since Tantan hasn't entered a positive business cycle yet, we expect the decline in users and revenue to continue for the next two quarters."",
  ""And to drive Tantan's recovery, here are some thoughts."",
  ""First, by improving Tantan's basic dating experience and especially our user identity authenticity, we expect the user base to gradually stabilize even without increasing marketing investment."",
  ""And secondly, after essential product adjustments are made, we will invest more in branding initiatives to drive organic traffic."",
  ""Third, we will continue to explore and develop innovative product features that improve user experience while identifying value-added products that increase our ARPU."",
  ""China's dating market is very large with significant unmet needs."",
  ""We will continue to explore this space to capture growth opportunities."",
  ""Regarding the bottom line, we will not pursue profits before Tantan enters a positive business cycle, but we will not let Tantan fall into continuous losses again."",
  ""As for detailed financials, I will leave that to Cathy."",
  ""In our Q4 guidance, we are assuming Soulchill to grow probably by 40-plus-percent year-over-year."",
  ""That would close out 2024 with a year-over-year growth rate of close to 50%."",
  ""As the app gets bigger, obviously, the growth rate could slow down a little bit."",
  ""However, our two other social entertainment apps in the Middle East, North Africa area have been ramping up rapidly recently."",
  ""We do expect these two apps to start bearing fruits and contributing to the bottom line in – contributing to both the top line and bottom line in a meaningful way in 2025."",
  ""With these three oversea apps, we believe oversea revenues will continue to grow pretty fast and, hopefully, could accelerate its growth rate in next year."",
  ""The other thing worth mentioning is that if you look at the way we manage our overseas business, we are not pursuing just top line growth at the expense of bottom line."",
  ""We always want what we call profitable growth."",
  ""That means, next year, as oversea apps continue to grow our top line, bottom line performance for these three apps are going to continue to improve as well."",
  ""Hopefully, that answers your question, and handing back to Ashley for next question."",
  ""Before I talk about 2025, perhaps, let me first quickly review the way we've been managing the – the way how we've been managing the productivity of the cash cow business throughout last year, and then, point towards the direction as we move toward next year."",
  ""The biggest theme of 2024 for the cash cow was to de-emphasize the promotion of VAS stimulating, agency-driven events in order to improve the healthiness of our ecosystem in view of the current macro environment, both from a regulatory and from an economic point of view."",
  ""As we took different steps to enable such operational changes, the revenue has been gradually coming down."",
  ""So, in order to maintain the productivity of the cash cow business, we have also been taking measures to control spending, control spending more tightly."",
  ""At the beginning of 2024, the original plan was to put all the adjustments into Q1 and make the revenue impact one-off."",
  ""However, as we move deeper into the year, it turned out that we did a pretty good job in cost control, and thus, over-delivered in terms of profit."",
  ""As a result, the team decided to take this opportunity to continue to put in additional adjustment measures to scale back on bonus-driven promotional events in the second half."",
  ""And in turn, we saw the top line of the cash cow business continuing to trend downward throughout 2025 from Q2 onwards."",
  ""With that in mind, looking out to 2025, well, first of all, I won't be able to talk about next year in very quantitative terms before we finalize the financial planning next year, early next year."",
  ""But as in previous years, there are several points to share to help you think about the performance of the cash cow, at least trend-wise, for the coming few quarters."",
  ""As Tang Yan – first of all, as Tang Yan said, after a year of pretty significant operational adjustments at the expense of top line, we feel – we now feel pretty good on the ecosystem front."",
  ""And therefore, currently, we do not see additional adjustments needed for next year."",
  ""If you think about what that translates into top line performance next year, how that translate into top line performance next year, Q1 Momo is – Q1 2025, Momo is still going to see seasonality, which would cost a sequential decline."",
  ""And then, Q2, there will be a seasonal bounce back."",
  ""Since we do not expect any deliberate operational efforts to demonetize next year, how significant the bounce back in Q2 2025 will really depend on macroeconomic factor that would play substantially into the consumer spending sentiment on our platform."",
  ""So, if you put all these analyses together, what we can come down to is that because the revenue has been trending downwards in the second half of 2024, next year, in terms of year-over-year comparison, it's quite likely that cash cow will continue to see revenue decline on a year-over-year basis."",
  ""In 2024, if you throw in the midpoint of our Q4 guidance, it looks like that the Momo segment, which by the way, included both the cash cow business and oversea apps, that whole Momo segment will likely still see a revenue decline in the low-teens kind of range that reflects both volunteer demonetization efforts and regulatory concerns and macro headwinds for 2025, because on the regulatory side, it seems that we are now in a pretty safe place."",
  ""And the oversea, as Tang Yan said a little bit earlier, the oversea growth will continue to push the top line up for Momo segment, assuming macro status quo continues, the Y-o-Y decrease should significantly narrow from what we saw in 2024."",
  ""But of course, assuming macro status quo is going to continue is kind of a big assumption, we'll see how things play out next year."",
  ""But of course, even assuming a substantial narrow down in Y-o-Y decrease ratio in absolute dollar amount, the cash cow may still face a pretty significant top line decrease in 2024."",
  ""So, we are going to have to see what we can do on cost control front to mitigate impact on bottom line."",
  ""On that specific point, I shall have more color to share as we finish our financial planning in the beginning of 2024 when we have our Q4  early next year."",
  ""So, that's basically the color that I can give on the productivity of the cash cow."",
  ""Now, back to Ashley for next question."",
  ""With regards to financial performance, the simple answer is that the top line is likely to continue to trend down sequentially due to two reasons."",
  ""The first one is, as Tang Yan mentioned now, Tantan has not reached a self-sustaining, positive business cycle yet."",
  ""User number is still trending down."",
  ""The reason second reason is that although there is still room to pull up the ARPU, the focus at this point is to get the dating experience right, and therefore, we do not want to put too much pressure on the team so they won't let monetization get in the way when consumer experience is the most crucial priority."",
  ""With regards to profits, this year, Tantan is on track to achieve, I think, RMB 50 million plus or minus, in terms of segment profits."",
  ""However, the bottom line has also been trending down slightly throughout the year due to the top line pressure."",
  ""So, before we reach, I would say, that before we reach the tipping point on top line performance, we do need to take some steps to cut down on the cost and expenses front, so that Tantan won't slide back to loss."",
  ""That's one of the key priorities for our financial planning for Tantan 2025."",
  ""And I think, on that, I'm going to have more details for you on our next  when we finish planning for 2025."",
  ""In the interest of time, let's take one last question before we call it a day."",
  ""As you correctly pointed out, during the past 12 months, we've bought back more than, I think, more than $150 million worth of Momo shares and paid around $100 million in cash dividends."",
  ""For me, I really look at both approaches, meaning cash dividend and buyback as ways to enhance shareholder value, but sometimes one works better than the other."",
  ""If you take our Q3 balance sheet number and do a quick math, we are – you would be looking at somewhere around $8.7 per share in net cash and that's a growing number as we continue to make profit."",
  ""And yet, our stock is, trading at, I believe, below $7 per share at this point."",
  ""I would say in view of such a significant undervaluation, we should give buyback bigger priority in comparison with cash dividends."",
  ""However, how much we could buyback is limited to a number of factors, the biggest of which is the liquidity out there in the market."",
  ""If you look at the past couple of quarters, our repurchase has been running at – from $30 million per quarter to around $60 million per quarter."",
  ""With the limited liquidity we have, it's hard to exceed that kind of run rate in terms of how much we buyback."",
  ""That means we – it's quite likely that we may continue to have excess cash on top of buyback."",
  ""If that continue to be the case, we will certainly continue to consider cash dividend as an additional way to return cash to the shareholders, so we can share our prosperity."",
  ""The other question you have is we'll be – we'll probably, at the current run rate, we'll probably use up the repurchase already authorized by the board of directors."",
  ""But I think we're not limited to that cap."",
  ""If the current program, is used up, well, I'm sure that the board of directors will continue make decisions that make sense in terms of enhancing the shareholder value."",
  ""So, that's what I can say at this point."",
  ""Maybe back to Ashley to conclude the call."",
  ""Well, , everyone, for participating in the call."",
  ""And I think that's going to be the end of it, and we will see you next year.""

  ""All figures exclude Altice Media and UltraEdge."",
  ""Total revenue declined by 4.7% year-over-year."",
  ""In the detail, Residential Service revenue declined by 1.6% year-over-year, mostly driven by negative volumes on mobile over the recent quarters."",
  ""Fixed service revenue grew by 2.5% year-over-year in the third quarter, driven by growing recurring ARPU revenue."",
  ""This core recurring ARPU revenue growth is a function of improved from book and back book pricing."",
  ""In terms of the fixed network, we continued to expand our addressable fiber footprint in France with more than 39 million fiber homes passed at the end of the third quarter, including only a small portion of homes with FTTB Technology."",
  ""The mobile service revenue year-over-year declined by 4.4%, driven by volume declines."",
  ""In terms of subscriber trends, for the first nine months of this year, almost half of the subscriber net losses were related to prepaid."",
  ""As noted last quarter, we continue to see competitive intensity within the mobile market, especially from digital and online offers at the low end of the market."",
  ""We adjusted some of our digital and online offers in order to remain competitive vis-a-vis the price points offered by our competitors."",
  ""In terms of our mobile network, we continue to expand our 5G coverage with more than 80% population coverage at the end of September 2024."",
  ""Business services revenue declined by 10.3% in the third quarter."",
  ""This decrease was mainly driven by concession revenues and more specifically by the reduction in the number of homes passed compared to last year as outlined in previous quarters."",
  ""In Q3 2024, 81,000 FTTH homes were built for XpFibre compared to 129,000 homes in Q3 2023."",
  ""Business services, excluding construction declined year-over-year also, notably due to lower B2B revenue."",
  ""Over the page on slide 4, you can see the summary financials for the third quarter."",
  ""As explained earlier financial for all period as shown on this slide exclude Altice Media and UltraEdge e. Total revenue declined by 4.7% year-over-year, and EBITDA declined by 9.9% year-over-year in the third quarter."",
  ""There were three main items to note explaining the EBITDA trend."",
  ""Firstly, the direct drive-through of the mobile retention revenue decline to EBITDA."",
  ""Secondly, the construction drag was a headwind on EBITDA."",
  ""As previously outlined, we are reaching the end of the construction activity for XpFibre."",
  ""Whilst this will remain a material drag until the end of 2024, the size of this year-over-year drag would mechanically decrease in 2025."",
  ""Thirdly, as explained in previous quarters, we are seeing an increase in FTTH lease costs."",
  ""Total CapEx was €490 million in third quarter."",
  ""And consequently, total operating free cash flow was €389 million."",
  ""And now, I will hand over to Gerrit Jan to take you through the rest of the presentation."",
  ""So moving onto slide number 5 where we show you the free cash flow waterfall for the third quarter, interest cost amounted to €318 million."",
  ""And for the full year of 2024, we expect annual interest cost of approximately €1.5 billion."",
  ""Cash taxes amounted to €21 million in the third quarter, whilst change in working capital and other was a €37 million inflow."",
  "" Turning to page number 6."",
  ""Here we show you the SFR capital structure and debt maturity profile."",
  ""On November 15, 2024, SFR closed the sale of its 49% stake in La Poste Telecom to Bouygues Telecom."",
  ""And the cash position and therefore net debt and liquidity are shown pro forma for the net proceeds associated with this transaction."",
  ""Pro forma net debt amounted to €23.7 billion at the end of the third quarter, with a blended weighted average life of 3.4 years and a blended weighted average cost of debt of 5.9%."",
  ""Pro forma net leverage was 6.8 times net debt to EBITDA on an LTM basis and 6.7 times on an L2QA basis at the end of the third quarter."",
  ""SFR had €1.4 billion of liquidity, which includes around €300 million of undrawn revolver."",
  ""Finally, as you may have already seen in the recent cleansing statement, Altice France expects for full year of 2024 an EBITDA of approximately €3.35 billion and CapEx of approximately €2 billion."",
  ""These figures are pro forma for the disposals of Media and UltraEdge, and they are also pro forma for the sale of the La Poste Telecom, i.e., removing the profits made on the wholesale contracts from January 1, 2024 onwards."",
  ""Given the amount of inbound inquiries and in the interest of providing consistent messaging to its various stakeholders, the company will communicate any information, updates or new information when appropriate or as required in broadly disseminated releases."",

  ""While there is much more work to do, our improving results increase our conviction that we are on the right path as we position Petco to win."",
  ""Throughout the quarter, I spent significant amount of time meeting with teammates across the organization in working alongside our associates and our pet care centers, to visiting our distribution centers, to hosting small group listening sessions at our support centers."",
  ""I've witnessed firsthand the passion our people have for pets and the dedication they bring to serving our customers."",
  ""Importantly, it's exciting to see the entire organization rally behind our plans to drive operational and financial performance improvement."",
  ""On our call, I outlined our commitment to resetting the trajectory of our business on the last call."",
  ""Today, I will share specific areas of opportunities, discuss developing plans to drive improvement and holding ourselves accountable, while we're on the path to returning to long-term, sustainable, profitable growth."",
  ""Our initiatives are currently focused on three critical areas: merchandising, servicing our customers, and driving efficiency across our business."",
  ""Allow me to provide you with an update on each, including specific examples."",
  ""First, improving merchandise remains the greatest near-term opportunity for us to strengthen profitability."",
  ""I'd like to take this moment to thank our merchandising team, along with our merchant vendor partners, for their collaboration and support as we take the necessary steps to make Petco a better retailer, employer and partner."",
  ""We're optimizing our assortment to be aligned more closely with customer demand and make it easier for them to shop with us."",
  ""In support of this, we completed a detailed review of our assortment across both consumables and supplies, and have identified several opportunities to enhance our offering."",
  ""Key focus areas for us include creating more space on shelves for faster-turning SKUs, as well as reducing SKUs in certain categories to simplify the customers' decision-making process."",
  ""In addition, I have met one-on-one with several of our vendors in order to directly learn how we can improve our relationships."",
  ""As consumers continue to be judicious in their spend, we have to meet them where and when they want with the value they're looking for."",
  ""We've implemented new processes to deliver timely product resets that allow us to offer more exciting products."",
  ""We're also sharpening our approach to pricing to remain competitive in the market and drive financial outcomes for Petco."",
  ""To date, we put in place stronger pricing guardrails, implemented more robust reviews of our pricing gaps, and established processes for promo assessments."",
  ""An example of our merchandising work in action is the recent launch of our Welcome to the Family program, given the importance of first-time pet ownership."",
  ""We designed this program in partnership with our key vendors, as well as our expert vet, training and grooming teams, to provide dog and cat parents with guidance, resources and savings on new pet essentials and services."",
  ""Second, to win in today's retail environment, we must improve the way we service our customers across our pet care centers, online and in our services platforms."",
  ""For my time spent working in our pet care centers, I observed several opportunities to drive greater consistency across the entire footprint, which will generate savings that can be reinvested into the customer experience and strengthen profitability."",
  ""Let me share several examples of where we are making meaningful improvements to better serve our customers."",
  ""We've set new standards for our labor model to staff our stores and in a way that allows our partners to spend more time with the customers and less time on tasks in the back of the store."",
  ""This extends to store leadership, where we're reducing tasking, administrative responsibilities and overall complexity for our general managers, bringing them up to spend more time leading their teams and driving store productivity."",
  ""Additionally, leveraging automation to standardize the online order fulfillment process in our pet care centers is one area, in particular, I see significant potential."",
  ""Finally, in services, our bed offering remains a key growth driver and differentiator for Petco."",
  ""Services revenue was up 9%, with strength across both hospitals and Vetco mobile clinics."",
  ""As our hospital fleet continues to mature, our services team is focused on accelerating utilization to support structural margin improvement of our vet hospitals and ensure we can meet the growing demand for our customers in a timely manner."",
  ""And we're leveraging our vet customer data to better understand their purchasing patterns, inform how we engage with them, and ultimately drive greater wallet share."",
  ""These initiatives are having a direct impact on our top and bottom line, as we're creating more selling opportunities for partners, while simultaneously driving greater efficiencies."",
  ""Turning to our third commitment, driving greater efficiencies across the business to bend the cost curve."",
  ""Within merchandising, we're taking action to improve our commercial execution."",
  ""In Q3, we completed key vendor negotiations, and we're pleased with the outcome as we continue to strengthen our vendor relationships and differentiated merchandising offering."",
  ""In our supply chain, we're renegotiating multi-year contracts with our shipping partners, reducing split shipments, and driving incremental improvements in distribution center labor to reduce cost per shipment and improve speed of shipping."",
  ""In vet, we're closely measuring performance at the individual hospital level, providing us greater visibility into the needs of each hospital and the staffing required to maximize efficiency and productivity."",
  ""We believe there is significant opportunity to improve the profitability of the existing fleet by ensuring hospitals remain staffed and are supported through marketing and merchandising efforts."",
  ""And we're taking action to professionalize our procurement team."",
  ""As a start, the requested contract negotiations and conducted RFPs across a broad selection of medium to large-scale indirect procurement partners."",
  ""We're pleased with the engagement and the outcomes we're seeing so far."",
  ""Overall, our cost initiatives are well underway and tracking against our prior expectations."",
  ""Importantly, these aren't just one time savings."",
  ""These initiatives are designed to fundamentally change the way we think and work to consistently identify areas of opportunity to unlock long-term value."",
  ""This redefinition of retail fundamentals is expected to have an enduring impact on our people and culture, leading to greater accountability and transparency."",
  ""Further ensure our success around our three initiatives of merchandising, servicing our customers and driving efficiency, we've added two key executives."",
  ""Leadership is critical to shaping the direction of the business, and I'm pleased with our recent hiring of two new leaders that will help us realize our full potential."",
  ""We named Joe Venezia, Chief Revenue Officer, a newly created role in charge of developing the integrated strategies for improving the customer experience and driving revenue across the organization."",
  ""Joe oversee these critical areas that contribute to Petco's growth, including the pet care centers, services, real estate and customer success capabilities."",
  ""Dan Calista also has joined us as our Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer."",
  ""In this role, Dan will be responsible for building the internal capabilities we need to get our fundamentals right, maintaining accountability through our ongoing transformation and positioning ourselves for growth."",
  ""These hires underscore our top priority for improving profitability through structural cost-out while positioning Petco for growth."",
  ""It's still early days, but our actions are beginning to take hold."",
  ""And we're setting ourselves up to play offense as we build momentum into fiscal 2025."",
  ""Before I close, let me leave you with this."",
  ""Having been in the role for over 100 days, I can say with conviction and certainty that I'm more excited today than I have ever been on our potential here at Petco."",
  ""The time I spent working alongside our associates showed me how their knowledge, expertise, and simply raw passion for improving the lives of pets and their parents is unlike anything else in the industry."",
  ""This enthusiasm that sets us apart makes me confident in our trajectory."",
  ""With that, over to Brian to provide more details on our financial performance and guidance."",
  ""In addition to the , there is a presentation available to download on our website at ir.petco.com summarizing our results."",
  ""On the call with me today are Joel Anderson, Petco's Chief Executive Officer; and Brian LaRose, Petco's Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Before they begin, I'd like to remind everyone that on this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from such statements."",
  ""These risks and uncertainties include those set out in our earnings materials and SEC filings."",
  ""In addition, on today's call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures."",
  ""Reconciliations of these measures can be found in our , presentation and SEC filings."",
  ""And finally, during the Q&A portion of today's call, we ask that you please keep to one question and one follow-up."",
  ""With that, let me turn it over to Joel."",
  ""First, I want to extend my  to our Petco partners for their continued dedication to delivering for our customers."",
  ""Our third quarter performance demonstrates improved operational and financial execution, enabling us to deliver results ahead of our expectations."",
  ""For the quarter, net revenue was $1.51 billion, up 1% year-over-year, with comparable sales up 2% year-over-year."",
  ""Breaking this down by category, consumables grew 3%."",
  ""Supplies and companion animal remained soft, at down 3%, but improved roughly 200 basis points sequentially on a percentage basis."",
  ""Services and other, which is comprised of services, wholesale and recently disposed non-core businesses, delivered 5% growth."",
  ""Services specifically were up 9%, driven by ongoing strength in our vet hospitals, mobile clinics and grooming."",
  ""Moving down the P&L, gross profit was $576 million, up 5% from prior year."",
  ""Gross margin for the quarter was 38.1%, up nearly 130 basis points from prior year, driven by progress on product cost management and improvements in services gross margin."",
  ""SG&A was $572 million, increasing 2% year-over-year."",
  ""As a percentage of sales, SG&A rate was 37.8%, up nearly 40 basis points, driven primarily by our planned step-up in store labor, in line with our expectations and reflecting our commitment to improving the in-store customer experience."",
  ""We expect these increased SG&A costs to continue into the fourth quarter."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA was $81.2 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin rate of 5.4%, up almost 60 basis points year-over-year."",
  ""All in, adjusted EPS was negative $0.02 compared to negative $0.05 per share in the prior year."",
  ""Turning to the balance sheet, merchandise inventories were $690 million at the end of the third quarter, as we effectively controlled our inventory, which, along with in-stock rates, are in excellent shape."",
  ""Liquidity remains strong at $644 million, inclusive of $117 million in cash and cash equivalents and $528 million of availability on our revolving credit facility."",
  ""CapEx was down $31 million year-over-year for the quarter; year-to-date, down approximately $85 million year-over-year in line with our guidance to reduce CapEx in 2024."",
  ""Free cash flow was negative $10 million, a meaningful improvement year-over-year, supported by lower inventory levels achieved as part of our ongoing approach through disciplined inventory management."",
  ""And we remain firmly on track to deliver positive free cash flow for fiscal 2024."",
  ""Before moving on to guidance, let me address the recent announcement of potential tariffs on goods imported from China, Mexico and Canada."",
  ""We have a few immaterial vendors where we source directly from Mexico and Canada, which we do not expect to impact us negatively."",
  ""Regarding China, relative to broader retail, we have a lower level of exposure to imported products, and we believe the proposals, as currently outlined, would not be meaningful to our overall business."",
  ""Specific to Petco Mexico, we do not source or import any products from them."",
  ""Rather, they source their products primarily from the US with select products exported directly to them from Asia or sourced directly from suppliers based in Mexico."",
  ""Petco Mexico remains the clear market leader in pet specialty in Mexico and an important strategic partner for us, continuing to drive long-term profitable growth."",
  ""I'll now turn to outlook."",
  ""As a reminder, Petco's fiscal 2023 fourth quarter and full year included an additional week."",
  ""For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue of approximately $1.55 billion; adjusted EBITDA between $90 million to $95 million, which is inclusive of a minimum of $10 million in third-party consulting fees associated with our transformation effort; and adjusted EPS between zero and $0.02."",
  ""Additionally, for the full year, we expect net interest expense of approximately $140 million, inclusive of the estimated impacts of our hedges against the forward rate curve, 273 million weighted average fully diluted shares and $130 million of capital expenditures."",
  ""Stepping back, we're encouraged by the structural improvement we're seeing throughout the business."",
  ""The meaningful changes we've made in the first nine months of the year sets us up for a solid finish to 2024 as we build momentum heading into 2025."",
  ""And with that, we'll be happy to take your questions.""
]","[
  ""I guess the first question, you've made a lot of progress on the cost side."",
  ""What would be a target same-store sales figure where you can start levering off this newer cost base?"",
  ""It's good to ask on supplies and companion animals and the more discretionary segments."",
  ""So still negative, but the underlying trend is improving there."",
  ""Wondering if you can elaborate on that, if that's just the – all sub-segments generally just doing better or if there's any insight to glean from specific sub-segments."",
  ""And maybe just as a follow-up, one of your competitors has been talking for a few quarters now on adoption trending in the right direction."",
  ""Curious if that aligns with what you guys are seeing in the market."",
  ""I know the data for adoptions is pretty spotty."",
  ""And if not, has it stabilized?"",
  ""What are you looking for to maybe get ahead of an inflection there?"",
  ""This is Matt McCartney on for Seth Basham."",
  ""I'm just wondering if you could talk about the pricing impact in the quarter, whether it was positive or negative, and how we should think about pricing going forward as you tweak your product mix."",
  ""I'm just wondering if you could talk about the services margin and what drove the improvement there this quarter."",
  "" so much for taking my question."",
  ""So Joel, it seems like your initial priority is to come in, cut some costs, focus on retail fundamentals."",
  ""So, A, how much of a opportunity for savings is there?"",
  ""If you could size that, that would be great."",
  ""And B, how much of that are you going to have to reinvest in the business to drive sustainable same-store sales growth, because as we know, this is a very competitive market with some reinvigorated players who are all looking to address the addressable market here."",
  ""This is Ariana on for Steve."",
  "" for taking our question."",
  ""My first question is, how has the business trended thus far in 4Q?"",
  ""And are there any call-outs for your holiday assortments relative to the implied 4Q outlook for – to revenue growth?"",
  ""And then my follow-up is, how do you think about the ability to regain market share in 2025 and in the medium term?"",
  ""Like is that from better growth in the category or do you see as the specific drivers to have customers reengage with Petco?"",
  ""This is Julio Marquez on for Steve Forbes."",
  ""I wanted to touch on the vet hospitals and the opportunity for efficiency enhancements."",
  ""I think you mentioned a need for full-time staffing, maybe some improvement on the merchandising side."",
  ""So, any color you can provide there on staffing and merchandising and maybe the anticipated lift."",
  ""And then, finally, any way to contextualize maybe the end state margin for the vet clinics and I guess maybe the scaling to get there?"",
  ""Maybe on the merchandising opportunities there and just – how you guys are thinking about like the end state margin for the vet hospital business and maybe the scaling to get there."",
  ""Is it more like an intermediate kind of thing, longer term kind of thing?"",
  ""This is David Lantz on for Zach."",
  "" for taking our questions."",
  ""So, I guess how should we think about the potential glide path of gross margin improvement from here?"",
  ""And is there any color you can provide around Q4 outside of lapping the 130 basis point inventory write-down?"",
  ""And then – oh, sorry, go ahead."",
  ""Can you talk about the 3% decline in services and companion animal in the context of the broader market?"",
  ""Hi, this is Lauren Ng on for Simeon Gutman."",
  ""We wanted to ask about the consumables improvement in Q3."",
  ""Just curious to know if this was ticket-driven."",
  ""Are you seeing new pet owners or customers coming to Petco?"",
  ""Just any color on the improvement there."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""So, I just wanted to go back to you talked before about opportunities in merchandising and negotiating better terms from your suppliers."",
  ""And it may still be early, but just curious if there's any update on what the response has been from vendors and how receptive they've been to your efforts there."",
  "" for the help there."",
  ""Another question I had was just on, and another one that may still be early to ask, but curious if there's any update on the vet hospitals."",
  ""And when you're thinking about potentially returning to rolling those out, since you kind of paused it for this year in the foreseeable future, curious on the timeline of that."",
  ""I'll give you some of my thoughts and, Brian, if you want to add anything."",
  ""Look, I think our focus right now is, as you said even in your question, is about taking cost out of our base permanently."",
  ""It's a structural change that we want embedded in our DNA to drive accountability and transparency."",
  ""But as it relates to longer term and the question you're asking, I think that's something that we should leave for March as we think about the longer term."",
  ""A lot's going to change."",
  ""Obviously, the number's much lower right now because we're so focused on the structural elements of costs that we think are permanent and not one-time."",
  ""Look, I think you're asking about discretionary."",
  ""I think it's more important if you think about Petco in the broader business, which, as I look at it, is really two-pronged."",
  ""We have a huge consumables business, and that's really all about being in stock and that's where a large focus of ours has been."",
  ""We just implemented a new inventory management system."",
  ""And then, as it relates to discretionary, you're right, we've seen a 200 basis point sequential improvement."",
  ""But discretionary is really all about innovation, newness, being trend right and really driving impulse buying."",
  ""We'll continue to get better at that, but we're really focused on both sides of the business and getting them right."",
  ""Look, I think everybody is looking at it a little bit differently."",
  ""The market is rather flat, is what we're seeing."",
  ""But as it relates to Petco in the short term, and by that, I mean, throughout 2025, we're really in a self-help situation and that we don't have to rely on the market getting better in order for our business to get better."",
  ""And so, look, if the market improves like you're talking about, that's just icing on the cake and makes us even stronger."",
  ""We're really focused on what's in in our control, and we don't need the industry success to drive near-term operational and profit improvement."",
  ""The market grows upside, as I said."",
  "", Michael, and good to hear your voice."",
  ""Look, I think at the phase we're at right now, Michael, none of what we're taking out at this point in time is stuff that we see we need to reinvest."",
  ""We think we still have significant more cost-out opportunities."",
  ""And as we get down to that second wave of stuff, certainly, that's when we'll start to look at things to reinvest, like more marketing to drive top line growth."",
  ""But at this point in time, our real focus right now is about taking costs out of the business."",
  ""It's not just one time in nature that has to be reinvested in the business, but it's a permanent cost-out, and that's kind of how we're thinking about it, Michael."",
  ""Look, I'm not going to get into kind of inter-quarter trends and stuff."",
  ""I mean, that's clearly reflected in our guide."",
  ""We're pleased with the start of the quarter."",
  ""And you can see by the guide the sequential improvement from Q3 is a nice improvement."",
  ""And so, that's kind of where we're tracking for now."",
  ""And I think we've got momentum going into the back half of the quarter here."",
  ""Well, look, hopefully, what you took away from my remarks is that I'm more bullish than ever on my decision to join Petco."",
  ""The passion I saw from our associates, the way everybody here has just embraced us in turning this business around and getting back to retail disciplines certainly then sets us up for growth in 2025 and beyond."",
  ""And as far as specific numbers and everything, we'll outlay that for you as we get into March and next year."",
  ""But hopefully, you sensed in my tone in my prepared remarks how excited I am and the progress we've made in a extremely short period of time."",
  ""If I heard you right, your question was about the hospitals."",
  ""Look, we've made a lot of progress this year."",
  ""Stephen, who joined us earlier this year and leads our hospital operations team, has just done a great job of delivering better profitability, helping us invest better in terms of staffing, utilization rates, et cetera, et cetera."",
  ""So, the progress we're making there is fantastic."",
  ""And it's certainly resulted in sales continuing to grow."",
  ""I mean, our hospitals in Vetco were up 17% this last quarter, and really pleased with the progress we're making with hospitals and vets overall."",
  ""Was there a second part to that question?"",
  ""Look, I think on the merchandising piece, it's us getting better at Rx."",
  ""It's us getting better at connecting our vets back into the stores, into grooming, into recommendations there, our product."",
  ""That's something we're just still on our infancy on and we can get to better."",
  ""As far as the ultimate goal on margins, there's just still so much improvement there that we're nowhere close to the peak there of what the ultimate margin is."",
  ""Our hospitals are rather still in their infancy and will continue to improve as our utilization rates go up."",
  ""Look, consumables was something I talked about a couple questions ago and that that business is all about being in stock."",
  ""And I think it's a combination of our new inventory management system that's now fully in place in Q3."",
  ""It's about the teams getting better at flowing inventory, better shelf utilization, and then just being priced competitively."",
  ""So, all those actions we're taking are starting to show up in better sales, and that's what you saw start to happen in Q3."",
  "" for the question, Kendall."",
  ""Look, I actually think I commented it on specifically in my prepared remarks."",
  ""The discussions with our vendors have been really well received."",
  ""I personally have met with some of our merch vendor partners myself."",
  ""And the key to all that is transparency and openness and talking to them about what they need as much as what we need."",
  ""We've had just really successful discussions there as we build our joint business plans for 2025."",
  ""And I'm really pleased with the progress our merchant teams have done."",
  ""The vet hospitals are a key growth driver for us, and they're also a key differentiator for us as all our vet hospitals are Petco-owned."",
  ""As far as what the specific growth for next year will be, we'll lay that out for you in detail as we get into March, but we do expect that to continue to be a growth driver for us."",
  ""I would just add to that."",
  ""If you look at SG&A, we've talked for two, three quarters in a row now about sort of step-up in labor investments that we needed to make to improve the in-store customer experience."",
  ""We've seen that actually manifest in an improved customer experience in the stores."",
  ""Simultaneously, we have taken cost out of the SG&A structure through some G&A actions, as well as making sure that we reduce the tasks in store, simplifying the experience for our GMs and partners in the store and, again, improving that customer experience."",
  "" for the question, Matt."",
  ""We don't typically talk about the impact of pricing."",
  ""I will tell you that the overall environment I'll comment on, the overall environment has been rational, both from a pricing standpoint and a promotional environment."",
  ""First, I'll talk in overall gross margin."",
  ""If you look at our gross margin improvement year-over-year of 130 basis points, that was with mix going against us."",
  ""So although supplies and CA was down 3% versus 5% last quarter, it was still a negative mix year-over-year."",
  ""The two biggest drivers of the gross margin improvement for the company were, number one, our cost actions taking hold and seeing improvement throughout the cost ecosystem."",
  ""Number two was that services gross margin improvement that you talked about, and that's a function of a number of things."",
  ""First and foremost would be maturation of the vet hospitals and all the great work that the team's doing there, going hospital by hospital."",
  ""And as Joel indicated in his prepared remarks, we believe we have ample opportunity to improve the profitability of the existing vet suite."",
  ""Second would be the continuation of strength in our Vetco mobile business."",
  ""So, Vetco mobile is all a – it's a volume and utilization business and we continue to actually increase the top line in that business."",
  ""And with that drags along incremental margin improvement."",
  ""And then the grooming business also remained strong for us."",
  ""We're not going to get into guiding for the rest of the year on gross margin."",
  ""I will tell you, we're encouraged by what we saw in Q3."",
  ""As I mentioned earlier, there were two fundamentals drivers in the improvement year-over-year."",
  ""Number one was the cost actions beginning to take hold."",
  ""Number two was the improvement in the services business."",
  ""And again, that's with mix going against us."",
  ""So, we are starting to see those actions take hold."",
  ""Joel talked about those being not one-time in nature, but being fundamental to our DNA and how we operate and run the company."",
  ""So beyond that, though, we're not going to give anything forward."",
  ""I would contextualize it this way."",
  ""Just as we said earlier, we're in self-help mode here."",
  ""And when we think about the market, we are not passively waiting for the market to recover in supplies and companion animal."",
  ""Part of the cost actions are in those two categories."",
  ""The assortment actions are in those two categories, and we see a lot of room for improvement for us, regardless of how the market performs overall."",
  ""I would just add one thing to that, and that's fresh frozen continues to be really strong for us."",
  ""That was up 20% year-over-year in the quarter."",
  ""So, that continues to be strong."",
  ""And I would just add, Kendall, the decision to open a handful this year was not because that's not strategic or not because we don't believe that's a short, medium and long-term opportunity."",
  ""It was made maybe because we wanted to make sure we continue to strengthen our balance sheet, generate free cash flow and get the company back in the position of strength so that we can invest in those high ROI projects going forward."",
  "" for your time and for your questions.""

41,3123228,000L92-E,2024-12-05,"[
  ""Before we start, I just want to address one matter."",
  ""Yesterday, we released our 2024 4Q and full year earnings."",
  ""Unfortunately, we subsequently discovered an error and reissued the release."",
  ""Let me turn this over to Larry to address before we proceed with the remainder of the prepared remarks."",
  ""And again, we apologize for this."",
  ""And what I usually say in-house is that we can all fail at times."",
  ""And when we do, I usually tell our organization, that's just the learning moments."",
  ""We just learn something new and that's something we should be happy with."",
  ""As Bill mentions, next week, we are hosting our Investor Day in New York City."",
  ""Today, I will begin our presentation by highlighting a few key messages, which will be core to the information you'll hear at our Investor Day."",
  ""The half-day event will be attended by our entire executive management team as well as each of the leaders of our new strategic business units."",
  ""We highly encourage in-person attendance, which will allow you to engage with our leaders one on one and deeply understand the value we are creating onto our Build to Last strategy."",
  ""Please turn to slide 4."",
  ""Over the past year, we have fundamentally changed how we operate as a company, organizing in a manner that will allow us to fully leverage our core competitive advantages and enable us to double the size of the company in the future."",
  ""Going forward, we are operating and reporting results based on our four material solutions: customized polymer solutions, durable metal solutions, sustainable fiber solutions, and integrated solutions."",
  ""Making steel drums is very different from making polymer drums, which is again different from making small plastics or tube and cores."",
  ""So, aligning operations by material solution greatly enhances our ability to leverage our five distinct competitive advantages."",
  ""First, it allows us to more efficiently utilize our robust scale and global network of facilities to be more agile and serving our customers even better."",
  ""Second, it aligns operations to capitalize on our deep subject matter technology expertise within each material solution, partnering even closer with our customers to meet their unique needs."",
  ""Third, it enables further innovation and growth of circular packaging solutions."",
  ""Fourth, it organizes our extensive portfolio of solutions in a manner that optimizes cross-selling and margin expansion."",
  ""Each of those four competitive advantages results in a fifth, all-encompassing advantage, utilizing our world-class culture to deliver legendary customer service, which drives loyalty, share of wallet increase and premium margins."",
  ""Please turn to slide 5."",
  ""The key benefit of this operating model, optimization for our investor community is enhanced visibility to the performance of the underlying products within our portfolio."",
  ""To that end, after the market closes today, we will be releasing fiscal year 2023 and 2024 recast financial highlights to assist you in understanding the new segments."",
  ""We have strong conviction in the synergies of operating this diverse, comprehensive portfolio of products, which enables us to serve our customers more fully than other industrial packaging companies."",
  ""That said, we have also made clear that the biggest growth opportunity we see from a total addressable market and end market growth perspective is in polymer based products."",
  ""This evolution has been occurring for years, and now, our polymer business is large enough to warrant individual segmentation to more clearly display the performance of those products."",
  ""This informs our decision to continue deploying capital in this space."",
  ""We also plan to grow further in our caps and closures business, which is a key integrated solution."",
  ""While smaller at present, in terms of the overall portfolio, we also expect this business to grow over time."",
  ""We'll be highlighting underlying growth expectations in each of these segments next week at Investor Day."",
  ""We will utilize the rest of this fourth quarter 2024 presentation to serve as a closing chapter of our Global Industrial Packaging and Paper Packaging and Services segments and discussing our quarterly results in the context of GIP and PPS for the final time."",
  ""Please turn to slide 6."",
  ""Over the past three years, we have fundamentally changed the way our business operates and have made significant strides on our Build to Last strategy."",
  ""We have allocated over $1 billion of capital to margin and growth accretive acquisitions, optimized our business model, enhanced and accelerated the Greif's business system into GBS 2.0 and invested in technology and innovation."",
  ""The collective impact of these changes provide us with the confidence to now announce a formal business optimization effort of at least $100 million of cost reductions to be completed by the end of fiscal 2027."",
  ""This initiative, which is a combination of SG&A rationalization, network optimization and operating efficiency gains enabled by GBS 2.0, has come as a result of the accumulated learnings of our strategic progress, acquisition integration and business model optimization."",
  ""This initiative will be supported by further investments in technology and innovation."",
  ""We plan to talk more about the drivers and impact of this program at Investor Day next week."",
  ""Now, let's turn our attention to Q4 results on slide 7."",
  ""Our business continues to operate with excellence against a historic period of industrial contraction."",
  ""Since tracking of US industrial activity began in 1948 by Institute of Supply Management, we have not seen an industrial contraction longer than the current period, which is 25 months through November."",
  ""Our performance during the protracted length of this cycle has been impressive, but it is critically important to keep this soft macroeconomic environment in minds, as Larry presents our 2025 guidance."",
  ""In the fourth quarter, it may have remained the strongest region, although volumes were down slightly on a sequential basis."",
  ""On our Q3 call, we commented on the notable, less bullish sentiment from our global customer base heading into Q4, a sentiment that has remained overall pessimistic into November and was taken into consideration when formulating our fiscal 2025 guidance."",
  ""That said, we are still outperforming market expectations in EMEA, which we attribute not to any specific end market, but rather to our ongoing business model optimization that is driving increased demand and cross-selling opportunities in both our polymer and metals business."",
  ""Our largest market, North America, has not seen the same recovery as EMEA."",
  ""And GIP demand remains choppy, with polymer based products continuing to offset softness in our durable metals business."",
  ""Overall, GIP North America still has significant untapped operating leverage, with volumes down almost 18% on a two-year basis in the quarter."",
  ""We fully anticipate a recovery of those volumes, which we believe are the result of this extended demand contraction cycle."",
  ""In PPS, demand has been okay, although it is still down over 4% on a two-year basis in the quarter."",
  ""Containerboard has shown a few consecutive quarters of year-over-year growth on the same-store basis and is running at over 90% operating rates, while our URB business is still mixed and is currently operating at over 80% operating rates through November."",
  ""As a reminder, APAC and LatAm are small pieces of our portfolio."",
  ""LatAm is improving while APAC has continued to be soft."",
  ""But the overall offset of those regional demand factors is about neutral on a year-over-year basis in the quarter."",
  ""And with that, I will turn things over to Larry on slide 8 to walk through our financial results."",
  "" all for dialing in today and for your continued interest in Greif."",
  ""Next week at Investor Day, we will demonstrate to you that Greif is a global market leader for essential industries, well positioned to deliver continually stronger earnings power and proactively allocating capital for the highest shareholder return."",
  ""I'm proud of the work our global teams have done since our last Investor Day to accelerate our Build to Last strategy."",
  ""And we anticipate our event next week will be compelling, insightful and a valuable use of your time."",
  ""Registration is still open and so please email our team at investorday@greif.com if you are interested in attending and that is investorday@greif.com."",
  "" for your time today."",
  ""Operator, will you please open the lines for Q&A?, and good day, everyone."",
  ""Welcome to Greif's Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call."",
  ""During the call today are Chief Executive Officer, Ole Rosgaard, who'll provide you an update on the operating model optimization effort we have undergone over the past year, which will be an important lead-in to our Investor Day next week."",
  ""He will also provide his thoughts on fiscal 2024 as well as the current market landscape."",
  ""Our Chief Financial Officer, Larry Hilsheimer, will provide an overview of our fourth quarter financial results as well as our 2025 guidance."",
  ""In accordance with regulation fair disclosure, please ask questions regarding topics you consider important because we are prohibited from discussing material non-public information with you on an individual basis."",
  ""Please turn to slide 2."",
  ""During today's call, we will make forward-looking statements involving plans, expectations and beliefs related to future events."",
  ""Actual results could differ materially from those discussed."",
  ""Additionally, we will be referencing certain non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP metrics that can be found in the appendix of today's presentation."",
  ""I'll now turn the presentation over to Ole."",
  ""Despite our usually dependable quality controls, we had an error in our original  in which we had incorrectly included $16 million of income tax expense related to a gain on the disposal of a business."",
  ""As a result, our originally reported Q4 net income, excluding the impact of adjustments, was $49.6 million, and our diluted Class A earnings per share was $0.85 per share."",
  ""As corrected, those figures are $65.5 million and $1.13 per share, respectively."",
  ""Ole, I'll turn it back to you on slide 3."",
  ""And  all for joining our call this morning."",
  ""Our fourth quarter results demonstrate our consistent ability to execute regardless of the operating environment."",
  ""Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $198 million compared to $202 million last year."",
  ""However, our business also experienced an unplanned $2 million headwind from Hurricane Helene."",
  ""Fourth quarter adjusted free cash flow was $145 million compared to $136 million last year as our teams acted decisively on the bearish demand sentiment that we identified exiting Q3 and reduced working capital to appropriate levels."",
  ""While managing results in the present, we continue to take steps towards the future."",
  ""As Ole mentioned, we finalized our operating model optimization effort, which unlocks significant new value levers Lastly, we are now just over eight months into our ownership of Ipackchem and have made significant progress on integration and synergy capture."",
  ""As we have noted in the previous few quarters, the ag sector was impacted by significant destocking in the year and has continued to operate at low volume since then."",
  ""While we have high convection in our business case financials, we anticipate that overall EBITDA contribution in the first full year of ownership will be less than that business case, which I will touch on in guidance."",
  ""Please turn to slide 9 to walk through the GIP results."",
  ""As Ole stated in his global market overview, we are very proud of the results our GIP team provided, given the uncertain and bearish demand environment we experienced in Q4."",
  ""We finished the quarter up $4 million on adjusted EBITDA dollars, but down 70 basis points on EBITDA margins."",
  ""Pricing competition has been intense in our GIP business, but our team is finding ways to win and sticking to our value over volume philosophy, resulting in resilience."",
  ""Exiting Q4, sentiment is generally pessimistic."",
  ""Please turn to slide 10 for PPS results."",
  ""Our paper business experienced an adjusted EBITDA dollar decline of $8 million and adjusted EBITDA margin decline of 240 basis points year over year."",
  ""However, EBITDA margin improved sequentially by 220 basis points as a result of some recovery of the price cost imbalance that our business has endured throughout the year."",
  ""Underlying demand in our paper business remains mixed."",
  ""Containerboard and corrugated volumes are solid, and operating rates are 90-plus percent, while URB and tube and core volumes have continued to lag due to soft paper core demand."",
  ""This is driven by the overall boxboard industry, which is generally less positive than containerboard."",
  ""We anticipate that margins in the new sustainable fiber solutions segment will continue to improve heading into fiscal 2025 due to the continued flow through of recognized paper pricing and the recent favorable OCC changes, which is contemplated in our guidance."",
  ""Please turn to slide 11 to discuss capital allocation."",
  ""Now, three years into our Build to Last strategy, we have deployed capital exactly according to the priorities we laid out in our 2022 Investor Day."",
  ""Next week, I will provide an update on our go-forward capital allocation framework, which will fuel the next evolution of growth for Greif."",
  ""Our top near-term priority is debt reduction."",
  ""Our recent acquisitions, coupled with the low EBITDA denominator in our leverage ratio calculation, resulted in a 3.53 leverage at the end of fiscal 2024 relative to our target range of 2 to 2.5 times."",
  ""When demand recovers, the EBITDA denominator will quickly scale down our ratio."",
  ""However, in the intermediate time, we will focus on paying down debt to get within our target range."",
  ""In 2019, we made an acquisition at the beginning of an industrial recession, and we were still able to pay down debt in advance of our externally stated target."",
  ""And we'll utilize that same playbook now to manage leverage during this industrial recession."",
  ""Please turn to slide 12 to discuss our fiscal 2025 outlook."",
  ""Given the continued market uncertainty and mixed demand trends, which we have commented on throughout prepared remarks today and in previous quarters, we feel it is most prudent to again present low-end only guidance to start fiscal 2025."",
  ""We have yet to see any significant inflections, positive or negative, that give us confidence in presenting a range."",
  ""It is important also to remember that we are changing our fiscal year in 2025."",
  ""Next fiscal year will be 11 months long and end on September 30, with a two-month long fourth quarter."",
  ""For that reason, our guidance was calculated on 11-month basis."",
  ""To help you understand our low-end guidance, I'd like to provide you with a few key drivers which can bridge you from 2024 on 11-month basis to fiscal 2025's 11-month guidance."",
  ""Fiscal 2024 did not have any significant seasonality impact at year end."",
  ""And so, fair comparative starting point is simply taking year-end adjusted EBITDA for fiscal 2024 of $694 million, dividing it by 12 and multiplying it by 11."",
  ""That gets you to a $636 million starting point for an 11-month 2024."",
  ""From there, we have assumed a few key tailwinds heading into fiscal 2025."",
  ""First, $83 million of price cost uplift, most of which is coming from RISI recognized paper pricing and OCC change as of the date of this call with price/cost in polymers, metals and integrated largely neutral year over year."",
  ""Second, a $19 million incremental uplift from M&A which represents the incremental ownership period of Ipackchem less the fiscal year EBITDA contribution from our disposed of Delta US business."",
  ""Third, First, a $19 million headwind from unfavorable year-over-year FX driven by the strengthening US dollar."",
  ""Second, $34 million headwind from items such as a $10 million shift from cost of goods sold into SG&A in our new operating model, which is also reflected in the operating business elements."",
  ""A $10 million increase from medical and other benefits and additional headwinds from increased IT costs due to license fees, cybersecurity investments and investments in customer digitization, which The final headwind is considered in this low-end guidance."",
  ""We also assume an incremental $86 million in manufacturing and transportation cost headwind, partially attributable to the increased volume assumption, but also factoring in incremental inflationary cost."",
  ""Those factors offset our tailwinds and bring us to the $675 million."",
  ""Remember, this is low-end guidance, so it assumes the full impact of all potential headwinds, but only explicitly known tailwinds."",
  ""With that, I'll turn things back to Ole on slide 13 to provide you with a preview of our upcoming Investor Day.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I don't want to steal too much from next week's Investor Day, but looking out for the future of the company, obviously, customized polymer solutions is going to be the focus."",
  ""But where else could we expect to see some incremental investment if it's not solely in the polymer solutions?"",
  ""And then, Larry, just regarding where you are from a leverage perspective, if you could just provide a little bit more commentary regarding how you feel about that level, given what you've been able to accomplish in the past after acquisitions in a difficult environment."",
  "" so much and best of luck in the coming year."",
  ""I guess going back to the cost-out program, $100 million over, I think you said 2027."",
  ""Can you just give us more details on how that came about?"",
  ""Is it a function of your new operating structure that allows you to target something so substantial because it is quite large relative to your EBITDA base?"",
  ""And then also, how should we think about realization timing over the next three years?"",
  ""And then also, how do the buckets – how do the savings kind of flow through across the various elements that you cited, I think SG&A, network and productivity?"",
  ""And then in terms of just as it relates to your outlook for next year, obviously, you're starting off at the low end."",
  ""And we can do the math on adjusting for 12 months versus 11, which is the construct of your guidance."",
  ""But what is the base volume assumption in there?"",
  ""Larry, you've mentioned quite a few things."",
  ""I just want to clarify as to what the starting point is for volumes across your legacy businesses, if you can."",
  ""And what gives you confidence on being able to hit that number because it seems quite large, $76 million EBITDA improvement specific to the volume component?"",
  ""Larry, I appreciate the very thorough color that you gave on the low end 2025 EBITDA bridge."",
  ""But maybe if you could help me kind of frame what would a high end scenario could look like without speculating on pricing."",
  ""Some of your peers in containerboard space have recently announced, like, price increases."",
  ""And given your independent mix and early read-throughs on demand, what are you hearing from customers in regards about passing through?"",
  ""And ultimately, what kind of price cost range could be reasonable pending any further price increases or further decrease in OCC?"",
  ""No, yeah, Ole and Larry, ."",
  ""And maybe if I could ask maybe on the polymer side of the business, so you recently opened up the IBC plant in Malaysia."",
  ""Maybe if you could discuss how initial demand is trending for that incremental capacity."",
  ""And speaking more broadly on those polymer products and you've grown both organically and inorganically, are you having to give any price for share gains on that space or on the contrary, are competitive price pressures still lingering in that business that you discussed last quarter?"",
  "" again for taking the questions."",
  ""...  How are you?"",
  ""So, I want to – you covered a little bit just now, but can you talk a little bit about the variance in Ipackchem relative to deal model?"",
  ""Can you talk about some of the underlying drivers?"",
  ""Obviously, you've covered a little bit."",
  ""Can you quantify kind of where you are with that and why you remain confident going forward?"",
  ""Secondly, I want to push back a little bit on the cost optimization."",
  ""Obviously, you spent a lot of time developing this, you quantified it, and you gave us a target by 2027."",
  ""That would suggest you have some window in terms of the cadence."",
  ""So tell us what might be able to hit the numbers for fiscal 2025 and what is giving you the biggest pause in outlining goal."",
  ""Then I had a couple of follow-ons."",
  ""I mean, I'll leave it there."",
  ""But Larry, I would assume if you have a goal that you think you can get to by 2027, you had to have been able to build that up somehow, right?"",
  ""It doesn't just show up, right?"",
  ""Listen, you're fair to say, right, we don't run  Can you talk a little bit about your tariffs and what some of the positives or negatives might be in terms of how you the volume outlook for 2025 and beyond?"",
  ""I know it's difficult, but what do you know right now that you can share?"",
  ""Net of whatever it might do for trade and obviously more trade would be better for you than worse...  Last thing and I'll turn it over."",
  ""Again appreciate all the thoughtfulness on the guidance and the buildup."",
  ""Any help you can give us in terms of how the first portion of the year, first quarter of the year will look relative to the latter quarters?"",
  ""I'm guessing it'll be a slower ramp."",
  ""It builds in terms of earnings power over the rest of the year, but anything there would be helpful."",
  ""Did you say your price increases were effective February 1 or January 1?"",
  ""I'm pretty sure you know the answer to this."",
  ""Larry, you've, I think, referenced it twice now about the $160 million of under absorbed fixed overhead."",
  ""But in the context of the $100 million savings opportunity that you laid out, some of which is, looks like, rooftop consolidation, et cetera, does that limit your way or your ability to unlock or kind of monetize that under absorbed fixed overhead from a volume standpoint?"",
  ""And then, of course, you guys can disagree, but to your point, we're 25 months into what feels like an industrial winter."",
  ""Have you guys started to do any work?"",
  ""And perhaps this $100 million is a little bit reactionary in the sense that – is there any structural change in demand that you might be seeing from your customers from – I've got three things that kind of popped into my mind, the EV transition, in other words, less lubricants and additives and different things like that for ICE engines versus EV, maybe a permanent shift in consumer preferences for experiences versus stuff, and then maybe a push towards multi-family living versus single family houses given affordability."",
  ""Listen, I mean, we'd love to see you guys unlock that $150 million."",
  ""It's just we're kind of scratching our heads trying to understand what the impediment has been from a volume standpoint."",
  ""Again... Well, I was going to go there."",
  ""I mean, I know George just kind of tried to dissect the different pieces and maybe Okay."",
  ""Maybe putting a little bit too fine a point, but you gave us some data points so I want to try to use them appropriately."",
  ""The diligence or math or EBITDA associated with Ipackchem was $57 million and the $7 million of synergies, I think you said $26 million was the contribution in fiscal 2024 and then you told us $19 million in fiscal 2025, but that was Ipackchem less Delta."",
  ""I'm seeing a $94 million inflow of cash from the sale of Delta."",
  ""Maybe that's 10 million or so of EBITDA that goes away."",
  ""So, I mean, you guys are pretty close on Ipackchem or is that not the right math?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Maybe you kind of going down the path of re-segmenting and you have a low end guidance for 2025, can you give some color around the new segments and maybe what organic growth is kind of built into that low end guidance?"",
  ""And then on the $100 million in savings, I know we've kind of gone over this a couple times, but I might just maybe ask it another way."",
  ""It's not a $100 million all coming in 2027."",
  ""So, there's something in 2025."",
  ""You don't know what that is, but you have zero in your low-end guidance."",
  ""Is that a fair statement... or is that just...?"",
  ""So, there's – again, whether it's $5 million or $20 million, I don't know, but it's something other than zero."",
  ""2024, for what, the $100 million in savings?"",
  ""But you're going to get the savings over the next three years."",
  ""There wasn't... ...any savings in 2024."",
  ""I think that was all the – all my other questions have been asked."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""This is Nicco Piccini on for Mike Roxland today."",
  ""I guess just – I apologize if I missed it earlier in the call, but does your guidance assume full implementation of the containerboard price increase?"",
  ""And then just I guess switching to URB, what are you seeing there and what are your thoughts on where pricing might go for URB?"",
  ""And then just last for me, just on index pricing in general, is there – has there been any more discussions or any thoughts around switching maybe further away from index pricing to a value-added pricing model in paper?"",
  "" for taking the follow-on."",
  ""Can you provide perhaps a bit more color on what you're seeing in the boxboard markets?"",
  ""And I was curious if I heard you correctly to one of the prior questions, you're looking for growth in URB and CRB."",
  ""And I thought you said maybe 8%, correct me if I'm wrong."",
  ""And how do I – and tube and core, you have up 4% and yet based on your answer to, I think, Nicco's question earlier, other than containerboard, you're not seeing much of a lift in any of the paper markets."",
  ""So help me put all those boxes together, no pun intended."",
  "", guys, for taking the question."",
  ""As it relates to the $100 million, you called out $86 million of inflationary headwinds this year, Larry."",
  ""And then $34 million of sort of what I see is discrete items, medical technology, things like that."",
  ""So, the question is, is that $86 million sort of a new inflation treadmill that we should think about for Greif on a go-forward basis?"",
  ""And then secondarily, are you incurring any cost, whether through OpEx or CapEx, to implement this $100 million?"",
  ""And again, I appreciate we're kind of feeling some thunder from next week."",
  ""And are there any costs, discrete costs this year in fiscal 2025 with implementing this $100 million savings?"",
  ""Obviously, polymer solutions is the primary place where we invest for growth, and that's because we can achieve margins well in excess of 18%."",
  ""And in that business, we can also achieve a free cash flow conversion in excess of 50%."",
  ""So that's why it's so attractive to us to invest in that market."",
  ""The runway that we will also demonstrate at Investor Day is very, very long in that markets."",
  ""But saying that, we still have a fiber-based and a metals-based business."",
  ""The primary investments we will do there, especially in metals, will be automation."",
  ""It will be maintaining the cash machine that that generates and automation."",
  ""And I would be remiss if I don't mention caps and closures as well, which is also polymers."",
  ""It's a relative small part of our business, but it's a very, very attractive business that we intend to expand in."",
  ""First of all, we're not fixing anything that's broken here."",
  ""So I just want to stress that."",
  ""We are very good, but we want to be even better."",
  ""That's our ambition and that's why we started the program."",
  ""So that – and as I said, it's the – the way we have now organized ourselves combined with the high level that we operate our Greif Business Systems at now and Lean Six Sigma has really enabled us to do this now."",
  ""Obviously, the first bucket is SG&A. The second bucket is network organization (sic) [optimization] (00:27:16)."",
  ""We operate 254 facilities around the world and we do believe that we can optimize that further."",
  ""And then we simply have operating efficiencies driven by our Greif Business Systems."",
  ""Paddy will talk more about the network optimization benefits in the new structure during Investor Day."",
  ""And Tim will also talk about GBS 2.0 and how we are accelerating that in the new structure."",
  ""As to when, it's difficult to say."",
  ""Obviously, we would like the $100 million to come sooner rather than later."",
  ""But we anticipate realizing the full savings as outlined before the three fiscal years out."",
  ""We won the business from the US Postal Service and that's 55,000 tons that will be the effect of that."",
  ""And just to give you an idea, Ghansham, our balance sheetfeeder's total capacity is around 120,000 tons."",
  ""So, that's a major win for us and that's a multiple-year contract."",
  ""Hey, Matt, if I can just sort of interject a few comments as well."",
  ""So, if we look at sort of the length of this volume contraction that we had and how the market operates in terms of what will drive recovery, so if you look at the underlying end markets, they remain historically low."",
  ""Existing home sales over the last two years, they have been at the lowest since 1995, I believe."",
  ""And they drive a lot home sales or housing impacts, chemicals and lubes and people buying fewer durable goods."",
  ""And then also, when you look at US auto sales, that's been below the long-term average for three years now."",
  ""And you look at the PMI, the comments I made earlier, they're still below 50."",
  ""Most of these things are interest rate driven."",
  ""And so, when the interest rate hopefully will keep going down, that will start opening up existing home sales and that will have a major effect on not only our business but our customer's business as well."",
  ""So that's one to watch."",
  ""First of all, I don't comment on individual plants, but if you look at the overall polymer space that we operate in, our chosen end segment is the premium end of that market where we can achieve margins in excess of 18%, in fact well into the 20s."",
  ""That's an important factor to mention."",
  ""The other drivers in that market is in particular in the Hey, George."",
  ""I'll let Larry answer the first question."",
  ""But before I do that, George, let me just say that when we closed the deal of Ipackchem, after that, we saw this contraction in the agrochemical markets that obviously played into our business case a little bit there."",
  ""But that's going the right way now."",
  ""And I'll let Larry go through the numbers. ..."",
  ""this is not a target we will achieve in 2027."",
  ""And no, it's one we have been working on for a while."",
  ""And so, as Larry says, it's difficult to tell you that the next quarter will be this or that."",
  ""But it's definitely not back loaded."",
  ""I can tell you that as well."",
  ""I mean, we obviously had experiences from the last time that no tariffs were imposed."",
  ""You have to remember that we, by and large, source our raw materials locally."",
  ""We produce locally and we sell to our customers locally."",
  ""And that means tariffs won't really play into our business."",
  ""If it does play into our business, it would probably be from a positive point of view."",
  ""For instance, steel tariffs means that steel prices go up, which happened last time, we saw that."",
  ""And that's something we don't calculate with but it benefits us."",
  ""So, that's sort of the net effect of tariffs."",
  ""The CAGR on – if you look at like lube, like oil quartz, the CAGR on that towards 2030 is actually over 5% and is driven by people who run their cars longer."",
  ""And EV has plateaued out."",
  ""And what you'll see grow is hybrids, which still requires lube."",
  ""So we don't see any effect of that."",
  "" I was just going to say, in terms of putting more color to that $100 million, we will be doing that at Investor Day next week actually, both Kim Kellermann and Paddy Mullaney will cover that in their presentations."",
  "" We'll get something in this fiscal year."",
  ""And just to remind you, Brian, it's 2024 – 2024 is our baseline, the 2024 fiscal year."",
  ""No, the $100 million savings is from a 2024 baseline."",
  "" You mean I mean, we're not part of that."",
  ""We are in containerboard a small player."",
  ""So, to my knowledge, there's been no developments."",
  ""So, this sort of – if we just look at, first of all, on the corrugated market, so our demand is up 2% year over year and that excludes Dallas."",
  ""And if you look at the AFPA numbers, then the industry is down 2%."",
  ""So, we've experienced growth there."",
  ""In tube and core, we're down slightly year over year."",
  ""And we're flat from a Q3."",
  ""But if you look at the ."",
  ""And  once more for your interest in Greif."",
  ""And we all hope to see you next week at Investor Day."",
  ""The thing I would supplement with that is and we've mentioned this often is we also will continue to consider downstream integrated, very profitable businesses for our paper operation, much like the ColePak transaction we did, which we are very, very pleased with."",
  ""So those are opportunities that are not as much a focal point, but we will be opportunistic on those as well."",
  ""Relative to the leverage ratio, we feel very, very comfortable where we're at right now because of the impact of this industrial recession and how rapidly we will be able to change that ratio as recovery occurs."",
  ""With a $160 million volume gap just at normal margin rates, just because of the volume reductions, that alone, if replaced, would take us down rapidly to below 3."",
  ""And the cash paydown would aggressively take us further down from there."",
  ""So, we're comfortable where we're at."",
  ""But it is a priority of – focus for us to pay down that debt ratio."",
  ""We are seeing and you have been seeing that uplift in our containerboard and corrugated business for some time now, Ghansham."",
  ""So, a good bit of that left is from the paper segment."",
  ""We have confidence that we're going to see some of the growth from the investments we've made in our intermediate bulk container business and – I'm sorry, let me go back on the paper business."",
  ""We did open our Dallas sheetfeeder business in June of this year and that is ramping up."",
  ""And we had a significant contractual win in the recent months that will contribute a lot."",
  ""Ole, what was the...  Yeah."",
  ""And that contract will be serviced not only out of Dallas, but our other sheetfeeder facilities as well."",
  ""But it was significant win, so we have great confidence in the fiber side of the business."",
  ""Our IBCs investments that we've made, we have nice growth prospects in there."",
  ""So, let me give you just broadly, $68 million, $70 million in our fiber business, $27 million roughly in our polymer solutions business across all three platforms."",
  ""However, in our metal solutions, we're actually looking at volume contraction of roughly about $19 million, $20 million, roughly, Ghansham."",
  ""So hopefully, that's helpful for you."",
  ""I mean you look at – we have that $8 million inventory cost adjustment impact that we had."",
  ""Our uplift from Ipack compared to 2024 is $26 million."",
  ""That will still leave us short of our business case, which we thought was about $57 million plus $7 million of synergies."",
  ""With the volume decreases, we are about $4 million on run rate on synergies."",
  ""That's all-volume dependent coming out of this year."",
  ""But we have high confidence in obtaining that once we get the volumes back."",
  ""The farmers are doing everything they can to manage their bottom line right now."",
  ""I mean, they're using less, diluting things, all that kind of thing."",
  ""Eventually things will come back and obviously, you have to buy things when they're for sale."",
  ""And it was a strategic buy."",
  ""And we're confident on the long-range profitability of that business."",
  ""In terms of your other question, George, I'd put this in context."",
  ""I mean, we literally just arrived at our decision to initiate this cost takeout effort in the last couple of weeks."",
  ""We announced it to our colleagues yesterday."",
  ""We have ranges on each of those three elements that Ole mentioned, but we have not identified how much we're going to be able to get done in 2025, how much will get done in 2026 and 2027."",
  ""We're extremely confident of the $100 million number over that three-year period."",
  ""We are not confident about how much in each year or how much in each bucket at this point in time."",
  ""We've built ranges, George, based on benchmarking data, based on our analysis of things we have in our Six Sigma program and all that."",
  ""But these ranges do not – have identified, okay, you can do this by this month or this year, this month, or this year."",
  ""We haven't laid all that out yet."",
  ""It gets back – you've been fair all the time in saying, look, I don't run a business, I'm not in there every day doing it."",
  ""I'd just say at this point, just respect that that's how it works."",
  ""It's hard to get in."",
  ""You got to – there's a lot more work to do."",
  ""I mean, George, usually our first quarter tends to be a slower ramp."",
  ""And obviously, with what we just announced on paper pricing, although not built into our guidance, we would clearly expect that to be recognized at some point and we then would play through on a longer basis."",
  ""Also, we do have a little bit of a drag in our metals business in the first quarter because steel prices have been decreasing since about July."",
  ""And what that tends to do is lowers our margins because as the index price changes on our price adjustment mechanism contracts, we're bleeding through slightly higher priced inventory."",
  ""So, you have a little bit of that impact in the early part of the year that will then play out positively through the rest of the year."",
  ""January 1, but they tend to roll through on a delayed basis through the contract mechanisms."",
  ""Yeah, I'd say three on – let me take those actually sort of in reverse."",
  ""So, In terms of consumer demand and that kind of thing and the shifts to experiences rather than stuff, I mean, look, that could be a long-term macro trend and that would have consequences."",
  ""I don't – haven't read anything that indicates people think that that's a long-term thing."",
  ""On EVs, the third element you mentioned, the analysis we did of that a number of years ago is the vast demand for our lubricants is not in the vehicles or it's really in machinery and industrial plants."",
  ""And ironically, within the EVs themselves, a lot of the axles and all the things that actually need lubricants, there's actually as much in an EV as there is in a historical combustion engine car."",
  ""I mean, it's not related to that."",
  ""Obviously, if our customers did something that resulted in us not needing a particular plant, we would obviously address that."",
  ""But this is not related to that in any fashion."",
  ""So, on Delta, we sold Delta for about $90 million, which was 8.5 times."",
  ""The headwind in Q4 was about $4 million."",
  ""So, the net of that is $7 million."",
  ""They were a little back ended on the results for Delta."",
  ""On Ipackchem, the lift year over year is $26 million from last year."",
  ""I think we get to, what, $42 million run rate in our low-end guidance, right, for the year for Ipack this coming year."",
  ""So, still $27 million short of our business plan, which is all demand trend driven, Gabe."",
  ""So, hopefully, that helps you."",
  ""And that $42 million is an 11 months."",
  ""Yeah, it's 11 months, obviously."",
  ""Yeah, I mean, when we look at what we're seeing in our corrugated business, a lot of the growth, as I said, is tied to the investment in our Dallas sheetfeeder kind of business."",
  ""The growth trend for our URB, CRB we've built, you've got about 8% and tubes and cores about 4%."",
  ""We've got 2% to 5% on containerboard and corrugated sheets kind of range."",
  ""Our plastics with 3% roughly."",
  ""And then like I said, in our metal solutions, it's really low single digits down."",
  ""Yeah, we don't talk on future price increases."",
  ""As we've said, the demand in that segment – operating rates have been in the 80s."",
  ""The drag is really in paper cores for most of the boxboard grades of paper."",
  ""And we haven't seen robust lift or any kind of inflection in that business, much across the rest of our portfolio being the same other than containerboard."",
  ""I think that's it, George, really."",
  ""I mean, the inflationary cost increases was our overall increase in manufacturing cost, so we had some of it's related to just volume impact that we've said."",
  ""And it's all – we're tying in all these cost increases into obviously low-end guidance but the – so you will say you've got cost that Yeah."",
  ""Most likely, there would be, I mean obviously, to the extent that things go to if we do any plant consolidations or to the extent that you do any head count moves, there would obviously be some severance related costs, that'll generate then long-term benefit obviously."",
  ""And that goes obviously into the whole equation of, do you move forward on something like that or not.""

  ""Finally, Antonio and Marie will reference our earnings presentation in their prepared comments."",
  ""With that, let me turn it over to Antonio."",
  ""We ended fiscal 2024 on solid footing and exceeded what we said we would do."",
  ""We achieved record quarterly revenue, delivered solid profitability, and generated free cash flow above our guidance."",
  ""We executed well in a dynamic environment growing revenue sequentially in each segment as investments in AI are leading to infrastructure refreshes."",
  ""In Q4, we also maintained disciplined cost management and improved non-GAAP operating profit."",
  ""A few highlights from our 2024 results."",
  ""We grew AI systems revenue more than 150% to $4.1 billion and met our Server non-GAAP operating margin target."",
  ""We continued our product transition within Storage and ended the year with Alletra MP accounting for a meaningful portion of total Storage orders."",
  ""Our transition to more software-defined storage will drive a greater mix of higher margin, recurring revenue over the long term."",
  ""Lastly, in Intelligent Edge, we rightsized our cost structure as we navigated a digestion period."",
  ""We grew fiscal 2024 revenue 3% to $30.1 billion, exceeding the high end of the outlook range we provided in September."",
  ""Non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $1.99 and free cash flow of $2.3 billion both came in above our revised outlook ranges."",
  ""In total, we returned $826 million to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases."",
  ""Overall, our results reflect focused execution and improving demand as customers implement AI strategies."",
  ""Let me dive into the details of the quarter."",
  ""We delivered record quarterly revenue and our second highest non-GAAP diluted net EPS, both of which came in above the high end of guidance."",
  ""Total revenue grew 15% year-over-year and 9% quarter-over-quarter to a record $8.5 billion."",
  ""Growth in the quarter was led by strong conversion of AI systems backlog, refreshes in traditional compute, better-than-expected performance within Hybrid Cloud, and a continued recovery in networking."",
  ""We are pleased to report non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58, above the high end of guidance, despite dilution from the issuance of our convertible preferred securities in September, which was not factored into our outlook."",
  ""ARR grew 48% year-over-year to $1.9 billion, nearly doubling since Q1 2023, primarily driven by HPE GreenLake."",
  ""We added approximately 2,000 new HPE GreenLake customers during the quarter, ending the year with approximately 39,000 unique customers."",
  ""I am happy to report continued demand for our differentiated AI system offerings, which resulted in strong double-digit sequential revenue growth to $1.5 billion."",
  ""This record contribution from AI systems revenue, combined with lower mix of Intelligent Edge, drove gross margin down 390 basis points year-over-year and 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter to 30.9%."",
  ""Non-GAAP operating expenses decreased 9% year-over-year as reported, and were down $5 million quarter-over-quarter, as we focus on streamlining our cost structure and are closely managing discretionary expenses."",
  ""Non-GAAP operating margin was 11.1%, up 140 basis points year-over-year, and up 110 basis points sequentially."",
  ""Strong profitability rolled through to free cash flow, which exceeded our expectations and totaled $1.5 billion."",
  ""Fiscal 2024 free cash flow was $2.3 billion, our highest ever for the full year."",
  ""GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.99, and non-GAAP diluted net EPS of $0.58 were both above guidance, benefiting from better-than-expected OI&E and expense management."",
  ""GAAP EPS benefited primarily from a lower-than-previously expected tax expense on our aggregated H3C dispositions."",
  ""Non-GAAP diluted net EPS excludes the gain we recognized in the partial sale of our H3C investment, and $162 million in net costs, primarily from stock-based compensation expense, acquisition and other related charges and amortization of intangibles."",
  ""Now, let's turn to the segment results."",
  ""Our Server business was a key driver of record quarterly revenue and grew double digits year-over-year for the third consecutive quarter."",
  ""Server revenue achieved an all-time high of $4.7 billion, up 31% year-over-year, and up 9% quarter-over-quarter, with sequential growth in AI systems and traditional servers."",
  ""The traditional compute business continued its momentum during the quarter and grew sequentially for the fourth consecutive quarter, driven by ongoing refreshes to our Gen11 server products, which carry higher AUPs."",
  ""Adoption has been strongest in North America and Europe, as customers are investing in new workloads."",
  ""In the fourth quarter, Gen11 accounted for more than two-thirds of our core compute revenue and contributed to AUP growth."",
  ""In AI systems, we continued to grow the business to new highs."",
  ""AI systems orders during the quarter were in line with our expectations at approximately $1.2 billion."",
  ""However, we had an order de-book in Q4, leaving our net orders for the quarter at approximately $500 million."",
  ""Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we have received orders that bring our current backlog to over $3.5 billion."",
  ""As we have mentioned before, AI systems orders can be lumpy, and this is an example of that."",
  ""Fourth quarter Server operating margin was 11.6%, up 150 basis points year-over-year and up 80 basis points quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""Moving to Hybrid Cloud, we grew revenue 18% year-over-year and 21% quarter-over-quarter to $1.6 billion, materially exceeding our guidance of a slight revenue increase."",
  ""Revenue growth was led by Private Cloud and the continued ramp of Alletra MP."",
  ""During the quarter, we received our first orders for Private Cloud AI as we target a growing pipeline that includes corporations across verticals and regions."",
  ""Interest is strong in manufacturing, education, and financial services."",
  ""We have also deployed Private Cloud AI internally and are moving use cases from the public cloud due to better cost, performance and compliance."",
  ""In Storage, we are balancing investments in owned IP products against market trends."",
  ""Alletra MP remains ahead of our expectations and is the fastest ramping storage product in our company's history."",
  ""Keep in mind, these sales carry a higher portion of deferred software and services revenue, which takes longer to translate to the P&L, but benefits margins long term."",
  ""Hybrid Cloud operating margin was 7.7%, up 390 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially, predominantly due to better OpEx controls."",
  ""Now, on to Intelligent Edge."",
  ""We believe the business remains on a path of recovery, and customers have largely digested excess inventories."",
  ""Total Intelligent Edge revenue was $1.1 billion, down 20% year-over-year and essentially flat quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""Sequentially, we saw growth in services, WLAN products and software, partially offset by declines in switching and campus."",
  ""Importantly, we are seeing more large deals in our pipeline, giving us confidence that demand is improving."",
  ""Keep in mind, we were still benefiting from the drawdown of networking backlog in Q1 of fiscal 2024."",
  ""Operating margin of 24.4% was down 270 basis points year-over-year, but up 200 basis points quarter-over-quarter due to lower OpEx in line with our expectations."",
  ""Our Financial Services business generated $893 million of revenue, up 2% year-over-year and up 1% quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""Financing volumes increased 41% year-over-year to a new all-time high of $2.1 billion."",
  ""Our Q4 loss ratio remained steady near 0.5%, and return on equity totaled 17%."",
  ""Operating margin was 9.2%, up 120 basis points year-over-year, and up 20 basis points quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""Moving to cash flow and capital allocation."",
  ""We generated strong operating cash flow of $2 billion and free cash flow of $1.5 billion in the quarter, both of which exceeded our expectations due to higher revenue and increased collections."",
  ""For the full year, free cash flow was a record $2.3 billion, above our guidance of $1.9 billion."",
  ""Q4 cash conversion cycle was a negative 12 days, down 8 days from Q4 2023 and down 16 days from last quarter."",
  ""Inventory ended the year at $7.8 billion, up 2% quarter-over-quarter due to the nature of our AI systems business."",
  ""We have focused on reducing inventory during fiscal 2025 as we convert AI systems backlog and grow our Storage business."",
  ""During Q4, we returned $169 million via dividends and $50 million via share repurchases to common shareholders, respectively."",
  ""We returned a total of $826 million during the full year."",
  ""Moving to our outlook for fiscal Q1 2025."",
  ""As Antonio said, we expect to close the Juniper transaction in early 2025, at which time we will provide combined company guidance for fiscal 2025."",
  ""However, let me provide some high-level thoughts as to how we are thinking about the upcoming year."",
  ""Overall, customer conversations indicate higher IT spending in 2025 with multiple tailwinds that should contribute to revenue growth."",
  ""We expect continued recovery in traditional compute and growing adoption of AI systems by enterprises and sovereigns, although we expect orders to remain competitive and lumpy."",
  ""In Hybrid Cloud, we are beginning to see customers accelerate digital transformation projects in order to execute on AI strategies, and in networking, we expect demand will modestly recover throughout the year."",
  ""For the first quarter, we expect year-over-year revenue growth to be in the mid-teens."",
  ""On a sequential basis, this is in line with normal seasonality."",
  ""We expect Server revenue to be down quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""We expect flat to modest growth sequentially in traditional compute and lower AI systems contribution following a very strong quarter."",
  ""Server operating margin will be closer to 10% to 11%, as customers navigate the transition to next-gen GPUs."",
  ""At Hybrid Cloud, we expect a sequential decline in the first quarter due to stronger-than-seasonal growth in Q4, with operating margin in the mid-single digit range."",
  ""And in networking, we are still managing prolonged sales cycles and expect the business to be around historical seasonality of flattish sequential growth."",
  ""We expect Intelligent Edge operating margin to be in the low-20% range due to mix."",
  ""Gross margin will benefit from a more favorable revenue mix, and we expect a modest sequential decrease in OpEx."",
  ""OI&E is expected to positively contribute to the bottom line, with higher net interest income more than offsetting $0.02 of headwinds associated with the costs of our Juniper financing."",
  ""Overall, we estimate Q1 GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.31 and $0.36 and non-GAAP diluted net EPS to be between $0.47 and $0.52, based on 1.4 billion diluted weighted average shares outstanding, including $76 million of dilution from our convertible preferred securities."",
  ""For free cash flow, we typically consume cash in the first quarter."",
  ""We intend to procure components needed to meet current and future AI systems demand, while continuing to manage inventory."",
  ""For Q1, we intend to buy back shares of common stock at a similar pace to Q4."",
  ""We remain committed in the long term to our balanced capital allocation framework, our dividend and our investment-grade rating."",
  ""In summary, we delivered strong Q4 results and entered fiscal 2025 well-positioned to drive profitable growth and generate free cash flow that we can reinvest into the business while also returning capital to shareholders."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it over for Q&A.""
]","[
  ""Yes,  so much and congrats on the strong quarter and guide, especially given the dilution from the preferred stock."",
  ""As we look at your AI business, can you maybe give us some sense of how your AI pipeline is shaping up, given that the backlog levels kind of dipped in the quarter?"",
  ""And I know you made some comments about how it's back up intra-quarter, but can you give us some sense of how the pipeline looks and what the composition of that could be?"",
  "", and congrats on the quarter."",
  ""Maybe diving into AI – or into gross margins, can you just talk about some of the puts and takes on maybe particularly server margin this quarter and just the weight of some of the XD serves versus El Capitan recognition or just some of the dynamics that play on gross margins would be helpful?"",
  ""I was hoping I could ask a two-parter on the AI servers."",
  ""First, can you just clarify that de-book comment that came in?"",
  ""It sounds like $700 million de-book of backlog."",
  ""Was that competitive loss or someone had double-ordered or something else that was going on there?"",
  ""And then the second part, following on the gross margin, can you talk a little bit about – when you're looking at AI business, what are the metrics you're looking at?"",
  ""Do you have thresholds for gross margin or cash flow or something else that prohibits you from going at certain deals where maybe ODMs or lower-gross margin OEMs would go?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""I guess, if I just look at it, at the corporate level, you've had couple of quarters where gross margins have been down a fair bit year-over-year."",
  ""It was down like 390 basis points this quarter."",
  ""Could you just talk about like, A, what's driving this gross margin degradation for you folks?"",
  ""But it clearly looks like you're able to offset all of this with some really good OpEx controls."",
  ""Maybe just talk about what's driving the gross margin decline and then how low can you take OpEx at this point, given your expectations for revenue growth in the next fiscal year."",
  "" for taking the question."",
  ""I think in your commentary on the outlook, you indicated that traditional servers would be flattish to even slightly up sequentially in the January quarter, which I think defies seasonality."",
  ""So, I just want to verify if I got that correct, maybe if you could unpack what's happening in that part of the business."",
  "" for taking the question."",
  ""Antonio, kind of building off of that last comment."",
  ""I'm curious, as we think about the Blackwell platform cycle ahead of us, and your comment on the Blackwell build that you're seeing, can you just update us where – I think a lot of that initial demand seems to be centered around the GB200 NVL, that rack-scale system – where does HPE stand on that platform, shipping those system configuration?"",
  ""When do you think that those would ship in volume for HPE?"",
  ""I'm not sure if you said it, but perhaps you can just confirm."",
  ""Did your AI pipeline grow sequentially?"",
  ""And then on the Hybrid Cloud side, it was a huge jump sequentially, dramatically higher than your guidance as well, and the biggest sequential increase we've ever seen."",
  ""Was there any unusually large deal in there?"",
  ""I know you closed Morpheus also, but I don't think that was really material."",
  ""Can you add any color about whether there was anything unusual?"",
  ""Did you pull forward deals and hence you think next quarter is going to be seasonally weaker than usual?"",
  ""But again, there was an enormous differentiation relative to normal history and your own guidance."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""If I can change gears here a bit and Intelligent Edge, you talked about the strong order patterns, but when I look at the revenue performance in the quarter, I know you were up modestly, but it did seem like, overall, from – at least relative to some other peers that have reported, sequentially, growth was a bit more limited relative to sort of quarter-over-quarter increases here."",
  ""So, I mean, is there – of how you're thinking about sort of the next year playing out, and when you look at order trends, are they coming in as expected or are you seeing a bit more weakness than what you would have expected maybe 90 days ago?"",
  ""And within that portfolio, how are you thinking about where, as you said, enterprises are going to spend more relative to their IT budgets, what are you hearing from them in terms of priorities within that portfolio?"",
  "" for the [Technical Difficulty] (00:53:20)."",
  ""Antonio, can you dig in a little bit into the de-platforming of the orders?"",
  ""You mentioned risk, but can you get into specifics in terms of what was the definition of risk and how do you think about AI orders going forward?"",
  ""I know it's lumpy, but just trying to get a sense for what was particularly risky about that orders, and how should we think about that going forward?"",
  ""Hey,  so much for taking the question."",
  ""You sounded fairly constructive around IT spend, particularly heading into 2025."",
  ""So, I'm just wondering, what's changed, if anything, over the last three months, mainly in terms of macro backdrop."",
  ""And I guess more specifically, have you seen any pickup or change in behavior post-election?"",
  "" for squeezing me in."",
  ""The Enterprise Services on the AI side of things, it looks like you continue to book services there on your orders."",
  ""Just if you can double click on that relative to where you were last quarter, what kinds of services, is that a growing percentage of your orders, revenues, and where is HPE winning as you look at those services pipeline as well?"",
  ""The pipeline is a multiple of the current backlog, which we share as of a day ago, which is basically more than $3.5 billion."",
  ""And inside our pipeline, obviously, remember, there is four key segments of the market."",
  ""Obviously, the biggest driver continue to be, what I call, segment one, or model builders, hyperscalers as well as now the Tier 2, Tier 3 that they are in the business to provide GPU capacity on demand on a per-hour basis."",
  ""So, they continue to be the two biggest driver."",
  ""But what I'm really pleased, and Marie and I made those comments in our remarks, is the fact that we see now the enterprise AI pipeline continue to grow steadily."",
  ""There are hundreds of customers on that pipeline."",
  ""The size of the deal will vary, obviously, because it's not the same size of the deal of the other two segments."",
  ""But there are some very interesting large size deals in the pipeline, and they are doing proof of concept."",
  ""But the positive news is that remember that we made the announcement of the offer, that co-engineered solution with NVIDIA in June, and we made it available only on September 9."",
  ""So, really, we had seven weeks to be able to collect orders."",
  ""We already collected orders in enterprise AI and we already closed deals in enterprise AI."",
  ""And two weeks ago, we made additional enhancement to that offer, particularly with the partner ecosystem, including Deloitte."",
  ""So, very pleased it's going to be a growth driver in 2025 as we go forward."",
  ""And then, on the first segment, obviously, the transition, I would say, to the latest GPUs that will happen over the course of the next few quarters."",
  ""But in addition to what Marie said, Meta, is this was the third consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year orders growth in the traditional server."",
  ""And when I think about the opportunity ahead of us, there are, just for HPE, 0.5 million units in the installed base that must be refreshed for several reasons."",
  ""Number one, they are doing very little work and consuming a lot of energy."",
  ""Number two is because they have reaching – or they are reaching their depreciation cycle."",
  ""And when enterprise customer think about deployment of AI, they need to free up space, power, and cooling to absorb this new system."",
  ""So, this is a big opportunity for us both from a units perspective and, obviously, Gen11 comes with a different configuration, as Marie said, and then the services touch that comes with it."",
  ""And  for the question."",
  ""As we said before, orders during the quarter were in line with our expectations."",
  ""In fact, we booked $1.2 billion of new orders in Q4."",
  ""However, we de-booked a large order, which was $700 million during the same quarter because we had concern with a specific customer."",
  ""And we pride our-self of a very strong control in this environment, and we continue to be very vigilant about how we engage and making sure we manage the risk."",
  ""And we felt that order carry a lot of risk, and therefore, we felt it was very prudent to de-book it and focus on other areas of the business."",
  ""And that's why, as we keep going throughout the next few weeks, up to yesterday, we ended up with a backlog now, which is more over the $3.5 billion."",
  ""It has nothing to do with competitive, it has nothing to do with everything else."",
  ""We had the concern with a specific customer and we decided it was prudent to de-book it."",
  ""Also, Simon, obviously, in addition to the traditional yearly seasonality, now we have gone back to the normal seasonality we used to have few years ago when, yeah, just the COVID and the recovery that happened after that."",
  ""On the AI side, one-third – more than one-third of our backlog is Blackwell related."",
  ""And so, you need to consider that the trajectory of that – that more than $3.5 billion being Blackwell related, you need time to convert that into revenue."",
  ""And that's why Marie mentioned of the lumpiness of revenue conversion sometime on the orders intake."",
  ""But notwithstanding, we are very pleased with the revenue we had in Q4."",
  ""We're confident about the continued growth in 2025 as we transition the GPUs to this new type of silicon."",
  ""Yeah, I think you're right, Aaron."",
  ""I think – again, in the segmentation, I like to operate within the segment one and two, call it, service provider, hyperscalers and model builders, they tend to lead with the latest technology."",
  ""And that transition is going to happen over 2025."",
  ""And so, obviously, we are working with the customers and NVIDIA as they become available, and we will be shipping those in volume in 2025."",
  ""And so, you think about calendar year, right, I will say in the first half of 2025 is when you start seeing growth in that platform."",
  ""In the sovereign space, I don't think that's the case."",
  ""I think it's a mix of multiple configurations because they are different type of workloads."",
  ""And then in enterprise, I argue it will be an n-1 or 2 because the enterprise is less about Blackwell or Grace Blackwell, is more about the simplicity of the deployment and the time to value."",
  ""And that's why when you look at today our HPE Private Cloud AI is all now based on H100."",
  ""And so – and that's plenty for what they do, whether it's ragging a model or fine-tuning a model or doing inferencing."",
  ""So, that's why you can generalize things here."",
  ""But it's fair to say people in the business to build and train models will lead with the latest technology, and they will transition in the first half of 2025, and then the enterprise will stay one or two generations behind, because, obviously, they'll need all that computing power."",
  ""Yeah, Marie, you want to take... I'll just add a couple of things there, Toni, and before I answer the AI question."",
  ""So, first of all, the – we now see the result of many, many quarters of hard work in Hybrid Cloud."",
  ""And remember, Hybrid Cloud is led by the GreenLake platform plus storage plus all the ancillary services."",
  ""And Alletra MP storage today is the fastest ever product ramp in the history of the company, already on $1 billion annualized basis."",
  ""And remember, that platform actually could be higher."",
  ""But remember, a portion of that revenue gets deferred because it's a subscription of the software to the infrastructure."",
  ""And that's why I'm so excited with the focus of our platform, including the latest introduction with Storage MP X10000, because that addresses the AI needs at scale, particularly exabyte scale for unstructured data."",
  ""The second piece I'm really proud – and by the way, on our later MP, we sold already 3,000 new systems."",
  ""On the GreenLake, obviously, the platform has 39,000 customers."",
  ""Throughout the year, we added more than 9,000 new logos to HPE."",
  ""And now with Morpheus Data and OpsRamp, Zerto on this – the ransomware protection, plus the GreenOps, the FinOps, people realize that GreenLake is a true hybrid by design and is core how we deliver infrastructure and the software that comes with it."",
  ""So, that's what's driving the growth in the Hybrid Cloud space."",
  ""And more to come there because also Aruba has a huge component of subscription through the GreenLake platform."",
  ""And then on the AI, yes, the pipeline grew quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""And as I said, it's a multiple of the current backlog at more than $3.5 billion."",
  ""But also, the composition of the pipeline keeps shifting."",
  ""And my – what I'm really pleased is that the enterprise side has grown very rapidly on the back of the offer then – now it's available for ordering for customers."",
  ""Absolutely, and  for the question."",
  ""So, as I said in my remarks, we had the third consecutive order growth in Intelligent Edge."",
  ""But you don't see yet fully translating to revenue, which looks like more flattish."",
  ""And in fact, that's the case for even Q1, is because the growth areas that accelerated are very much subscription based."",
  ""So, this is SD-WAN with SASE, call it, the SASE framework, had a very nice quarter."",
  ""The second is, the subscription services to HPE GreenLake Aruba Central, which is very important in the way you manage that infrastructure."",
  ""But we're now seeing is also customers placing orders for future quarters related to Wi-Fi 7."",
  ""And as we look at that, what I'm very excited is that when you upgrade your access points, at some point, you also need to upgrade your campus switching."",
  ""And the reason why is necessary because the access points are power over Ethernet from the switching port."",
  ""But today, I will say the one area has not yet fully returned to what we want to see is the campus switching itself."",
  ""And then last but not least, data center networking using more intelligent features that our CNX platform brings to table has had double-digit growth again."",
  ""And so, that's why I'm excited about the combination with Juniper Networks, because bring complementarity to that portfolio."",
  ""And when I look at AI, I see three unique opportunities."",
  ""Number one, the interconnectivity within data center to data center, that requires basically a big router."",
  ""And obviously, Juniper already has a leading platform with 100 gig."",
  ""Once you are inside the data center, you need a high-performance fabric, you need to lay the pipes inside the data center to be able to connect rack to rack and row to row."",
  ""And then inside the rack itself, you need a high-performance connectivity."",
  ""This is why the HPE Slingshot 400-gig that we just announced two weeks ago is playing a massive role, especially as customers will consider other type of silicon in that environment, and you need an open architecture, and that's what HPE Slingshot brings on."",
  ""But I believe the market is on recovery."",
  ""Three data points already, three quarters of growth, and this is what I believe in the context of what Marie just said early on, on the question of margins and contribution of each of the businesses, I argue the networking is the biggest upside HPE will have in 2025 and 2026."",
  ""I mean, listen, we look at the customers from a variety of angles."",
  ""Obviously, the ability to verify end user ability to obviously fulfill the payment of the orders and risk associated with allocated components and the like."",
  ""And we felt that particular order had a lot of risk and we decided not to fulfill it because of our stringent controls."",
  ""And my view is that this was the right thing to do."",
  ""Well, first of all, Matt, welcome."",
  ""Pleased to have you here."",
  ""So, the macro environment versus a year ago has improved, no question whatsoever."",
  ""Obviously, they're unique areas where the customers are paying more attention."",
  ""Focus on AI clearly is very high on the agenda."",
  ""Focus on implementing a more flexible hybrid model because AI at the core is a hybrid workloads and a data-intensive workload."",
  ""Definitely, that's another big area."",
  ""In both of those spaces, HPE has the right to play and win with our unique focus on innovation."",
  ""I think, obviously, cyber continue to be very important, but then also is by geography maybe varies a little bit."",
  ""But as I said earlier, in Server, we are on the cycle for modernization and improved efficiency of footprint cost per workloads."",
  ""I talk about the TCO per workloads and as well as the power consumption."",
  ""A lot of focus on sustainability."",
  ""This was very obvious to me, Matt, when I was two weeks ago in Barcelona."",
  ""We had the biggest conference ever in Europe with more than 4,500 customers, all very keen to understand our solutions in the context of sustainability."",
  ""And then, one of the areas – again, I will reinforce what I said earlier, networking needs to catch up to the demands of AI."",
  ""And that's why we believe that the combination of HPE and Juniper is so important to drive that next wave of innovation."",
  ""But networking clearly is going to be a topic for 2025 and beyond."",
  ""So, that's what we see."",
  ""When I speak to customers, which I do more than 50% of the time, the AI is pretty much focused – the enterprise side is very much focused about business productivity and time to value."",
  ""And, even in our case, right, we have many, many, many, many use cases which many already deployed, in production, which allows us to do some of the things that Marie talked early on in efficiency and cost reduction."",
  ""And that's the excitement, which means the opportunities are yet to come at much bigger scale."",
  ""And if I want to wrap my commentary about why we are delivering the performance we have delivered in Q4, I will use only one word, innovation."",
  ""Our strategy is an innovation-driven strategy that makes us more relevant, that eventually customers buy more from us that increases value for shareholders."",
  ""So, for me, it's a testament that the strategy is working."",
  ""And then as I look at these megatrends and the customer needs, we are uniquely positioned even with the pending Juniper acquisition to address those needs."",
  ""Well,  for the question."",
  ""Our services orders related to AI went up quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""So – and the type of services customers are looking for is you can use two different ways to think about it."",
  ""The day zero, day one and day two."",
  ""The day zero is where you help customers define the use cases, define the return on investment and the like."",
  ""The day one is where you design and implement, and the day two is to run it."",
  ""And HPE is uniquely positioned in all these three days, if you will."",
  ""And therefore, we see quite a bit of engagement upfront, but also the partnerships with companies like Deloitte, and I mentioned that, are so important to reach customers to bring more a business process-oriented approach."",
  ""We also focus on additional AI practices."",
  ""And we have many other conversations, by the way, you will hear more about that in the next few weeks, few announcements there."",
  ""And then, obviously, on design and implementing and running, HPE has all the capabilities that we need."",
  ""But on the designing and implementing, this unique approach with Private Cloud AI has proven to be the right value proposition because many of these enterprises don't have the time, don't have the expertise, and they want a partner that can help them do that."",
  ""And then on the runtime, many of these instances will not land in their own data center, will land into, what I call, co-locations, and HPE already has three disposition enterprise stacks with our Private Cloud AI so that they can turn it on when they're ready to deploy those use cases."",
  ""And that's why we should expect continue improvement on the services side, which is the source for gross margin as we go forward."",
  ""Well, we are right on time, and I want to thank everyone for participating today."",
  ""Again, very, very pleased with our results in Q4, capping off a very strong year."",
  ""You can see the momentum of revenue, operating profit dollars."",
  ""We did what we said."",
  ""I mean, that's fundamentally the bottom line."",
  ""And we had a record number of metrics there."",
  ""But I'm excited about 2025."",
  ""I think we have an amazing set of assets that will continue to drive profitable growth and drive shareholder value."",
  ""And the pending Juniper acquisition, as I said in my remarks, we're working through the process, we're confident this will close in the early part of 2025, and we are working very, very collaborative with the DOJ."",
  ""So, nothing gives me pause that will not happen."",
  ""So, if I don't speak to you, happy holidays to you and your family and we'll reconvene in early 2025.Okay, , Wamsi."",
  ""And first of all, I'll just add up by saying, as you know, we typically don't get into gross margin at the segment level, but let me give you some color around how we think about our op margins."",
  ""First of all, I'd say, look, from a Server segment perspective, really pleased with the performance in the quarter."",
  ""And if you think about it, we actually had our highest ever AI server revenue of $1.5 billion."",
  ""So, I think you can see just the performance there."",
  ""In terms of the color and how to think about it, El Capitan, actually, was included in the quarter."",
  ""So, we did actually get the final acceptances."",
  ""A couple of points to note."",
  ""If you look at the mix inside server, we see traditional compute, particularly Gen11 were about two-thirds of the mix so far to-date, and that particularly has higher configurations and as a result is driving richer AUPs and obviously higher structural margins."",
  ""And also, frankly, we've been really successful about passing over commodity costs."",
  ""And if you look at both the GPU servers, it is competitive where you can see the revenue scale is helping us out there."",
  ""And then finally, I think, Meta, we've been really prudent with our cost controls and all of that's playing off in terms of our OpEx discipline."",
  ""So, that's how we're thinking about server margins."",
  ""And, Tim, just to add on how we think about margin structure on AI systems, I think we've said this in the past."",
  ""But, look, we have a framework that we use for our pricing."",
  ""And it's absolutely our intention to remain disciplined both on cost and price as we pursue profitable growth."",
  ""I think that has been our mantra."",
  ""But, obviously, then, we're out there balancing those gross margin pressures with cost controls, strategic buys, and you've seen that in terms of our pricing discipline."",
  ""And I would add, and I think Antonio made this comment earlier, that we do see over time improving profitability as the market moves more to, I think, the two sectors that Antonio referred to both in terms of sovereign and enterprise, where we see services attach and et cetera."",
  ""So, just use that as a way to think about the longer term sort of margin structure as well."",
  ""So, why don't I take that one?"",
  ""On gross margin, so for Q4, as you rightly said, it was 30.9%."",
  ""So, we were down both on a year-on-year and a Q-on-Q basis."",
  ""If you step back and look at the overall revenue mix, perhaps one of the largest drivers is really just the lower contribution of the Intelligent Edge revenue."",
  ""And in fact, in Q4, Amit, it was actually the lowest for the entire year."",
  ""And, obviously, we had a higher contribution inside of servers of AI systems revenue and product mix."",
  ""So, that obviously impacted gross margin."",
  ""But what I would say is, despite that headwind, we actually grew gross profit dollars both year-on-year and Q-on-Q. Now, going forward, I think I said in my prepared remarks that we do actually expect to see gross margin will be up modestly in terms of the improved business mix and predominantly that's driven by the Intelligent Edge mix."",
  ""But from a longer-term perspective, there's two things to keep in mind."",
  ""First of all, obviously, when we close Juniper, that is going to be a big driver, has a very positive impact on both gross and operating."",
  ""We expect about 50% of operating profit going forward will come from Juniper."",
  ""And secondly, as I mentioned earlier, I think when I answered Tim's question, we do expect, particularly in the AI space, those higher-margin opportunities as we move more into seeing the adoption of sovereign and enterprise."",
  ""On the costs side of the house, really pleased with the work we've done so far to-date."",
  ""We've been really focused on discretionary costs throughout 2024."",
  ""We're moving more into areas in productivity, Amit."",
  ""As we look at 2025, we're actually using GenAI inside the company, using it in finance to help drive productivity."",
  ""So, we see opportunities like that throughout the company."",
  ""I would just say at a company as large as HPE, there's plenty of opportunity, Amit."",
  ""So, this is Marie here, Simon."",
  ""So, yes, you did get that correct in terms of servers."",
  ""And I think I did mention in my prepared remarks that we did see a lower AI mix in terms of server systems in Q1."",
  ""And I think as we've said in the past, this business is lumpy."",
  ""So, you just bear that in mind as you think about it."",
  ""In terms of traditional servers and the outlook on the business, really nothing's changed."",
  ""We continue to see the momentum in that business."",
  ""I think Antonio described it very well earlier when he mentioned two-thirds of the mix is already at Gen11 and traditional servers, and we see that continuing."",
  ""So, don't expect that to change fundamentally."",
  ""But just remember, it's a pretty competitive environment out there, for both traditional servers and AI systems right now in the market."",
  ""So, that's the way I'd sort of think about it."",
  ""So, that's why we felt it was prudent, given the current backlog, we've got to guide 10% to 11% right now."",
  ""Why don't I just address Hybrid Cloud, Toni?"",
  ""Look, first of all, I'd start out and say, look, we're really pleased with the performance of Hybrid Cloud in the quarter."",
  ""And as you mentioned, revenue was up almost 18% year-on-year and 22% quarter-on-quarter, so really strong growth."",
  ""It was really driven by both Private Cloud and, frankly, just the ongoing adoption of HPE Alletra MP storage."",
  ""So, I think both of those were just great drivers of contribution."",
  ""I think you see in the deck there – from the investor deck, we had 39,000 customers in GreenLake, and our MP storage, I think, is one of the fastest adoptions ever in the history of the company."",
  ""So, I think you're starting to see those benefits pass through."",
  ""And in fact, ARR was up 48% as well."",
  ""So, overall, really good on the top line and, frankly, pleased with the trajectory from a margin perspective as well, as you rightly said."",
  ""We're continuing to scale the business, manage our cost structure, all of that's paying off."",
  ""And the Q1 guide actually does continue some of the momentum on the margin."",
  ""We expect that to be relatively sequentially flattish."",
  ""And given the strong Q4, we do expect to have a modest sort of decrease in revenue, which is more in line with the sequentials on Hybrid Cloud."",
  ""So, overall, I think very pleased and want that trajectory to continue, Toni."",
  ""I'll turn it over to Antonio now."",
  ""And I'd just add, look, HPE has a very strong controls environment."",
  ""And as we've said before, orders and backlog are subject to the booking push-outs and cancellations prior to rev-rec."",
  ""So, we maintain those tight controls."",
  ""Operator, one more question, please?"",
  ""That was our last question.""

43,3125448,0HKMNP-E,2024-11-12,"[
  ""During today's call, I will highlight the many recent accomplishments in our commercialization strategies for IB-Stim, which is our IBS neuromodulation technology, and RED, our pending product for patients with evacuation disorder."",
  ""We will discuss the milestones and growth plans for the remaining months of 2024 and into 2025 as we come off another strong quarter of execution and continue the commercialization of our market leading PENFS technology."",
  ""Following my remarks, Tim Henrichs, our CFO, will review our financial results for the third quarter of 2024."",
  ""Let's first review the recent achievements."",
  ""As I just mentioned, we are coming off a very strong quarter of year-over-year growth, the biggest milestone in the company's history, and a new FDA indication expansion."",
  ""To highlight the three big announcements, we grew 40% year-over-year in Q3."",
  ""We received notice of our Category I permanent CPT billing code, and received FDA clearance for an age expansion from 11 to 18 to 8 to 21 years of age nearly doubling our market opportunity."",
  ""I will speak in much more detail later in the call about all three announcements."",
  ""We are continuing to execute at a high level on our growth objectives rooted in the foundation that strong published data will drive insurance expansion, leading to sustainable revenues and margins."",
  ""We laid out these objectives in previous calls and continue to put the final pieces in place to allow blanket insurance coverage and in turn, the scaling of PENFS revenues."",
  ""In recent months, we have made significant achievements as we advanced and hit milestones with a goal of cash flow breakeven."",
  ""Regarding IB-Stim, we are primarily focused on revenue trajectory and we had a significant change from Q1 to Q2 and even a larger positive year-over-year change in Q3 as children's hospitals get more comfortable with billing and coding."",
  ""We also saw the very beginning of new insurance policy coverage taking effect."",
  ""As such, I'm excited to share with you that our momentum in Q3 has continued into Q4 and thus far the quarter is off to a very good start."",
  ""I now want to focus on and highlight the catalyst for what we expect to be significant revenue growth in the coming quarters."",
  ""In a perfect world, the children's hospitals could access blanket insurance policy coverage and a Category I CPT code."",
  ""As mentioned earlier, the Category I CPT code has been awarded by the American Medical Association CPT Panel and will become effective January 1 of 2026."",
  ""Regarding blanket insurance policy coverage, we went from 4 million covered lives on January 1 to about 35 million covered lives today, and we continue to announce new policies regularly."",
  ""So what does it take to earn the remaining payers?"",
  ""As we all know, the scientific community has accepted our flagship technology, but has been hindered by a lack of written insurance policy coverage."",
  ""The largest payers have been waiting on the academic society to publish guidelines for FAP/IBS."",
  ""The most important recognition any medical technology can receive is independent guidelines by the academic society, because this is an independent review of the literature and a grade is assigned which the payers accept as the standard."",
  ""We announced in the last call that a systematic review by the academic society NASPGHAN was released at a conference in late May, showing our technology has the highest grade This systematic review is in abstract form now, but we believe this information is the work being used to publish guidelines in the coming months."",
  ""We are told by the largest payers that this publication is an internal mandate for policy coverage."",
  ""So, we are eagerly waiting for this publication to get it to the payers."",
  ""Sticking with insurance policy coverage, I want to go into detail about the most important aspect of our growth."",
  ""As we stated late in 2023 and early in 2024, written policy coverage is the key to revenues significantly increased."",
  ""We also stated that once the insurance policy coverage is written and in place, the children's hospitals who were not already utilizing IB-Stim take a minimum of 120 days to get the technology loaded, their processes is in place and begin ordering."",
  ""With all of that said, I'm happy to announce we have added additional payers bringing our total covered lives through almost 30 million – to about 35 million covered life."",
  ""In addition to this announcement, we have countless payers in the review process."",
  ""Assuming even a few of those payers make positive decisions in Q4, we will exceed the 50 million covered lives number we projected early in 2024."",
  ""We have many children's hospitals that have been ordering for years, but for a variety of reasons we have not received early insurance policy coverage in those specific areas."",
  ""Once insurance policy covered is written in those specific areas, the children's hospitals are expected to increase revenue very quickly because the product is already in their system, therefore, not needing the 120 days to get set up."",
  ""Turning data into insurance policy coverage and then into revenue is a process that we believe is beginning to work well and the expected academic society guidelines will only expedite that process."",
  ""Earlier in the call, I mentioned we have achieved the company's most important milestone to date in the form of a Category I CPT code, which will allow for more seamless billing and reimbursement."",
  ""This is a permanent billing code that will become effective on January 1, 2026."",
  ""The reason this code is so critical is that it brings a permanent code, making it much easier for revenue cycle teams to build a procedure."",
  ""It will bring a permanent reimbursement amount and RVUs, which is how most physicians' productivity is measured."",
  ""Back in July, we made a submission to the FDA for the expansion of our IB-Stim label to include a patient population beyond the current 11 to 18 years old to 8 to 21 years old, nearly doubling the number of children we can treat."",
  ""We recently heard from the FDA and this expanded indication was awarded on October 30."",
  ""Regarding RED, or rectal expulsion device, our point-of-care device identifies patients with pelvic floor dysfunction and provides immediately actionable test results in patients with chronic constipation licensed from the University of Michigan."",
  ""We submitted a 510(k) in early August and we are optimistic we will begin commercialization in late 2024."",
  ""And finally, we have closed the necessary financings with reputable healthcare funds, ensuring we are well funded for the foreseeable future."",
  ""I want to focus on PENFS/IB-Stim."",
  ""I want to begin by highlighting the work we have done over the last five years to demonstrate and document the true efficacy of our therapy, which now includes 16 publications covering 10 different types of studies."",
  ""This has resulted in the highest level of evidence available for functional abdominal pain associated with IBS."",
  ""We at NeurAxis are very proud of this and believe it validates our optimism and expectations for IB-Stim."",
  ""I am excited to say that the efforts we have put in are starting to bear fruit."",
  ""Not only do we expect this abstract data to change the guidelines, but we also expect it to expand insurance coverage with the largest payers significantly."",
  ""We are beginning to see many of our achievements reflected in the numbers."",
  ""The number of treated cases has increased to about 900 patients in the last 12 months, which represents just over one-tenth of 1% of the 600,000 debilitated children in the United States who suffer from IBS and are in strong need of IB-Stim."",
  ""Now, I would like to focus on how this translates to revenue growth and why we continue to be bullish on significant revenue growth as we move into 2025 and beyond."",
  ""I want to start by highlighting the sustained and increasing demand for IB-Stim."",
  ""If you recall, revenue in Q1 was down 20% year-over-year and units were down 14%."",
  ""In the second quarter, we had a strong acceleration with year-over-year revenue declining by roughly 5% versus 20% in Q1 and total units increasing by a robust 16%."",
  ""In the third quarter, we had a stronger acceleration with year-over-year revenue increasing by roughly 40% and total units increasing by approximately 50%."",
  ""The positive change here is due to several reasons, including accounts getting more comfortable with billing and coding, physicians seeing the academic society guidelines poster stating PENFS is the highest grade of evidence and only the very slightest insurance policy coverage taking effect."",
  ""A key point to add here is that revenue loss from 2023 is from children's hospitals that needed written policy coverage from large payers, which is not yet in place."",
  ""These are children's hospitals who were treating patients after a no authorization required during the prior authorization, and then they were not paid, so they have paused treating until they get written insurance policy coverage."",
  ""Therefore, there is significant revenue paused versus lost."",
  ""The fact that we are alleviating those losses without these children's hospitals shows the growth in new and existing accounts."",
  ""Once larger payers write policy coverage at children's hospitals that are on pause, we'll begin ordering immediately, adding significant revenue."",
  ""On average, selling prices for patients receiving IB-Stim through financial assistance are roughly 65% below our list price."",
  ""The insurance barrier is causing us to leave significant dollars on the table."",
  ""As insurance coverage increases the cost across the country, the percentage of sales through purchase orders will also increase significantly."",
  ""This is why our number one priority continues to be written insurance policy coverage."",
  ""The plan of action continues to be clear."",
  ""Strong peer-reviewed publications and key society support from the likes of NASPGHAN and the American Academy of Pediatrics result in successful coverage from insurance companies, which results in strong revenues."",
  ""Our internal prior authorization team continues to be successful as it reduces the workload for clinic staff, which allows greater access for pediatric patients, and ultimately assisting in acquiring a permanent billing code."",
  ""We believe that in time, most accounts will move their prior authorization to the NeurAxis team."",
  ""We expect revenue growth to accelerate meaningfully as we move into 2025 towards cash flow breakeven based on two catalysts."",
  ""The continued gaining of coverage from insurance companies through IB-Stim and the commercialization of RED."",
  ""Regarding RED for adult patients, we recently filed our FDA submission and are cautiously optimistic about FDA clearance and commercialization commencing in late Q4."",
  ""I'll speak a little bit more about RED, or the rectal expulsion device product, which we believe to be a great opportunity for NeurAxis."",
  ""We have now officially licensed this product from the University of Michigan, where it was developed, and we recently submitted a 510(k) to the FDA and are optimistic that this product will be on the market late Q4."",
  ""If successful, RED is expected to bring great clinical benefits to patients because the technology has a Category I CPT billing code assigned to the procedure and strong national reimbursement, we believe that providers will be able to bring this clinically beneficial technology to their practice immediately."",
  ""RED is a self-inflating balloon that is an easy-to-use, office-based point-of-care anorectal function test to identify patients with chronic constipation due to pelvic floor dyssynergia and who are unlikely to improve with laxative use."",
  ""The current treatment involves much trial and error by the physician as to which treatment will work and RED will allow the physician to streamline the diagnosis and choose the best treatment option after the first visit, which is a real win for the patient."",
  ""In summary, we are pleased with continued and consistent execution of building the foundational on strong data and academic society support."",
  ""This has resulted in significant early insurance adoption, which we expect to grow revenues exponentially, moving us toward profitability and setting the stage for a prosperous 2025."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to our CFO, Tim Henrichs, to discuss financials."",
  ""In summary, we are early in what we see a strong top and bottom line growth over the next few quarters."",
  ""The consistent execution of our commercialization strategy is beginning to bear early fruits as we see from the growth acceleration in the past three quarters."",
  ""We are also achieving milestones that will enable continued growth, including receiving our Category I CPT code and the expansion of our 510(K) clearance."",
  ""Furthermore, we remain excited about our opportunity with RED, which we expect to become commercial in late 2024."",
  ""It has the potential to drive significant revenues."",
  ""With that, operator, we'll be happy to take any questions."",
  ""As a reminder, you can ask a question on the webcast by typing in Ask the Question box, or if you're dialed in and would like to ask a question, follow the operator's instructions."",

  ""The conference call today will contain certain forward-looking statements, including statements regarding the goals, strategies, beliefs, expectations, and future potential operating results of NeurAxis."",

  ""NeurAxis undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of these forward-looking statements."",
  ""With that said, I would like to turn the call over to Brian Carrico, Chief Executive Officer of NeurAxis."",
  ""And let me add my welcome to everyone joining us on this call."",
  ""These financial results were included within our press release, which was issued earlier, and were also provided in more detail within our Q3 2024 10-Q filed this morning."",
  ""I will add some color on key areas of the financial results as well as an outlook on certain areas."",
  ""The hard work that our team has put in the last few years is beginning to bear fruit."",
  ""All year we talked about accelerated growth in the back half of 2024 and now we are seeing it."",
  ""As Brian mentioned, in the third quarter we delivered strong acceleration in our revenues and units as a result of increased insurance coverage."",
  ""The good news is we are only in the early innings of our ramp as we expect the number of covered lives to continue to grow."",
  ""In addition, we are optimistic with regards to the commercialization of RED in late 2024."",
  ""As such, we expect revenue growth to continue in the fourth quarter of 2024 and into 2025."",
  ""Given our current cost structure, our goal as a company to reach cash flow breakeven is achievable and a function of our sales volume given our strong gross margins."",
  ""Our recent successes in obtaining substantially more insurance coverage keeps us on that path."",
  ""Finally, we have strengthened our liquidity position for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025, with a $5 million investment from a dedicated life sciences fund that will replace $3.2 million in committed funding from a current investor."",
  ""The transaction is expected to close mid-November and this investment will top off our 2024 capital raise activity at $11.2 million."",
  ""With that, I will go to the financial highlights in detail."",
  ""2024 third quarter revenues were $667,000 compared to $477,000 for the same period in 2023, representing a strong 40% year-over-year revenue growth."",
  ""Demand remained strong as our unit sales were up approximately 50% in the quarter year over year."",
  ""It is also worth noting that our September year-to-date revenue is now relatively flat to prior year, which emphasizes a strong third quarter given our revenue was down 20% and 5% in the first and second quarters of 2024, respectively, compared to 2023."",
  ""Such trends give us confidence for revenue growth going forward as this kind of financial assistance orders turn into full reimbursement dollars with policy coverage."",
  ""As mentioned before, we remain highly focused on expanding our insurance coverage."",
  ""Despite the inherent lag from insurance coverage device orders, which we have spoken about before, recent performance indicates strong demand and enthusiasm on the part of healthcare providers and demand patients for our product."",
  ""Gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 grew to $570,000, compared to $410,000 in the third quarter of 2023 due to sales volume."",
  ""Gross margin in the third quarter decreased 50 basis points year over year to 85.4%, although we saw a significant increase in full reimbursement units quarter over quarter."",
  ""Discounted financial assistance units outpaced the growth of the full reimbursement units, resulting in a decline in gross margin."",
  ""Notwithstanding, the company maintains a very healthy gross margin."",
  ""Our operating loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $1.7 million, compared to $3 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The sharp improvement in the operating loss quarter over quarter was due to a number of factors."",
  ""First, higher sales volume and higher ASPs, resulting in higher gross profit."",
  ""Second, 2023 included non-recurring post-IPO consulting services and incentive bonuses."",
  ""Those benefits were partially offset by incremental head count in 2024 to build out the market access, sales, and finance teams, expenses related to the introduction of an annual short-term incentive bonus plan and higher advertising costs to expand market awareness."",
  ""Our net loss in the third quarter of 2024 was $1.8 million versus an $8.6 million net loss in the third quarter of 2023, primarily due to full amortization of the debt discount and issuance costs and the extinguishment of debt in 2023 from the IPO last year, partially offset by our lower general and administrative costs that I've previously discussed."",
  ""From a liquidity perspective, our cash on hand as of September 30, 2024 was $261,000."",
  ""But to shore up our liquidity, we recently secured a $5 million investment from a life sciences focused fund that is expected to close mid-November, replacing $3.2 million in committed funding from an existing investor."",
  ""Our cash used in operations was $4.3 million and $4.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 and 2023, respectively."",
  ""The increase in cash utilization was primarily due to new public company costs due 2024, such as legal, insurance, board and stock exchange listing fees that were not incurred prior to the IPO, August of 2023."",
  ""The company held no long-term debt as of September 30, 2024."",
  ""However, we did have $140,000 short-term debt related to the financing of our annual business insurance premiums."",
  ""With that, let me turn the call back over to Brian.""
]","[
  ""First, the Category I code is the culmination of five, six, seven years of work."",
  ""It requires us an overwhelming amount of evidence and data, and it requires a significant amount of utilizations."",
  ""The criteria are strict and the bar is high, but the reason for that is a Category I essentially cements the technology into the medical foundation from the standpoint of the commercial insurance companies and state Medicaid's recognized Category I CPT codes."",
  ""The billing of a Category III code, which is what we currently have, is more difficult."",
  ""Many Medicaid's or most Medicaid's don't recognize the code which makes the prior authorization in the billing very difficult."",
  ""The commercial payers, when it comes to billing a Category III code, it requires a children's hospital, for example, to itemize the device cost, the physician time, the facility time and the supplies."",
  ""It's just a longer process and much more difficult for a chief revenue officer, the revenue cycle team to operate with."",
  ""So, the Category I code brings a recognizable code that will have all those items included in the code and the reimbursement, there will be a permanent reimbursement amount."",
  ""So, number one, it makes the code much easier to bill, and that's really what's causing the delay once we get insurance policy coverage for accounts that have not brought the technology in before."",
  ""The time to get that Category III code setup is significant, as we mentioned multiple times today."",
  ""So, it brings a very clear path with a Category I code to billing."",
  ""Number two, it will bring a permanent reimbursement amount."",
  ""So, there's a set reimbursement amount."",
  ""And number three, and probably most important, it brings our RVUs."",
  ""So, RVUs are how physicians' time is measured."",
  ""So, for example, a physician is required to earn so many or work so many RVUs throughout the course of the year, and this will bring RVUs."",
  ""Currently, if they're doing this procedure, they're not receiving RVUs, so it doesn't go towards their workload for the year."",
  ""So, they're doing this from a clinical benefit standpoint, but they're not receiving any compensation, if you will, because they're not meeting those RVUs."",
  ""So, this is extremely important when you talk about streamlining and scaling the technology."",
  ""Regarding the 510(K) extension, we're excited about the 510(K)."",
  ""It increases the age range to 8 – begin at 8 years of age up to the 21 years of age."",
  ""I can't tell you how many patients on a daily basis were contacted that are 8, 9, 10, 19, 20 or 21 years of age."",
  ""So, this is a significant improvement."",
  ""It was just an excellent quarter when it comes to the Category I code and the 510(k) extension."",
  ""So, age expansion just allows more patients to be treated and actually be on label, but the policy coverage is separate."",
  ""We still need to get written policy coverage from payers."",
  ""They still have to write policy covered to enable this."",
  ""I mean, there are still – large payers, for example, still cover this technology on it, one-off, case by case basis but to get written policy coverage, where it's an approved treatment for children, we still need to get written policy coverage with all of the payers."",
  ""You are – well, two answers to that."",
  ""One, most policies right now state that they will cover, for example, let's just choose Blue Cross Blue Shield, Massachusetts, as an example."",
  ""That policy states that they will treat patients 11 to 18 years of age."",
  ""So our market access team has already gone back to those payers and said that this age expansion has happened."",
  ""Those conversations with the payers are going very well and we expect in short order that they'll expand those patients, that age range within their policy from 11 to 18 to 8 to 21."",
  ""Now, the second part of your question is, Covered lives is reported based on how many patients there are."",
  ""For example, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Massachusetts, has 1,000 lives they cover."",
  ""I forget the exact number, it's 3 million or 4 million, but if they cover 1,000 lives, we report 1,000 lives."",
  ""Now, to your point, yes, there will be twice as – nearly double the amount of covered lives within that payer that we can now treat, that's true."",
  ""But we do need to make sure that we get the payer to change the policy from 11 to 18 and move that to 8 to 21, which we're in the process of."",
  ""And we don't see any issue or real delay in making that happen."",
  ""That's another great question, But that is in process."",
  ""The adult demand, the adult market size is obviously significantly larger than the pediatric size and there is a significant demand from the adult market."",
  ""We've been working on this for a couple of years and we believe that roughly a year from now, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to earn that indication as well."",
  ""We do and we have what we believe the necessary research underway and completed."",
  ""It's got a similar TAM."",
  ""I believe it's around just a little over $2 billion market opportunity for the TAM."",
  ""And the good news is on that product, The good news – We expect to hit the ground running immediately with this product from a revenue standpoint."",
  ""So, that's one reason we – well, we're using our W2 sales force, Twofold."",
  ""Number one, we set out beginning of the year to reach 50 million covered lives."",
  ""We also expected the guidelines to already be published, which we know there are countless payers."",
  ""We believe that policy coverage written and are awaiting on the published guidelines to be released."",
  ""And now those published guidelines are not quite out yet."",
  ""We're cautiously optimistic those will be out in January and then those other policies will come through."",
  ""Having that said, there are many payers that we believe are on the cusp of announcing policy coverage, and that could happen tomorrow or it could happen on January 2 or sometime in between."",
  ""So, it's still very possible that we have those 50 million covered lives by the end of the year."",
  ""And regarding cash flow, profitability in 2025, that's the trend, that's the goal."",
  ""And we continue to work towards that, yes."",
  ""So first, we have – the reason these guidelines are so important is because this is an independent review of the literature by the academic society, which means we have zero involvement from an ethical standpoint, a moral standpoint, we are not able to be involved, we don't want to be involved in this."",
  ""That's why the credibility is so high."",
  ""We were cautiously optimistic these guidelines would have been public in the fall, and the fact that they're not here yet, we believe that they'll be January."",
  ""And the reason for that is we're told that journals want to publish – academic journals want to publish in January because they're judged internally based on citations, and if they – during a 12-month January to December calendar year."",
  ""So, if they publish in October or November or December, they only get one or two months of citations where if they publish in January, especially something as significant as the academic society guidelines for functional abdominal pain, that gives them a full 12 months of citation, which is very beneficial to them."",
  ""Again, this is not a conversation we've had directly with the journal."",
  ""This is just somewhat common knowledge in the medtech space, in the academic space from a publication standpoint, and that we're reading between the lines here."",
  ""We are cautiously optimistic that this this announcement today, the 40% growth year-over-year, combined with the Category I code, the increased insurance policy coverage, the expanded FDA indication, and then upcoming launch of RED."",
  ""And then, as I mentioned, , Yeah, Ben."",
  ""So, we're cautiously optimistic that we'll have this FDA indication by the end of Q4 and then once we're really close to the FDA indication, we'll tee up manufacturing and we will launch this product very quickly whether that be the end of Q4 or beginning of Q1."",
  ""And then we'll plan what's traditional and from a soft launch standpoint, we'll launch so many accounts the first 30 days, so many accounts the first 60 days and then so many accounts the first 90 days and make sure that everything is as planned and then we'll open this up."",
  ""But as I mentioned earlier, we expect meaningful revenues out of these products in 2025."",
  ""And assuming everything comes through the FDA and the soft launch goes as planned, we've spent about a year-and-a-half on this technology at this point since we began the discussions of licensing it from University of Michigan, and we're confident that the FDA will come through, that we will launch this product and we'll see meaningful revenues in 2025 and cautiously optimistic in the first half of 2025."",
  ""We look forward to a great Q4."",
  ""Talk to you again in the spring."",
  ""Everyone, have a wonderful holiday season and we will talk soon."",
  ""While we wait for some questions, we have some that were sent to us."",
  ""First, can you talk about the significance of receiving the Category I code as well as the 510(K) extension?"",
  ""We have a question for you, Tim."",
  ""On the last call, you spoke expecting G&A expenses to settle in around $2 million a quarter."",
  ""It came in about $2 million in Q3."",
  ""Can we continue to expect this level in the near future?"",
  ""From a cash perspective, the answer to that is yes."",
  ""From a GAAP perspective, we will have some incremental startup costs for RED into 2025."",
  ""And then we also introduced long term employment plan for employees in the fourth quarter of 2024, and that will result in some incremental non-cash expense."",
  ""But our plan as we head into 2025 is to be able to cover those expenses with the revenue growth that we're projecting."",
  ""Short answer from the cash, yes."",
  ""From a GAAP perspective, we will see some increased expenses, but we expect to hold our run rate going into 2025, especially with the revenue growth that we're seeing here in the third quarter that we're expecting in the fourth quarter, and we think that will carry into 2025 to continue to reach our goal of cash flow breakeven in the future once our revenues continue to grow at the pace they're currently are."",
  ""We have one more question here for Brian."",
  ""Can you talk about the time line for the commercialization of RED, and how do you think about the revenues over the next few quarters?""

  ""This focused approach, combined with our operational discipline, positions us for profitable growth in 2025."",
  ""Moving ahead, we're focused on five growth levers, strategic investment into our robust subscription businesses, expansion of our distribution network, continued operational optimization, impactful marketing initiatives, and accelerated innovation that strengthens our growth connection with our consumers."",
  ""This quarter marks a significant milestone as our integrated and shared service platform has achieved profitability through disciplined capital management and operational efficiency."",
  ""Starco now produces and sells and distributes over 50 million units annually of consumer packaged goods through e-commerce and retail channels and impacting millions of households."",
  ""As we scale through 2025, we remain committed to our core mission, delivering innovative behavior-changing products that provide meaningful value for consumers."",
  ""I'm going to now delve into the financials."",
  ""Reported net revenue for third quarter of 2024 was $15.5 million and this is compared to $17.7 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Now, the decrease in net revenue for the third quarter was driven by more targeted e-commerce sales for Soylent due to strategic reductions in inefficient marketing spend, which previously would have resulted in unprofitable sales, as well as lower retail volumes due to Walmart merging and removing an entire set for RTD meal replacement category, which is now being merged into another department."",
  ""The overall decrease was further impacted by lower Whipshots sales due to inventory destocking orders in prior year that has been a challenge throughout 2024."",
  ""This was also partially offset by that increased sales from Winona Popcorn Spray and AOS."",
  ""Now, with that gross profit for the third quarter of 2024 was $6.4 million as compared to $47.7 million for the third quarter of 2023, the decline is a result of lower revenue of unfavorable product mix and lower gross margin of products, which was partially offset by the Soylent segment, which benefited from its price increases."",
  ""We are seeing an increase in gross profit on each brand individually compared to prior year."",
  ""Gross margin for the third quarter of 2024 was down year-over-year, 41% to 44% third quarter of 2023 driven by that mix of lower sales of Whipshots."",
  ""However, gross margin was sequentially from the second quarter was up."",
  ""Our reported unadjusted net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was $6.3 million as compared to the net income of $2.3 million in the third quarter of 2024."",
  ""The increase in reported unadjusted net loss primarily due to the non-cash charge for the fair value share adjustment."",
  ""Marketing, general and administrative expenses for the third quarter of 2024 was $4.2 million or 27% of reported net revenue, as compared to $5 million or 28% of reported net revenues in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Compensation expense for the third quarter of 2024 was $2.2 million, compared to $1.8 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Professional fees for the third quarter of 2024 were $0.4 million, compared to $1.4 million in the same period last year."",
  ""The decrease in operating expenses reflects reduced marketing spend as we prioritize profitability, as well as initial benefits from our shared service, platform integration, operational and logistics efficiency initiatives."",
  ""For the third quarter of 2024, our adjusted EBITDA was $0.7 million compared to $1.1 million in the same period last year."",
  ""The decline was primarily due to a decline in sales for Whipshots, partially offset by lower operating costs."",
  ""Now, I will go into more detail on the first nine months performance for each of our segments, beginning with Starco Brands."",
  ""Starco Brands segment includes Art of Sport, Whipshots and Winona Popcorn Spray."",
  ""The Starco Brands segment's gross revenue for the first nine months of 2024 were $9 million compared to $11.3 million for the same period of 2023."",
  ""The segment's gross profit was $5.6 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $8.8 million for the same period of 2023."",
  ""The decline in gross profit dollars spent in this segment was definitely driven by a mix impact of lower revenue from higher margin Whipshots, offset by the increase in the revenue from Winona."",
  ""Whipshots revenue declined as a result of that inventory stocking orders for the pre-period last year when Winona revenue drastically increased due to distribution adds at Walmart and other retailers and increased velocity on shelf."",
  ""Gross revenue for Skylar segment was $7.2 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $7.4 million for the same period of 2023."",
  ""The segment's gross profit was $4.4 million for the first nine months, compared to $4.3 million for the same period of 2023."",
  ""Gross revenue for Soylent segment was $30.4 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $27.6 million for the same period in 2023."",
  ""Increase was primarily driven by our retail expansion into Kroger, added distribution wins into Walmart, as well as reduced discounts really across all channels."",
  ""The segment's gross profit was $9.1 million for the first nine months of 2024, compared to $7.2 million for the same period of 2023."",
  ""The increase was due to price increases that went into effect second half of fiscal year 2023, lower cost of materials for the first nine months of 2024, and again, cost efficiencies realized through the successful integration of Soylent into the company's shared service platform."",
  ""Now, moving on to our balance sheet."",
  ""As of September 30 of 2024, we had approximately $1.6 million in cash and approximately $13.2 million of inventory on our balance sheet."",
  ""Now, this is in comparison to $1.8 million in cash and $10.7 million of inventory as of December 31, 2023."",
  ""In closing, as we execute on our growth strategy, we've successfully integrated our recent acquisitions into our shared service platform."",
  ""We've also being pushed on creating operational efficiencies across the portfolio."",
  ""This year has been instrumental in understanding opportunities for driving optimal infrastructural improvements, also understanding market dynamics, e-commerce and D2C strategies, and pushing on our retail relationships for both of our acquired and existing brands."",
  ""This provide valuable insights that will inform our targeted expansion into 2025."",
  ""We maintained a balanced approach to capital allocation, prioritizing investments that drive long-term enterprise and shareholder value."",
  ""With a very robust product innovation pipeline and clear visibility into high performing markets and channels, we are well-positioned to finally really accelerate strategic growth and deepen market penetration in the coming year."",
  ""Our portfolio continues to demonstrate strong fundamentals and we're executing with discipline on our expansion initiatives."",
  ""The dedication and agility of our team, combined with our data-driven approach to market expansion, does position us well to capitalize on significant opportunities ahead."",
  ""I really want to  for your time today and your interest in Starco Brands."",
  ""And with that, I'd like to open it up to any questions.""

  ""And welcome to Paragon's 2024 Full Year Results Presentation."",
  ""So we will shortly run through the financial and operational performance and then provide you with our perspective on the outlook, as well as leaving plenty of time for questions."",
  ""But before we get into the detail, let me spend a few minutes looking at the key highlights."",
  ""2024 produced another strong financial and operational performance, and we're absolutely delighted with these results."",
  ""We delivered good outcomes for our customers and shareholders and made excellent progress against our strategic objectives, demonstrating the resilience of our business, as well as the benefits of our increased diversification and the investments we have made in new technology."",
  ""I want to highlight three key areas, our financial performance, our growth and our strong capital position."",
  ""So first our financial position."",
  ""All the guidance metrics we set out at the beginning of the year have been met or exceeded."",
  ""Underlying operating profits increased to nearly £293 million, underlying earnings per share were up by 7.3%."",
  ""And our return on tangible equity is at the top end of the range at 20.3%."",
  ""Fundamentally, this has been achieved through a combination of good loan book growth and resilient margins."",
  ""In addition to a disciplined approach to costs and risk management."",
  ""We had expected margins to plateau in 2024."",
  ""However, we have exceeded the top end of guidance with NIM widening to 316 basis points."",
  ""Despite ongoing investment across our franchise, operating costs have been well-controlled and we have further improved our cost income ratio at 36.1%."",
  ""Our high quality, seasoned loan book demonstrated exceptional resilience and credit performance remains excellent, reflected by an impairment charge of only 16 basis points, some of which will reverse in 2025."",
  ""The second area I want to highlight is the significant progress we have achieved in delivering our customer-focused growth objective."",
  ""Our loan book grew in challenging market conditions, ending up the period 5.6% up at £15.7 billion."",
  ""New lending was strong at £2.7 billion and accelerated as the year progressed, with completions 20% higher in the second half of the year."",
  ""2024 has experienced a notable change in customer sentiment."",
  ""We enter the New Year with good momentum and with new business pipelines up materially on last year."",
  ""Indeed, the buy-to-let pipeline is up 48% and the development finance pipeline has increased by 31%."",
  ""Our savings franchise has seen strong growth, with retail deposits increasing by 23%, enabling us to accelerate TFSME repayments."",
  ""And finally, our excellent capital position."",
  ""Strong internal capital generation is a genuine strength of our business, adding 2.7% to CET1 across the year as are our capital ratios, supporting our growth ambitions and the further buyback of up to £50 million announced today."",
  ""We now have the near-final rules on Basel 3.1 which are significantly less impactful than the previous version."",
  ""But we continue to make good progress with our IRB application for our buy-to-let business."",
  ""We are therefore well-positioned as we head into 2025 ready to support further loan growth and any opportunities that may emerge."",
  ""However, no bank results presentation is complete without reference to motor finance commissions."",
  ""As you can see, we have made no provision because we believe our exposure, if one exists, is modest."",
  ""Nevertheless, we have enhanced our disclosures in the accounts which support this position, and I'll come back to this point later."",
  ""It's clear that 2024's performance is excellent, and this is a reflection of our long-term, disciplined, strategic focus and progress achieved over the last 10 years since the bank's formation in 2014."",
  ""And this can be seen in the following charts."",
  ""Our focus on strong and consistent growth allied with robust financial and operational management is clearly evident."",
  ""And this performance is no accident."",
  ""It reflects our approach in pursuing our strategy with long-term objectives and reducing volatility."",
  ""Loan book growth has been managed carefully."",
  ""We have never chased volume over asset quality or margin."",
  ""This as well as structural changes due to diversification strategy and interest rate normalization have moved margins over the decade from around 2% to 3%."",
  ""Operating profits have increased by 140%, generating significant internal capital, enabling us to support balance sheet growth, complete four acquisitions and return over £1.1 billion to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and buybacks."",
  ""In addition, return on tangible equity and earnings per share have consistently moved up over the period."",
  ""We're very proud of the quality of our book."",
  ""It has withstood a multitude of stresses in recent years, from Brexit to COVID, with our customers facing the sharpest rise in base rates in modern history across a relatively short period."",
  ""An ever changing regulatory landscape, and more recently, a volatile and inflationary economic environment."",
  ""Despite all of this, our impairments have only averaged 10 basis points per annum."",
  ""And over the last 10 years we've written off only £1.5 million of our post-financial crisis buy-to-let loans despite our total lending exceeding £16.2 billion."",
  ""The performance demonstrated by these charts is the result of a long-term commitment to running our business prudently."",
  ""Given the uncertain times in which we live, it demonstrates a track record in mitigating volatility wherever possible and seeking to optimize risk-adjusted returns backed by a high quality loan book through the cycle experience and the deep understanding of the specialist markets in which we operate."",
  ""I'll now hand over to Richard to look at the period performance in detail."",
  ""As Nigel has just outlined, 2024 saw the group's highest operating profit outturn."",
  ""And we've ended the year with strong exit margins, improved pipelines and strong capital, all of which play into the early guidance we've been giving for 2025."",
  ""Starting with the overall income statement, high margins and balances supported a 7.6% growth in net interest income in FY 2024, where margins ended the year rising to 316 basis points and the net loan book grew by 5.6%."",
  ""This is a little above our 10-year average."",
  ""Other income fell following the end of the servicing contract in FY 2023, but should be stable going forward from this level."",
  ""Operating costs include the new banking levy that came in just below £180 million guidance."",
  ""But it's worth noting the improved efficiency we're seeing has taken the cost to income ratio down to 36.1%."",
  ""This is the lowest level we've seen since 2015 when we started our Commercial diversification program with the Five Arrows acquisition, it's now our asset finance business."",
  ""Impairments were elevated in the year, but remained low in H1."",
  ""And in H2, the main increase came from development finance."",
  ""In both divisions, the increases came on variable rate loans with a higher rates environment, house price softness and inflation impacts combined to put small parts of the book under more stress."",
  ""Operating profits were up 5.4% at just under £293 million."",
  ""We saw a smaller fair value movement when compared to FY 2023 being reported pre-tax profits rose 27% in the year."",
  ""Underlying earnings per share rose 7.3% to £1.011."",
  ""This increase was above the increase in underlying profits and reflects the benefits of the 2024 share buyback."",
  ""2024 had seen further growth profit growth in mortgages."",
  ""But Commercial Lending has gone backwards in the year with margins lower – at higher rates."",
  ""However, it should be noted that part of this reflects our allocation basis with the benefit of high rates are seen in our central segment."",
  ""The commercial segment also saw an adverse impact from impairments."",
  ""But as I'll mention in a few slides time, a substantial element of this is expected to reverse in FY 2025."",
  ""Looking in more detail is our net interest margin."",
  ""Our full year outturn of 316 basis points was little above the 3% to 3.1% level we originally guided to and the 3.1% plus that we upgraded to at the interim."",
  ""Asset side new business spreads strengthened as the year progressed, offsetting some of the deposit-led tightening that was anticipated and reflected in our guidance."",
  ""At 314 basis points, our H2 NIM reduced by just 5 basis points from H1 and provides a good entry level to the new financial year."",
  ""It's also worth remembering that Commercial Lending spreads remain significantly wider than buy-to-let, and also the tighter margin legacy buy-to-let book continues to amortize."",
  ""And both of this provides structural support to margins."",
  ""What remains to be seen is quite – how much of an influence quantitative tightening and the broader repayment of TFSME is going to have on the market."",
  ""Our expectations are the base rates fall by about 1% over the next year, and the overall deposit spreads continue to contract taking our full year FY 2025 NIM to 3%."",
  ""As I just mentioned, we expect deposit spreads to continue to tighten."",
  ""We produced this chart at the interim and have strong feedback from it as it gives a useful feel for the deposit spread dynamics at the period end, rather than the average for the period."",
  ""So therefore helps understanding the general positioning of the deposit book."",
  ""The first thing to call out are the rebalancing of the book that took place between variable and fixed rates that took place in FY 2024."",
  ""When compared to the overweight fixed rate focus we had in FY 2023."",
  ""With stronger spreads on variable rates, albeit down on the September 2023 level, this mix change has an important factor in supporting margins over the past year."",
  ""The second feature I'd call out is that we're going from an after-swap benefit to a small post-swap cost from our fixed rate savings between September 2023 and September 2024."",
  ""And we've generally seen stronger competition for fixed rate deposits on variable rates during the year."",
  ""My final point to note on this slide is the material level of pre-placed assets that we have for the Bank of England which give funding flexibility and access to liquidity via short-term repo and ILTR."",
  ""We also have gilts and retained bonds, which support our treasury operations as we seek to optimize the cost and risk aspects of our liquidity."",
  ""Overall, I'd expect a further trend away from fixed rate savings in FY 2025, but for this to be less pronounced than the shift we've seen over the last year."",
  ""Operating expenses came in within guidance and absorbed the new Bank of England levy."",
  ""With a focus on cost efficiency, year-end head count was 7.3% lower than September 2023, with just over 1,400 people."",
  ""And our cost-to-income ratio fell further to 36.1%."",
  ""As we've noted before, despite being several years into our digitalization journey, we've only £8 million worth of capitalized software costs on the balance sheet."",
  ""The bulk of the spend being expensed as incurred."",
  ""I've also highlighted the expected impacts from the National Insurance changes announced in the recent budget."",
  ""This is £1 million in FY 2025 rising to £2 million in FY 2026."",
  ""We've included these high costs in our guidance for FY 2025, which stands at £185 million, which would represent 3.2% inflation."",
  ""Whilst our economic outlook remains cautious, the metrics for FY 2025 are generally a little stronger than we were previously expecting, supported by stronger opening position."",
  ""For largely secured balance sheet property prices continue to be the largest risk driver."",
  ""And you can see from the chart on the right-hand side that the severe scenario, which is based off the Bank of England stress test assumptions, continues to include a very substantial house price decline."",
  ""Now this is the single largest impact and the difference of the impacts when we're comparing the severe scenario to our base case."",
  ""We've softened the scenario weightings little in FY 2025, leaving 5% of the severe weighting back to the base case."",
  ""This continues to exceed the downside weighting we have pre-COVID, but given recent experience, it was hard to justify as conservative stance as we took in FY 2023."",
  ""In terms of the impairments themselves, the net effect of the application of our economic assumptions to our book specifics at September 2024 results in a 1 basis point reduction in the overall coverage ratio from the previous year."",
  ""Judgemental overlays have been maintained at £6.5 million."",
  ""As noted earlier, the provision charge for the year has been a little bit more elevated than normal on our variable rate portfolios, notably buy-to-let and development finance, with the latter having a bigger impact over time as facilities face higher cost than we originally envisaged."",
  ""That's both in build and interest rate terms."",
  ""Developments were underwritten when rates were already elevated and performing in line with expectations."",
  ""A feature of IFRS 9 is the need to discount future cash flows at the EIR to arrive at expected credit losses."",
  ""This discounting is particularly important for development finance, which carries the highest rates on our balance sheet to reflect the high capital requirements for those loans."",
  ""The loans also only repay once the development is complete rather I've included our normal capital bridge chart on the next slide."",
  ""Underlying retained earnings demonstrate our ongoing core capital generation."",
  ""This is the 2.7% of CET1 that Nigel mentioned earlier."",
  ""The notable year-on-year changes were around a 0.5% benefit from lower fair value charges and an equal and opposite additional 0.5% used to support the balance sheet growth with a higher risk-weighted commercial portfolio grew by 16.1% in the year."",
  ""The impacts from share buybacks and dividends were similar to 2023's levels, and we ended the year with a 14.2% CET1 and a total capital ratio of 16%."",
  ""This translate to more than £200 million surplus to our regulatory requirements."",
  ""On group capital, the key metrics behind the capital levels at September are included in the table on the right-hand side of the slide."",
  ""It's worth noting that the decrease in – sorry, the increase in the Commercial division scale in the year has driven the increase in the portfolio risk weight to 45.6% from 44.3% a year earlier."",
  ""We ended up not completing the second half of the buyback in FY 2024."",
  ""But the rate cap figures here reflect the full buyback given the 30 of September irrevocable that we made."",
  ""And the consequence of the first £7.5 million of our FY 2025 buyback is free from a rate cap perspective if you start with these numbers."",
  ""We've now started to see the PRA approving larger institutions hybrid IRB models."",
  ""And as a consequence, we're getting much more definitive feedback on our approach."",
  ""We continue to adapt our modeling to fit the PRA's emerging requirements and achieving an IRB accreditation remains our objective."",
  ""Timing as ever depends on the PRA's feedback and the process requirements for the consequent model enhancement that we need to make."",
  ""As soon as we have anything tangible to say, we'll update the markets."",
  ""Also on capital, the near-final rules on Basel 3.1 were not as painless as we originally thought with our September 2024 impact assessment of 104 basis points of CET1, comparing favorably to the estimated impact of 2.1% from the original CP."",
  ""However, we're not counting our chickens yet."",
  ""Given consultations relating to Pillar 2 expected to conclude in FY 2025, which may mitigate some of this benefit depending on where they eventually land."",
  ""One of the positive developments, though, from the Basel 3.1 announcement was the establishment of the Interim Capital Regime."",
  ""This effectively adds a year for firms to get ready for Basel 3.1, making the effective date the 1 of January 2027."",
  ""This is important for us as it gives us a longer runway for the IRB process to play out, and we expect to apply for this option as soon as the PRA release the required documentation."",
  ""As regards to capital management, we've completed £92.5 million of the £100 million FY 2024 buyback."",
  ""And in addition to announcing a new buyback of up to £50 million for the year, we're going to finish the FY 2024 program as well."",
  ""With underlying EPS of over £1.00 per share of 2024 Full year dividend stands at £0.404, an increase of 8% from its 2023 level."",
  ""Our policy for FY 2025 is unchanged and we expect to distribute around 40% of underlying earnings for the year."",
  ""Since 2015, when we updated our dividend policy and started the buybacks, we've distributed over £1.1 billion to shareholders by the time these distributions are made."",
  ""At the same time, we've grown the loan book by almost 60% and underlying profits by around 120%."",
  ""For my final slide I wanted to say a bit about our return on tangible equity measure."",
  ""For our return analysis, we look at underlying earnings and our tangible equity."",
  ""To get to underlying earnings, movements in intangibles and the income statement are excluded, and the value of intangibles in the balance sheet are also excluded."",
  ""Our previous alternative performance measure did the same for fair values, removing the element of the fair value movement that goes through P&L and also removing the balance sheet fair value items in the denominator."",
  ""The wider market does most of this, but excludes the balance sheet leg of the fair value adjustment."",
  ""This gives a more conservative outcome when fair values are positive, as they are today, but a more optimistic one when fair values move the other way."",
  ""As you can see from the chart, the alternative approach would take the FY 2023 reported level to 17.3% and FY 2024 to 17.2%."",
  ""Our plan is the base guidance and underlying reporting on this more comparative basis going forward."",
  ""Importantly, though, we retain our 15% to 20% management target for this new rating measure."",
  ""I will now hand you back to Nigel."",
  ""So let me turn our attention to how the business had progressed against our strategic priorities and provide you with our view on the outlook for the period ahead."",
  ""We've shared with you previously how we focus on these five key priorities and how they are interconnected and supported by our structural pillars of our strong customer-focused culture, our passionate and committed people who hold such incredible values."",
  ""And our excellent financial foundations with a high quality customer base, strong capital and significant liquidity."",
  ""So turning now to how we have performed against these individual strategic priorities across the year."",
  ""So starting with growth, as I highlighted earlier, we outperformed the market this year and delivered a strong loan book growth of 5.6% in line with long-term trends."",
  ""While our savings business grew by nearly a quarter."",
  ""Moving on to diversification, where this element of the strategy helps reduce volatility and exposure to individual sectors, as well as broadening our income sources and diluting our fixed costs."",
  ""The evolution of our business is clear to see."",
  ""Paragon is no longer a pure-play buy-to-let operator."",
  ""Our Commercial Lending operations make a greater contribution to our performance each year, with the division accounting for 45% of new lending during the period growing at 4 times the rate of buy-to-let and now accounting for 27% of group income."",
  ""With Commercial Lending generating a stronger margin than mortgages, This mix effect has been an important factor in the continued strong NIM performance for the year."",
  ""Our multiyear technology investment program is delivering excellent results for the group with exciting developments in the pipeline."",
  ""Our front-end technology transformation program has significantly enhanced our capabilities in buy-to-let, SME lending and development finance leading to an improved customer experience, expanded operational capacity and increased cost efficiencies."",
  ""We have increasingly applied cloud-based technology utilizing an extensive API connectivity, accessing multiple data sources and building partnerships, and continuing the next level of our vision to be a leading technology-enabled specialist bank."",
  ""Our new mortgage originations platform built bespoke to our needs, will be live in the New Year and we are developing further exciting opportunities in our savings franchise."",
  ""And we are also examining how AI can benefit the business, streamlining tasks and driving productivity."",
  ""We already have AI-embedded across many areas of our operation and we are running a further series of pilots across the group."",
  ""With the front-end transformation largely complete, we are moving our focus to our back-end systems, which will improve our efficiency even further."",
  ""Now turning to capital management."",
  ""Internal capital generation has continued to be strong, with the group delivering a 2.7% accretion to CET1."",
  ""This is a powerful and sustainable strength of the group and provides the ability to support growth and enhance returns to shareholders."",
  ""Finally, we remain committed to doing the right thing as part of our sustainability strategy and we're on course to achieve operational net zero by 2030."",
  ""Since 2019, we have improved our operational emissions, reducing them by 48%."",
  ""Our financed emissions, however, are based on our customers' assets and this present a greater challenge to reduce, although we are making progress here."",
  ""In buy-to-let, we're pleased that the EPC rating on the loan book improved month on month and we expect further improvements in the coming years."",
  ""We have seen a positive response to our Green Homes Initiative in our development finance business, increasing the fund from £200 million to £300 million this year."",
  ""Additionally, we recently announced an expansion of the range of green assets we can fund in our SME lending business."",
  ""So much of our financed emissions are in the hands of our customers and much will depend on the Government's framework in dealing with this issue."",
  ""And in this context, we await the Government's consultation on introducing minimum energy efficiency standards for rental property, with legislation likely to present opportunities and no doubt some challenges for the sector."",
  ""So now let's turn to the performance of each of the business lines, starting with buy-to-let."",
  ""The buy-to-let loan book continue to grow during the year, up 4.4% to £13.3 billion, mainly due to our strong retentions program and the recovery in new lending activity as the year progressed."",
  ""As expected, new lending volumes were lower during the period, primarily due to a weaker housing market, as the sector adapted to the higher rate environment, which affected completions during the first half of the financial year."",
  ""However, buy-to-let completions accelerated during the second half of the year."",
  ""They were up 30% on the first half as the market showed signs of recovery."",
  ""We have carried that momentum into the New Year with improving sentiment, particularly amongst professional landlords who have benefited from strong yield performance and record levels of tenant demand across most areas of the UK."",
  ""Our buy-to-let pipeline has increased by 48% to £881 million, providing an encouraging start to the new financial year, helping us to upgrade guidance for 2025 compared to the £1.5 billion delivered in 2024."",
  ""Our retention's performance remains exceptional with our overall redemption rate falling and more than 80% of our customers with maturing fixed rate mortgages going on to take a new product."",
  ""The profile of the loan book continues to evolve with redemptions significantly higher amongst legacy customers."",
  ""The new book consists predominantly of professional landlords and grew by 9.7%, accounting for an increased proportion of the portfolio."",
  ""Demand for rented property is expected to exceed supply for many years to come, with the latest data from Zoopla showing over 20 inquiries for every available rental property, double the pre-pandemic levels."",
  ""Demographic trends such as a rise in single person households, the inadequate supply of alternative social housing and the expected 10% population increase by 2036, much of which is expected to be by way of immigration."",
  ""Well they all combine to create sustained demand for our customers' properties."",
  ""The new government has launched a revised version of the Renters Rights Bill and we've been working with them to ensure its various changes are implemented in a sensible manner to avoid unintended consequences."",
  ""The budget somewhat pleasingly did not increase CGT on buy-to-let properties but did raise stamp-duty surcharge on second homes to 5%."",
  ""Whilst financially unhelpful, professional landlords have managed their way through previous increases in this tax rate and will do so again."",
  ""We anticipated that buy-to-let volumes would be weaker in 2024, but confidence has changed."",
  ""The pipeline is now stronger and we expect our 2025 mortgage lending to be comfortably above that of 2024 with our 2025 guidance of between £1.6 billion and £1.8 billion."",
  ""The asset quality of our buy-to-let book remains excellent and arrears are significantly lower than the broader market."",
  ""The average loan to value on the portfolio stands at 62.8%, only 2.6% of the book has an LTV of greater than 80%."",
  ""As you saw earlier, actual write-offs are negligible, which reflects our focus on prudent underwriting, extensive use of data analytics and the highly experienced portfolio and property management teams."",
  ""As said at the half year presentation, mortgage arrears have fallen declining from 68 basis points at the end of March to 38 basis points at the year-end, reflecting the improving environment."",
  ""Despite this, affordability continues to be managed closely."",
  ""We have always operated conservative stress testing in this area and applied it rigorously throughout, including employing tests over and above regulatory requirements."",
  ""It's clear that although debt service costs are higher, rents have kept pace, leaving the current debt service ratio, the ICR in the pipeline standing at over 200%."",
  ""So now let's turn to the Commercial Lending business lines."",
  ""The contribution of Commercial Lending continues to grow."",
  ""The division is integral to our diversification strategy and a core driver of our structural NIM expansion delivering NIM of 5.9% in the period."",
  ""As I mentioned earlier, Commercial Lending accounted for 45% of new business volumes during the period, whilst contributing 27% of income."",
  ""Similar to buy-to-let, we are upgrading our new lending guidance for 2025 to between £1.2 billion and £1.4 billion."",
  ""Good opportunities exist across the Commercial division and we expect to see further growth over time across the markets in which we operate."",
  ""So turning to each division in turn."",
  ""Development finance is a cyclical business with recent performance being driven by the interest rate environment and broader trends in the housing market."",
  ""The housing sector has been exposed to significant volatility in recent years, with rapidly increasing mortgage rates impacting buyer's ability and appetite to purchase new homes."",
  ""Therefore, we previously anticipated that our development finance division would see weaker growth across new activity due to these factors, as well as issues more specific to the sector, including supply chain disruption, cost growth and planning constraints."",
  ""Despite this, the division recorded loan book growth of 18% year-on-year as existing facilities continue to roll out their build programs supporting robust cash draw-ins."",
  ""The portfolio has been resilient in credit terms similar to mortgages."",
  ""The sharp increase in interest rates impacted certain customers, which required careful management from time to time."",
  ""But our cautious underwriting, good LTVs and a highly experienced team saw the portfolio performing well and with high degrees of resilience."",
  ""There's also been a notable increase in confidence over the year, with a significant step-up in inquiry levels and the pipeline now 31% above September 2023 levels."",
  ""We have also – we also have the potential for a change in planning rules supporting the new government's plan to increase housebuilding."",
  ""So now moving on to our SME lending."",
  ""SME loan demand in recent years has been sluggish due to the unwinding effects of COVID and the weaker economy."",
  ""However, our SME division was able to take market share witnessed a new lending growth of 7.3% and supporting loan book growth of nearly 8% to over £815 million."",
  ""The benefit of our technology investment continues to be seen with 69% of new business submitted going through our broker portals."",
  ""Using AI, which assesses over 4,000 pieces of customer data with each application, we can make lending decisions faster and more effectively, delivering better customer outcomes."",
  ""Further technology developments are in the pipeline, including greater use of streamlined decision making to deliver funds to customer accounts more quickly, and the re-platforming of the back office to strengthen the division's foundations to facilitate further growth."",
  ""Credit performance remained strong, with nearly 90% of the book secured."",
  ""And the portfolio is performing incredibly well, with no indications of credit deterioration or concerns from the early warning indicators."",
  ""Our market share in this sector is still low and opportunities exist to grow the division even further over years to come."",
  ""With an ongoing technology investment program and an experienced management team, the division is well placed to achieve this objective."",
  ""So turning now to the remaining areas of the Commercial division."",
  ""Although motor finance business flows were softer compared to last year, the loan book growth was still strong, up 11.4% year-on-year, with growth being particularly evident in the leisure vehicle market."",
  ""The portfolio is resilient and as with SME, we are seeing a robust credit performance."",
  ""Clearly the motor finance industry has recently been focused on the FCA investigation into commission structures and the more recent Court of Appeal decision."",
  ""We only started lending in this area in 2014 and we've built a high quality book that looks very different from the recent Court of Appeal cases."",
  ""Our customers are prime borrowers with a different level of sophistication compared to the profile of the appeal cases."",
  ""And also with a significant focus on leisure vehicles."",
  ""The portfolio has low arrears and has experienced low complaint levels."",
  ""Furthermore, as you will see from the enhanced conduct note, the vast majority of our business has been originated by brokers, not car dealers."",
  ""Our aggregate commission payments to dealers since 2014 is only £9 million, with just under £40 million having been paid to brokers and the commission rate has averaged only 3.8%."",
  ""This is not an exposure estimate."",
  ""It is the total we have paid to motor finance intermediaries."",
  ""As mentioned, we have not taken a provision, but we have set out enhanced disclosures in the accounts."",
  ""And I suggest if you want to discuss this in more detail then please reach out to Richard separately."",
  ""Finally, structured lending, which provides asset-backed lending to non-bank specialist firms, has had a strong period of activity, with a 52% increase in the loan book to £257 million alongside good customer retention."",
  ""Its new business pipeline is strong and we anticipate healthy growth in 2025."",
  ""As seen elsewhere, the credit performance here is exemplary."",
  ""Our Commercial Lending division is generally regarded as more cyclical in nature than mortgages and has performed particularly, resiliently in this more challenging economic environment."",
  ""With a NIM approaching 6%, 3 times that of mortgages, it provides the group with a strong risk-adjusted return and a structural NIM benefit."",
  ""As I referenced earlier, our award-winning deposit franchise grew strongly finishing the year with balances of £16.3 billion."",
  ""We are proud to be one of the fastest growing savings franchises in the UK, developing a diversified and flexible proposition."",
  ""The higher rate environment has no doubt driven deposit growth across the market and we have continued to provide good pass-through rates to our customers."",
  ""Finally, our strong ISA product range has been highly successful as savers have increasingly turned their attention to the attractive returns available."",
  ""Although portfolio rates appear to have peaked, retention levels are high and customer feedback remain strong."",
  ""The growth in our savings business has been incredibly strong over a number of years."",
  ""Two years ago, the balances stood at only £11 billion."",
  ""This growth has been supported – supported the expansion of the loan book and the repayment of wholesale funding, including old securitizations and £2 billion of our TFSME repayments."",
  ""This requirement is now virtually complete and our need to raise new deposit growth will reduce significantly going forward, which will help in margin management."",
  ""Nevertheless, we expect some liability margin contraction in 2025 and this is already built into our guidance."",
  ""Despite this, we will still focus on expanding our customer reach as we continue to develop our savings franchise."",
  ""With over £650 billion in current and savings accounts earning below market rates, significant opportunities exist to broaden our customer reach."",
  ""Advancements in technology have contributed significantly to the growth of our savings division."",
  ""And we are actively exploring our new innovative opportunities to expand our product range and enhance our offerings."",
  ""We're also widening our wholesale funding options where the group has a long history in the securitization markets."",
  ""We are working on a covered bond program, which has the potential to support wholesale issuance at pricing comfortably inside mortgage-backed securities."",
  ""Alongside this, we are delighted to announce the confirmation of a second credit rating, this time from Moody's, alongside the existing rating from Fitch."",
  ""Additionally, we have set up a number of market repo lines, which will continue to diversify funding and utilize our extensive contingent collateral capacity."",
  ""We have a strong savings franchise and have built and continue to build optionality in our funding model, enabling us to support growth and optimize margins."",
  ""So in conclusion, we have delivered an outstanding financial and operational performance in 2024 aligned to our strategic objectives with the outturn ahead of expectations we laid out at the beginning of the year."",
  ""Underlying profits have reached a new record."",
  ""We have delivered an outstanding return on tangible equity and NIM performance."",
  ""And we have managed to grow the loan book well in challenging market conditions, supporting our customers and helping them to achieve their ambitions."",
  ""The asset performance of the book is excellent and the headwinds that led to an increase in arrears across some elements of the portfolio appears to have passed."",
  ""Customer confidence in our property-related markets has recovered following the volatility of 2023, reflecting an improved new lending pipelines."",
  ""And we enter 2025 with good momentum."",
  ""We continue to diversify our business, spreading the sources of income and defraying the fixed cost structures that inevitably exist in a highly regulated sector."",
  ""We are also continuing to diversify our funding sources, all of which will give better opportunities in margin management."",
  ""And we now have some clarity on the future regulatory environment and the near final and more favorable Basel 3.1 rules."",
  ""Nevertheless, despite the benefits, we are progressing with our plans to move to the IRB approach."",
  ""It is clear, we've been able to consistently generate robust levels of internal capital, which has supported strong loan growth and a program that has seen capital repatriated to shareholders of over £1.1 billion."",
  ""We expect to continue generating strong levels of capital in the future, which will be implied in supporting organic growth as well as providing us with the ability to participate in the long awaited consolidation in the banking sector."",
  ""And, of course, maintaining our long established commitment to capital management, employing it most effectively for the benefit of shareholders."",
  ""Our business is in great shape."",
  ""We have a high quality customer base and a strong balance sheet, and we stand ready to react to the opportunities and challenges as and when they arise."",
  ""And we're now ready to take your questions.""
]","[
  ""This is Gary Greenwood at Shore Capital."",
  ""And I've got three hopefully quick questions."",
  ""So first was just around the budget."",
  ""You mentioned the increase to stamp-duty."",
  ""I was just wondering if there were any other observations around customer behavior either before the budget or since?"",
  ""Second one was around capital."",
  ""So I note the additional Moody's rating that you've got."",
  ""I think your Tier-2 bond matures in 2026."",
  ""I was just wondering if you've got any plans to add any AT1 to the capital stack to make it more efficient?"",
  ""And then lastly, just on deposit growth, I think you sort of said that the TFSME refinancing is broadly done now."",
  ""So should we be thinking of deposit growth more in line with loan book growth now?"",
  ""I have three questions, please."",
  ""First, if you could talk about the pricing trends in buy-to-let and your expectations on spreads in that business in the context of the rate view?"",
  ""Secondly, on deposits, you expect spreads to tend towards zero, so over what period, is that partly due to the lagged effect of repricing, but – or also on the new flow?"",
  ""And then what are the upside and downside risk to that view?"",
  ""And finally, if you could tie that together for margin development from 2025 into 2026, please?"",
  ""I've got three questions as well, please."",
  ""You mentioned, Nigel taking market share in SME lending."",
  ""And if you can just remind us who you're taking share from, that would be helpful?"",
  ""Similarly in buy-to-let you've talked about the pick-up in new lending in the second half and the outlook for FY 2025."",
  ""Just keen to understand whether this is largely market driven or you're taking share in the buy-to-let market as well and from whom?"",
  ""And lastly, to the point about increasing professionalization, just interested to know what the number of average properties a landlord on your books has now versus five years ago?"",
  ""So I'm Stuart Duncan from Peel Hunt."",
  ""I've got two questions, if that's okay."",
  ""First of all, on redemption leverage, you say it's about remortgage activity and what impact that would have?"",
  ""Just where you'd expect redemption levels to trend back towards?"",
  ""And then secondly, I think you made sort of pricing commentThe usual process."",
  ""You have to press the button on the microphone."",
  ""And, of course, name and number, Gary."",
  ""So I'd say no – nothing of any particular note in terms of customer behavior around the budget."",
  ""There wasn't a sudden rush of people trying to kind of buy their properties ahead of the stamp-duty changes or selling them."",
  ""There's lots in the press about everyone selling their properties."",
  ""We have to say, we didn't notice it, particularly in being -particularly evident in our portfolio."",
  ""In terms of – on the capital, no plans – no immediate plans for AT1 as an option."",
  ""We get regularly courted by the investment banks to issue one, but we'll issue one when we're ready on that front."",
  ""I mean, if you look, our deposit growth has been exceptional, 23% this year, 25% the year before, going from £0 to £16 billion in 10 years."",
  ""And if you think we were financing a growing business and refinancing the old securitizations and any wholesale funding."",
  ""So we've had to run a lot harder than the market every year."",
  ""We've taken lots of market share on that."",
  ""Now, we kind of – we're mature."",
  ""We were more – our demands on the market are far less than they have been in the past, which actually is a great position because you imagine being in the market and you kind of have to take more and more and more money from the market, you have to pay up for it."",
  ""So this will give us – I made reference in the few words I said about margin management."",
  ""And I think it gives us better price management in the – for the flow of new business as and when it comes through."",
  ""I'll do the buy-to-let one."",
  ""You do the... Difficult ones."",
  ""So if you typically look the margin – the asset margin is about 2% on buy-to-let."",
  ""And I'd say that margin during the course of 2024 strengthened."",
  ""It was a little bit lower earlier in the year and it was kind of like – not this kind of the 2%, maybe even slightly above it towards the end of the year, from month to month, it does move around a bit."",
  ""But our aim would be to consistently try and deliver 2% asset spread."",
  ""What you tend to see, which I'm sure you've seen it, in banking generally, there's a kind of a trade-off between asset spreads and liability spreads."",
  ""When rates go up, you make more money on your liabilities, less on your assets."",
  ""Just in the pure spread sense, when rates come down you kind of – it kind of switches."",
  ""So overall, we're looking at that 3% margin is where we want to get to."",
  ""In one sense, you don't really mind where it comes from."",
  ""In terms of deposits, our planning view is that once we hit base rates they're sort of resting level probably in the low 3s, at that point, you'd be pretty much neutral in terms of your deposit margin."",
  ""So given that we're looking at a percent of base rates next year, we're probably looking about the same in 2026."",
  ""So a similar, if you like, squeeze on the deposit spread in 2026 compared to 2025."",
  ""So I hope that gives a bit of a steer in terms of the thinking then generally in terms of that post 2025 piece."",
  ""I think the – as well as the deposits though clearly the asset spreads are important."",
  ""As Nigel mentioned, the – we're looking at around a 2% spread on buy-to-let that strengthened a little bit during FY 2024."",
  ""As rates fall further you expect probably to get a little bit more on – from that side as well, but not a huge amount."",
  ""But also I think the – for our higher yielding commercial businesses that was always the strongest margin business in the group, if you like pre the rate increases, we didn't pass the whole 5% on to those customers."",
  ""You would expect to take a little bit more margin back as rates drop, but not a huge amount."",
  ""So I think that helps support that position probably to something a little bit more balanced in 2025 compared to – sorry 2026 compared to 2025."",
  ""So broadly, we haven't got to the point that we're giving 2026 guidance, but I wouldn't expect it to be materially different to 2025."",
  ""So the SME market share."",
  ""So I think the dynamics that's happened for the SME market."",
  ""Actually lending volumes the kind of non-government-backed schemes, so the COVID schemes, the stock of lending is still low than it was in 2019."",
  ""So there's still a kind of a recovery phase of shifting it back to the private sector, as it were – or non-government-backed sector still underway."",
  ""So you do get kind of like things distort from time-to-time."",
  ""Our market share is not coming from the bigger players in that market, but kind of the Lombards and which is NatWest, the Lloyds and the HSBCs and the like."",
  ""So it's very much the people we compete with are going to be the specialist banks."",
  ""And there's also quite a lot of non-banks in the asset finance markets as well."",
  ""So that's kind of our key competitive set and that's where kind of grabbed a bit of market share from."",
  ""In the buy-to-let side, in terms of the way that market shares have gone there, we seem – some of the players have been quite active like Nationwide or TMW have been probably more active in the last year in buy-to-let."",
  ""But where we've done and taken our growth from I think it still remains in the core markets in which we operate."",
  ""And the people, the competitive set that we see is probably the ones you know is the OSBs, the Aldermores of this world."",
  ""So it's the areas that we focus on is very much 99% of what we do is through a professional landlord or complex property."",
  ""So it's that same competitive set that we've always had on there."",
  ""The professionalization of the buy-to-let market, I think is an interesting thing more generally because you hear a lot in the press about the kind of the build to rent, which is kind of synonymous – or deemed synonymous with the professionalization of the sector."",
  ""But what we tend to see there is those are kind of bespoke properties with particular sets of requirements, which is – and we do some of that through our development finance area where we build and obviously sell."",
  ""But we don't tend to get involved in that there on the – on our professional buy-to-let side."",
  ""But the typical number of properties per landlord is about 14 and has it changed much?"",
  ""Probably within the professional community hasn't changed that much."",
  ""We've just been doing more professional."",
  ""So the kind of average number per customer – our overall customer base has probably changed across that period."",
  ""So, yeah, there's a subset of our development finance book where the underwriting and So a small number of those have had challenges and we keep tight tabs on the rest of the portfolio."",
  ""At the moment, we would have said that actually the position is quite stable."",
  ""So you wouldn't expect the same rate of increase, certainly in terms of where we're seeing things at the moment."",
  ""I think the rate outlook is going to be quite important there."",
  ""If we do see rates continuing to moderate 5% over the next year, that has a big benefit on the affordability of variable rate loans."",
  ""So you wouldn't expect a repeat of that performance."",
  ""If you look at first half and second half, the first half on buy-to-let had seen a similar profile."",
  ""So at September last year our three months plus arrears were 34 basis points."",
  ""By March, they doubled to 68."",
  ""But over time, by September, those have come back to 38 basis points."",
  ""So I think the – certainly for the buy-to-let business, there's been more time for landlords to pass rent increases on."",
  ""And you have actually started to see rates come down on those variable rate loans."",
  ""So we'd expect the same to come through on development finance."",
  ""I think the – if you have to split our book at the two very different dynamics going on with the portfolio."",
  ""So the redemptions in the legacy book tend to be higher."",
  ""They are older, more seasoned."",
  ""The last loan there got written in what, 2007, 2008."",
  ""So you can see there's a natural lifecycle to some of those are getting close to their kind of final maturity."",
  ""So there's one factor related to that."",
  ""Separately, you've also got just the dynamic of market activity."",
  ""When the market is buoyant, the market is growing, you'll naturally get more redemptions."",
  ""And clearly, we've had a couple of years where that's been weak on that side."",
  ""But what we would expect to see is almost like an equal and opposite effect, in the redemptions on the book of the stock could go up, but you would probably outperform on the new lending side as well."",
  ""So there is a definite correlation between those two, both positively and negatively."",
  ""So we think the kind of the net loan book, which is ultimately the only thing that matters unless obviously you're replacing different margins on the way through, is probably neutral against those dynamics on that."",
  ""The other one, the consolidation, I mean, this is kind of like the thing that keeps getting talked about for quite a while."",
  ""I think there's a lot of banks in the UK that do a lot of similar things."",
  ""And there's probably a need for a bit of consolidation."",
  ""The trigger points to that is inevitably willing buyer, willing seller at the right price."",
  ""Sometimes those things stay apart for too long."",
  ""Equally, you've got a bit of a cloud at the moment going on with regulatory change."",
  ""You've had Basel 3.1, which is kind of like the mist is clearing on that one at least."",
  ""But you've also now got the conduct issues on the motor finance side, and that has – it causes people to pause for thought on that one."",
  ""So I think it will happen."",
  ""But I've said that before."",
  ""And it probably – well it happened in certain parts."",
  ""The challenger community have seen a lot in the last year with the kind of the Virgins and the co-ops and the like."",
  ""But the kind of the specialist arena, I still expect it to happen, but it just hasn't happened yet."",
  ""And of course, we remain an interested party there."",
  ""Is there any more questions in the room?"",
  ""Just need to check for the – any calls coming in via the... You got the call?"",
  ""Well, in terms of the consolidation, I hope I answered that question."",
  ""But if Ben wants to reach out and have another chat about it, tell him to just get in touch."",
  ""I mean there's a good disclosure on motor finance commissions in the Accounts Section 28 or Note 28."",
  ""And what we set out there is a clear position of the maximum commissions we've paid to the dealers."",
  ""We set it out in total and we set it out individually, whether it's by a dealer or whether it's by a broker."",
  ""The reason for setting that out and the point, which Ben has kind of raised there is if you look at the Court of Appeal cases that came out – those were all three of them were focused on car dealers."",
  ""And the issue relates to the fact is that if you go in and buy a car, the kind of the communications piece or the judgment handed down was highlighted in the fact that the profits were expected to be made by the car dealer from the sale of a car not from commission."",
  ""And clearly, when you have a broker, there is no other income."",
  ""It's just an expectation of they do some work on behalf of a customer to get them a piece of finance."",
  ""So there is definitely a different fact pattern that was definitely set out quite clearly by the court appeal."",
  ""We'll see in terms of what that means, in terms of the way – as and when it gets to the Supreme Court – if it gets to the Supreme Court."",
  ""But nevertheless, even if there's no differentiation between car dealers and motor finance brokers, the total that we're talking about is £49 million of commission, which I repeat is not necessarily the liability."",
  ""I think that's – we've never had a difficulty in getting good underwriters or good people."",
  ""But I said therefore I don't think the dynamics of whether a consolidation has happened nor the difficulties that may be being experienced by some in the motor finance space."",
  ""So I'd say it's not really been a particular point that we see as important at this stage."",
  ""Is that all from the phones?"",
  ""Unless any there's last minute questions, I'll draw proceedings to a close."",
  ""Richard is available to talk to you today and tomorrow."",
  ""So if you want to have some already asked for calls, if you want to have a call with Richard, please do so."",
  ""Get in touch with him."",
  ""And of course, we'll be around for a little while to come."",
  ""So happy to carry on chatting if any of you want to talk."",
  "" very much once again."",
  ""And we'll see you in six months' time.""

  ""The start of the financial year has been very successful and the leadership in the core platforms remained as strong as ever."",
  ""The number of customers and inventory saw healthy growth in each of our core verticals and both B2C ARPU and C2C yields have increased double-digits."",
  ""This has resulted in a strong financial performance with revenue growth over 17% and EBITDA up 18%."",
  ""In fact, I'm very proud that our EBITDA for this half of the year is almost equal to our full year EBITDA three year IPO."",
  ""Which is a remarkable achievement in just 3.5 years period."",
  ""In addition, we have expanded our industry leading EBITDA margin to 79% and maintained cash conversion close to 100%."",
  ""We continue to implement our capital policy."",
  ""In July, we participated in the last Apex Placement and bought shares for over €13 million."",
  ""We paid down €5 million debt in May and €7 million in November."",
  ""And the board has proposed an interim dividend of €1.2 per share to be paid in January."",
  ""Our platforms are one of the most dominant platforms in the world."",
  ""The total portfolio is visited 9 times per month by each citizen in the region."",
  ""All three vertical business lines have excelled, achieving the record number of advertisers and increased ARPU in B2C and yields in C2C. What is very important that our core revenue streams B2C and C2C have achieved remarkable growth with both segments reporting a 17% increase."",
  ""In spring, we successfully implemented pricing and packaging changes for our C2C segments, which have resulted in double-digit yields growth across all business units."",
  ""At the same time, the inventory levels remained at record high."",
  ""The changes to our B2C prices and packages in autumn last and this year at the same time led to increased ARPU in all business lines."",
  ""Automotive 17%, real estate 19% up and 12% growth in jobs, while the number of business customers were robust across all business lines."",
  ""Our strategic pricing and packaging events launched in the first half of the year."",
  ""So I think that's up with a great momentum for the second half of the year."",
  ""Now I will hand over to Lina to talk about the financials."",
  ""The underlying markets we operate in, are in the recovery with improving macroeconomic environment, driving demand in the autos, real estate and labor markets."",
  ""The inflation has slowed down and the region returned to real wage growth, with increasing customers – consumers purchasing power."",
  ""In addition, it's important to remember that the Baltics has been the fastest growing region in the European Union over the last few decades."",
  ""This is largely attributed to high expert growth, vibrant employment market and the strong credit profiles, both public and private."",
  ""This environment has created a great opportunities for our customers, as well as our company, to take advantage of the growth and generate profits."",
  ""Looking forward, the board remains confident in the outlook for the second half of the year, driven by the successful implementation of pricing and packaging changes and continued momentum across our businesses."",
  ""For the second half of the year, the board is expecting the revenue growth of at least 15%."",
  ""With autos, real estate and jobs service segment projected to grow above this target, while the generalist category, is expected to grow below the overall group average."",
  ""Growth will primarily be fueled by B2C ARPU and C2C yield expansion, with inventory levels anticipated to remain in line with those observed in H1."",
  ""This implies an upgrade to full year revenue outlook after the over performance in H1."",
  ""The board expects EBITDA margin for the financial year 2025 to expand by 1 percentage point compared to last year."",
  ""In terms of capital allocation, the board remains committed to its current policy, prioritizing the use of excess cash to both reduce the gross debt and continue a share buyback program, particularly in the absence of compelling M&A opportunities."",
  ""Now it's a time for Q&A.Hello everyone."",
  ""During the first half of the year, we observed sustained momentum in our core business, which remains well-positioned for growth throughout the remainder of the year."",

  ""Listing fees, B2C and C2C, which represent our core revenue stream, account for 90% of total revenue."",

  ""The jobs and services business line grew by 17%, within this line jobs represents the B2C segment and grew 14%."",
  ""And services, which is the majority of the business line C2C and it accounts for 18% of the business line, revenue grew 28%."",
  ""The smallest business line generalist grew 4%."",
  ""If overall revenue growth has been driven by a growing base of advertisers and ads, as well as yield improvements across both B2C and C2C segments."",
  ""Regarding yield improvements, as Justinas already touched, we have continued with our regular schedule of pricing events."",
  ""At the start of the half year."",
  ""We implemented C2C pricing changes across most of our platforms, which gave impact to the entire half year."",
  ""And in September and October 2024, we introduced B2C pricing and packaging changes for auto, real estate and jobs platforms reflecting enhancements to our value proposition."",
  ""These changes will contribute more to the second half of the year."",
  ""And in the jobs business line, due to 12 months duration of most contracts."",
  ""The impact of these changes will flow through gradually over the course of the year."",
  ""We continue to observe strengthening network effects across all business units."",
  ""Here's the performance of our business lines over the recent financial half year and as shown, each business line remains on a consistent growth trajectory."",
  ""Notably, group revenue for the H1 has doubled since our IPO compared to H1 2021."",

  ""People costs account for 15% of revenue, programming development and system administration, all handed internally with – these expenses reflected in salaries."",

  ""Paid search traffic remains minimal, keeping the total marketing costs at slightly more than 1% of group revenue."",
  ""As a portfolio of brands, we optimize marketing expenses by leveraging our own websites for advertising, minimizing reliance on external service providers."",
  ""And this approach is particularly effective due to our ownership of Skelbiu, ranked as the sixth most visited site in Lithuania and featuring strong vertical categories."",

  ""Following the half year-end, additional €7 million was voluntarily repaid, leaving us with €38 million of gross debt."",
  ""Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged."",
  ""We intend to deploy the cash generated within that same year or shortly thereafter."",
  ""We intend to return one-third of adjusted net income each year via interim and final dividends However, using own cash is the most likely and would most likely not defer dividends but might reduce capacity for share buybacks."",
  ""And we intend using a combination of debt repayments and share buybacks from the balance of cash."",
  ""Simonas will now cover the strategic progress."",
  ""In the next four slides I will update you on the KPIs for the each business unit."",
  ""The structure of the slides remains as usual, but to enhance the clarity for the C2C segment in the automotive and real estate markets, we have added additional KPIs."",
  ""Alongside active ads, we also disclosed listed ads."",
  ""The automotive market is performing well."",
  ""The number of transactions has increased by 7%, in Lithuania the average car price has risen slightly, while in Estonia it has decreased slightly."",
  ""Overall, the average car pricing across both countries remains at the same level as the last year."",
  ""In the middle right chart, you can see that private sellers have listed 1% more ads compared to the last year."",
  ""The active ads shown in the top right chart represent the inventory level on the platforms, which has Firstly, dealers have more inventory and they had to purchase more slots."",
  ""Secondly, our pricing and packaging After a slowdown in 2023-2024, the real estate market has entered a growth phase."",
  ""Market activity has increased with the number of transactions rising by 4%."",
  ""Average prices remain stable and market sentiment among the brokers is positive."",
  ""Both C2C and B2C dynamics are similar to auto, private sellers listed 2% more ads."",
  ""However, longer selling times had led to 20% increase in the C2C inventory."",
  ""Pricing adjustments introduced in the late spring and C2C customer base segmentation have resulted in 29% growth in the yield per listed ad."",
  ""I will give more color on customer segmentation later."",
  ""The number of B2C customers increased by 4%, while average revenue per broker grew by 19%."",
  ""This growth was primarily driven by an annual pricing and packaging event."",
  ""We maintained very strongly in both Lithuania and Estonia."",
  ""Our platforms are respectively 24 times and 15 times bigger than competitors."",
  ""Let's take a look at jobs and services."",
  ""The unemployment rate remained at the very low level of 7.6%, and average wage have grown significantly, increasing by 10% over the past year."",
  ""The market continues to provide a favorable environment for our business."",
  ""Companies are investing in their recruitment and retention of employees."",
  ""As shown in the bottom right chart, our customer base grew by 2% and average revenue per customer increased by 12%."",
  ""As you know, services segment represents the C2C part of our jobs and services unit."",
  ""You can see the chart in the top right."",
  ""This segment is the smallest one, but grows rapidly, both in volume and yield."",
  ""The number of active ads increased by 9% and the yield grew by 19%."",
  ""Our job board maintained a strong leadership position with a lead of 5 times over the closest competitor."",
  ""And this time we also reported the lead of our biggest vertical services vertical Paslaugos The main competitor is services category of our own generalist Skelbiu."",
  ""And as you can see, Paslaugos was 2 time bigger."",
  ""Our main Generalist Skelbiu in Lithuania accounts for 70% of the general business line revenue."",
  ""It is important to stress that it is not a typical Generalist."",
  ""Approximately 75% of its revenue is derived from vertical categories, automotive, real estate, jobs and services."",
  ""Therefore, Skelbiu competes with our own market leading verticals."",
  ""As Linda said, Skelbiu ranks as the sixth most visited website in Lithuania."",
  ""We strategically leverage Skelbiu to strengthen our vertical platforms."",
  ""We have the cross listing, which generates the high quality traffic for our vertical platforms, strengthening them even more."",
  ""Generalist platforms experienced moderate growth."",
  ""We had 6% less as than a year ago."",
  ""However, we increased the yield by 12% and our lead over the closest competitor in Lithuania remains as strong as ever of 19 times and in Estonia, 3 times."",
  ""As always, we are rolling out a lot of improvements to our platforms."",
  ""I would like to mention a few of them in the next two slides, starting with autos."",
  ""In Autoplius, we have introduced a market demand assessment tool for dealers."",
  ""This tool leverages the platform's data to generate the score that reflects supply and demand conditions."",
  ""Additionally, we have enhanced our support for dealers by offering a car buying tool."",
  ""This tool facilitates the sourcing of the vehicles from -within our platform."",
  ""Furthermore, our car history checks service have been incorporated into their premium B2C packages."",
  ""Our total 2024, we have introduced value-based pricing for our basic B2C package."",
  ""It features the At Aruodas, we have implemented the segmentation system for C2C self-service customers, which I have mentioned before."",
  ""It allows us to apply different monetization strategies for different segments like private sellers, developers and agents."",
  ""Additionally, we have introduced a new B2C package specifically designed for co-living projects."",
  ""At KV, we have significantly upgraded our map search functionality."",
  ""We improved accuracy and focused on user experience."",
  ""We have also elevated the quality of our listings by integrating data from the state registry."",
  ""This streamlines the listing process and also minimizes inaccuracies."",
  ""And let's move to jobs at CVBankas."",
  ""We have developed a proprietary AI matching tool."",
  ""It leverages large language models and custom embedding technology to match job offers and CVs."",
  ""We already utilized the model to recommend the best applicants for employers."",
  ""It saves our customers time needed for hiring."",
  ""The model has a wide range of potential applications including advanced search and CV data base, recommending job offers to both active and passive jobseekers and more."",
  ""At GetaPro.lv, we have introduced a value-added service that allows service providers to boost their visibility or to boost the visibility of their listings."",
  ""At Skelbiu, we have improved our fraud prevention program by incorporating additional security measures into the buyer to seller chat application."",
  ""Users are now required to verify their identity in case they are sharing some sensitive or potentially fraudulent information."",
  ""Otherwise, users cannot continue the conversation."",
  ""Now I would like to hand back to Justinas to finalize our presentation.""
]","[
  ""Three questions for me, please."",
  ""Firstly, it's great to see the outlook upgraded."",
  ""Could you help us think through the inventory assumptions underpinning your H2 guidance?"",
  ""Should we think, for example, you're assuming a flat inventory?"",
  ""If so, Secondly, inventory has been a tailwind for some time, which is very welcome."",
  ""But for some of your classified peers, they've had more challenging inventory trends recently."",
  ""How do you think about derisking the business from a reversal or weakness in inventory which may come down the road?"",
  ""Is that a strategic priority or should we think of inventory volatility as a fact of life?"",
  ""And it's the job And then the final question on M&A, the tone seems to have changed again."",
  ""Is it fair to observe that you're stepping away from doing deals, that the competition for assets and therefore prices is simply too high and therefore back to focusing on returns?"",
  ""Any color there would be helpful."",
  "" so much for the presentation."",
  ""Couple of questions for myself."",
  ""I guess firstly, could you just run through the outlook in terms of the key underlying drivers for each of your markets auto, real estate and job services in calendar year 2025."",
  ""So I guess, FY 2026 and onwards and how they align in terms of the KPIs and whether they'll be supportive."",
  ""And two, maybe just on your comments on the M&A process you participated in that you referred to in the previous question."",
  ""Could you give us any sense of which end market or country And maybe just one follow-up."",
  ""In terms of the specific process you referred to, was it within your current markets or was it outside M&A market in terms of geography?"",
  ""Just a couple for me."",
  ""First of all, on pricing, I mean, you've talked about getting pricing events through in May and October."",
  ""And where does your pricing sit next to the competitors?"",
  ""And do they use your pricing events to move theirs up or do they see it as an opportunity to try and take back some market share?"",
  ""I'd be quite interested in your thoughts on that."",
  ""And the second is just a technical one."",
  ""When you're using some of this cash for repaying the debt, are there any penalties for doing that?"",
  "", Will for the questions, as always quite a long list."",
  ""Hard to remember all of those, but just made a note."",
  ""Q – [0BHTHF-E Will Packer]>: Always."",
  ""But just remind me if you want elaborate on... Q – [0BHTHF-E Will Packer]>: Yeah, sure."",
  "" If you see the number of ads grew low-single-digits because we need to look at the number of listed ads and number of business customers to make a right assumptions."",
  ""So, basically already this year we are back to the normal level of inventory and the growth in terms of inventory is expected to be to grow in line with macro economical, let's say GDP growth."",
  ""On the – I think at the marketplace business has a great – it's in a great position basically when you have a headwind of inventory."",
  ""So it means usually the macro is performing very, very well and when the macro is performing very, very well."",
  ""So usually the marketplace press more a pricing lever."",
  ""In opposite, when you have a tailwind of inventory, it's likely that the macro or underlying is performing less well."",
  ""But For example, unless the economy is nice – not skyrocketing or not crashing completely."",
  ""So the sweet range for the marketplace, it's kind of quite, quite, quite large."",
  ""Basically, you can perform quite well with minus 2 macro or plus 2 GDP growth macroeconomic environment."",
  ""And the third question on M&A, I wouldn't say that our tone is lowering."",
  ""We are interested in M&A and we are looking at different M&A deals."",
  ""I guess maybe after the first half of the year, our tone was a bit higher because we knew that there will be an attractive asset coming on the market, which it's likely we will participate in the competition and we did participate."",
  ""But we kept all our criterias being disciplined in pricing."",
  ""We're being measuring and benchmarking the quality of assets compared to our own assets and in the end, we did not win that asset."",
  ""But looking at the past, we looked not at a single target."",
  ""We looked at quite a few of them in the last three years."",
  ""And I think that we will continue the same practice but also keeping the disciplined in line."",
  ""I think that I have said many, many times that, we are a very fine At the same time, if there will be an asset to acquire, we will look at it opportunistically."",
  ""If we like your market position, if we like – if we think that it's reasonably priced, then we will look at it."",
  ""Q – [0BHTHF-E Will Packer]>: I think you've answered everything."",
  "", Ciarán for the questions."",
  ""So on the second half of the year, we assume that the inventory has stabilized and the return to the normal levels."",
  ""So we anticipate that inventory levels will be similar to H1, applying low-single digit growth or being kind of closer – no, stable I would say with low-single digit growth."",
  ""And the assumptions for the growth will be mainly pricing events, which we had already in May and in October."",
  ""So, basically those both pricing events will have full impact on the second half of the year."",
  ""On M&A, I think that maybe just a bit, I will give a broader answer."",
  ""We really are true believers in the marketplace business."",
  ""And the key criteria for us when we are looking at the marketplace business is how dominant is the business, how high the leadership, how much bigger is compared to the closest competitor."",
  ""Because if it has a high leadership position, so it means that this business can have a pricing power."",
  ""And overall, most of the marketplace businesses are low in monetization because the take rates of 3% or 4% or 5% or even 6% are much lower take rates compared to So this is for the key criterias what we are looking at."",
  ""In terms of the territory and in terms of the countries, we are interested in well developed countries, including we consider Baltics to be a well-developed countries including Scandinavia, Central Europe, Western Europe, because it's important for a well-functioning marketplace."",
  ""It's important that the underlying markets are well-developed like property market is well-developed, automotive market is well-developed, jobs market is – there is economy, healthy economy and well-functioning economy for that."",
  ""So this is how we look."",
  ""And then if those criterias are met, we look at valuations and we have a very good benchmark."",
  ""The benchmark is our own valuation."",
  ""And overall, we think about our own assets very highly."",
  ""We think that these are the premium assets in terms of leadership, in terms of the low – being still low in monetization."",
  ""And we compare the other assets to our own assets."",
  ""And we always have this choice either to acquire another asset or to buy our own stock."",
  ""And then we make a decision."",
  ""So it has to meet a many criterias, including leadership, price of the asset."",
  ""And then for us, it's again, always a benchmarking to our own."",
  ""So to summarize, we are very happy to do M&A and we have done M&As in the past."",
  ""At the same time if we don't do, we are also very happy purchasing our own stock."",
  ""So we are not kind of – we don't feel a bit pressure to do M&A. It was not in our markets."",
  ""It was in Western Europe."",
  ""So I will answer the first question and then Lina will help me with the second one."",
  ""So on the first question, it depends how we look."",
  ""Our prices are much higher in absolute terms compared to our competitors."",
  ""But if you look in related terms, let's say price per lead."",
  ""So we are in many cases, cheaper."",
  ""So to give you an example, if we are 5 times more expensive than the closest competitor, but if we deliver 10 times more leads, so in fact, we are twice cheaper."",
  ""The pricing events usually, the marketplace business is the type of business where the winner takes it all."",
  ""So the more you push your own prices, the less you leave on the table."",
  ""And basically the less money is being spent on your competitor sites."",
  ""So usually, our repricing events are a negative thing for our competitors."",
  ""And they can't use it in your own advantage."",
  ""Lina, would you like to take the second question?Yes, in terms of the second question, our voluntary repayments of the debt is a part of our agreement with the lenders."",
  ""So no, we don't pay any penalties in relation to that."",
  ""We do have to cover expenses that lenders experience and result of our repayments, but those are in a few hundreds rather than anything significant.""

  "" for joining Unusual Machines' third quarter 2024 ."",
  ""Before I begin, our lawyers have absolutely asked me to read the Safe Harbor statement."",
  ""Please note that the company's remarks made during this call, including answers to questions and forward-looking statements, are subject to various risks and uncertainties."",
  ""These statements include our expected approval of more products for the Actual results may differ materially from the results predicted and the reporting results should not be considered as an indication of future performance."",
  ""A discussion of risks and uncertainties related to Unusual Machines' business is contained in its filings with the Security and Exchange Commission, including the prospectus filed with the SEC on October 25, 2024."",
  ""Further, it is difficult to predict that future tariffs will be imposed that affect our business and whether the wars in Ukraine and Israel will be affected by the US elections."",
  ""Additionally, we are dependent upon third parties in getting the Blue UAS Framework approval for our drone parts in a timely manner and receiving subsequent orders for our Made in USA drone parts and drones."",
  ""Unusual Machines disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of future developments."",
  ""That is out of the way."",
  ""This will be recorded and will be posted sometime in the next couple of days for those who aren't able to follow the whole thing."",
  ""We have some prepared remarks that we want to share to provide clarity on our third quarter results."",
  ""As usual, everyone, I apologize a little bit, I'm going to seem robotic because I'm reading."",
  ""But again, trust me, it is absolutely the best way to be sure you get all the information that we want to share."",
  ""After our comments, both Brian and I are going to be happy to answer questions in an open Q&A. Please throw those questions into there."",
  ""We'll go through and we'll read them off and we'll answer them at the end."",
  ""I will provide instructions on asking questions for those of you that aren't aware of how after our prepared remarks."",
  ""I think the most important thing and where I want to start is by absolutely recognizing the continued hard work our entire teams put in."",
  ""Guys, I really appreciate it."",
  ""This is only our third earnings report as a public company, so we're still pretty early."",
  ""This is actually only the first quarter where we have our own domestic manufactured products."",
  ""This represents for us the very beginning of our work toward growing this components business and onshoring production."",
  ""While this timeline probably feels slow to traders, it's happening very fast as operators are investors and is actually going a little faster than we originally anticipated."",
  ""For me, though, the most important thing is to continue to focus on our three key priorities, cash flow, operations and growth."",
  ""Cash flow is still a really big priority."",
  ""We started this quarter with about $2.2 million and we finished the quarter with about $1.7 million."",
  ""This matches and actually slightly – is slightly better than what we said we would do at the end of last quarter."",
  ""So, we're happy to be on target there."",
  ""Additionally, just at the end of October, we closed a pipe financing where we got another $1.7 million in net proceeds."",
  ""So, we're feeling pretty comfortable with our cash position and with our understanding and control of our cash burn rate."",
  ""With that, going forward we're planning on shifting a little more toward growth."",
  ""This is probably going to result in a slightly higher burn rate because we can aggressively capitalize on our components business."",
  ""And this can be a real competitive advantage for the potential change in tariffs and some of the other adjustments that we could expect from the new administration."",
  ""So we really see this as a window of opportunity where we can take some initiative and come out by materially improving both our top and bottom line over the next 12 months or so."",
  ""The second priority for us is operations."",
  ""For the quarter, we generated approximately $1.5 million in sales at a 26% gross margin."",
  ""This revenue is about a 9% increase over the second quarter and we still remain ahead of our target of $5 million in sales for 2024."",
  ""9% quarter-over-quarter is okay and you might be like The third priority for us and I'd say the big opportunity and why everyone here is growth."",
  ""I'm going to delay the discussions around the growth and what we see coming until Brian has a chance to dive into our financials more."",
  ""But before I hand it off to Brian, I want to discuss some of the So, in order to reduce our debt, interest payments and other cash spend, we negotiated conversion of a $1 million in our outstanding debt to equity with some shareholders and this was done at above market rates."",
  ""So, as part of this, we also negotiated with them to reduce the interest rate from 8% to 4%, which reduces the interest payments we have to make."",
  ""In doing this, we added a conversion feature at a $1.99, which is about $0.50 above our share price when we put it in place to see the cash reduction."",
  ""So, we think all this activity is really positive for the business, especially as we consider cash flow our primary priority, but it does create these like really funky GAAP derivatives that also have pretty high sensitivity to volatility and some other factors."",
  ""So, Brian,  so much for working through the derivative calculations."",
  ""I know that has been an exercise."",
  ""With that high level, I'm going to hand the call off to our CFO, Brian Hoff."",
  ""There are few items I want to clarify before we really dive into the exciting stuff."",
  ""All the debt conversion in the pipe have created some pretty substantial changes to our cap table."",
  ""So, in order to simplify things, I just want to explain to you guys how we as management see it."",
  ""We have common stock and then we have preferred stock and that preferred stock just converts to common stock."",
  ""It has a percentage blocker for ownership percentage, but no other gimmicks really."",
  ""So, if it all converted tomorrow, then our total common stock plus the preferred stock converted would be about 12.6 million shares."",
  ""So, you could say that we have 12.6 million shares outstanding or adjusted."",
  ""We have another set of things, which are cash-only warrants and some stock that we reserved for the conversion of debt."",
  ""Almost all of these warrants and that debt are -have a strike price or a conversion price of $1.99, but that $1.99 represents value and mostly cash or cash freed up to spend that the company would receive."",
  ""So, if all these warrants are exercised and all the debt is converted, the company will get about $7 million in additional value, most of it being cash."",
  ""This, as you would expect, represents about another 3.5 million shares, which is the $1.99 price."",
  ""So, there's no gimmicks there."",
  ""This conversion, these warrants, they were intentional."",
  ""We wanted to structure this to broadcast to everyone what our next financing is so that nobody surprised."",
  ""And you're able to do the calculations while understanding what our intent is to finance operations for the long term."",
  ""So, as part of finalizing all of this, we have a shareholder meeting on December 2."",
  ""It's important that you vote because we don't have shareholder concentration."",
  ""I can't just get anything to pass with five votes."",
  ""So, as I just mentioned we want to use the warrants as our next financing and that is why management suggests, yes, on item number 3, which is a share issuance above 19.9%."",
  ""It's not a shareholder approval for anything other than those warrant shares, et cetera, to be able to be used and convert it."",
  ""So, it's all already out there."",
  ""So, if you say, yes, we can get the money sooner because we can force conversion, we can simplify our cap table, and we can continue to really focus on operations."",
  ""So, please read your proxy statement and vote right after this call if you haven't yet."",
  ""Speaking of voting, we just had a major election that we expect will have some impact on the future of our company."",
  ""We are accelerating inventory orders and domestic production of new parts in anticipation of the benefits that we're going to see from a potential change in tariffs on Chinese-made drone parts."",
  ""We expect this will improve our gross margins on everything we make domestically and push our competitive pricing for the Chinese products up to a higher level."",
  ""This really galvanizes our growth plans."",
  ""And the election also does introduce a little uncertainty around the European market in 2025."",
  ""But you know before I dive into that, I really just also want to note that the comments I'm going to make about this are pretty speculative and they're sort of our current way that we're looking forward."",
  ""So, again, because we expect tariffs, we're working very hard to accelerate our US-made component business."",
  ""The Brave 7 was well received."",
  ""We expect to have a couple of products approved this quarter for the Blue list, a few more products next quarter."",
  ""And on top of that, the Brave 7 has been great because our team has done a wonderful job servicing the large customers that have placed orders."",
  ""So, we expect this component business to actually start to significantly contribute to our revenue in a more meaningful way in quarter four."",
  ""Right now, most of the initial larger orders are coming from Europe due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine."",
  ""There's definitely uncertainty here long term."",
  ""Like we don't know what the demand will be, what it looks like, how it looks like."",
  ""But in the short term, in the right now, there is massive demand and we are actually actively in the bidding process for what are large multimillion dollar contracts."",
  ""So, there could be some very immediate large orders that help us scale domestic production even faster."",
  ""So, in addition to the component sales for enterprise, we also have this really great opportunity to sell our US-made components individually or as part of our ready-to-fly drones through our retail channel."",
  ""If a tariff is put in place, our domestic components suddenly give us this extra 20% that we can use to either improve our gross margins or have more competitive pricing relative to our retail competitors."",
  ""So, if we manage this properly, I think we can use this advantage to improve both revenue and gross margin while capturing more market share in the retail business."",
  ""It would be challenging to have this call without talking about the US defense spending."",
  ""The defense spending from the US Department or the US government in the FPV category was definitely below our expectations in this last government fiscal year."",
  ""We see a long-term opportunity here still to do complete FPV drone products through our partnership with Red Cat Holdings."",
  ""We are still the selected supplier for the same drone and we also really hope to be a component provider for their other products, like the The next two months for the holiday season and this is typically the strongest quarter for us for retail sales."",
  ""So, we plan on really focusing on marketing, having a strong holiday, but also starting to position for when the new administration takes office in January."",
  ""We don't really expect to have great visibility into the B2B enterprise sales or any impacts from tariffs until the first quarter of next year because it's just so unknown."",
  ""But we're really optimistic that these changes could very quickly accelerate our growth plans."",
  ""Again, before I conclude my remarks, I want to say  again to our entire staff and also to everybody, all our shareholders."",
  ""This would be impossible without you, so ."",
  ""Please remember to vote after this call, but otherwise if you go and click the questions button and type questions, I'll read them out loud so they're recorded and I'll go through and start to answer questions."",
  "", Allan, and  to everyone for joining us this afternoon."",
  ""As Allan noted, we ended the three months ended September 30 at about $1.5 million in revenue with 26% gross margin, which is the 9% growth quarter-over-quarter, which again we're very excited about."",
  ""And this also puts us about $3.6 million with 28% gross margins year-to-date since the acquisitions of Fat Shark and Rotor Riot in February."",
  ""After revenue, I want to focus on our loss from operations, which is about $1.4 million for the quarter."",
  ""This includes As Allan mentioned a few moments ago, you'll also see the very unique line items on our P&L in other expenses and kind of non-operational loss, which is really all that derivative accounting, right?"",
  ""This kind of comes with the conversion of the debt and all of this is non-cash, just additional expense that GAAP really has us do and that's about $700,000, which leads to the net loss of $2.1 million."",
  ""Converting over to the balance sheet, as we noted, we had $1.7 million in cash, which is a little ahead and kind of in line with our expectations of what we were expecting when we were looking at it at the end of Q2."",
  ""We looked at – we just closed the pipe at the end of October for that $1.7 million in additional net proceeds."",
  ""Again, we are looking to head into the fourth quarter and into 2025 with a healthy cash position and excited about that."",
  ""We are also continuing to manage our inventory balances very closely and we ended the third quarter in line with our expectations, kind of came down a little bit."",
  ""But as we head into Q4, we are gearing up our inventory for that kind of holiday push."",
  ""We converted $1 million of our debt into equity, so we started with $4 million and now have a $3 million balance that's due at the end of November of 2025, so another year from now."",
  ""And then you'll see a couple other non-GAAP – I'm sorry, non-cash related liabilities, which is all that derivative stuff, which is another $600,000 worth of liabilities on our balance sheet."",
  ""In addition, we still have the $19.6 million of goodwill, kind of other unallocated purchase price, which we're going through those GAAP accounting related items to kind of figure out what that is going to look like at the end of the year."",
  ""And we should have the allocations to any other intangibles completed by the end of the year."",
  ""Overall, we're excited about the progress we've made since kind of the IPO, the acquisition of the two companies and especially heading into the fourth quarter."",
  ""We've got a full quarter of our Blue UAS Brave F7 Flight Controller orders being fulfilled during this quarter and also the larger holiday push, which we were thinking Q4 is going to be one of our best quarters."",
  ""So, we feel confident in our current cash position to allow us to focus on those growth opportunities, which is a great place to kick it back over to Allan.""
]","[
  ""So, we got a few in here."",
  ""The first one, why do you think the US DoD was slower or didn't materialize like you expected?"",
  ""The US DoD procurement, I think just gotten jammed up in bureaucracy."",
  ""If you look the – there was a continuing resolution, so they didn't get their budgets so late and then it's a long process to get the money through."",
  ""And so I think they were just focused on other priorities and ran out of time, is what we saw with a lot of them."",
  ""And I think we're going to see some delays again this coming year."",
  ""I think we're going to see continuing resolution until January because of the change in government administration."",
  ""And I don't know how short-term disruptive some of the – those activities are going to be to procurement versus long term."",
  ""So, I think the money for this category from the Department of Defense is going to be a little uncertain, is short term."",
  ""Who are your partners, customers that get you into the US DoD, assuming you do not sell directly?"",
  ""We are not a prime."",
  ""We don't want to be a direct contract to the US government."",
  ""So, we'll work with several others."",
  ""The one that we're the most familiar with and have probably put out there is Red Cat Holdings."",
  ""But as a supplier to anyone, we're open to working with anyone that needs components in our category."",
  ""So, here's the next question."",
  ""It's good to see other demand offset the DoD. Do you think the DoD is more of a delay or something else?"",
  ""I think the US DoD is a delay and I think that we're still going to see we are on a delay from the US DoD, because we sell to the people that get the DoD contracts."",
  ""So, if you look short-range reconnaissance program and that Red Cat is participating in was originally supposed to be announced in September, hasn't been announced yet."",
  ""Those delays then cascade on to supplier like us because we don't get orders for components or did the slots for components until they see their order."",
  ""So, I think we'll start to see some of the delay come through and we'll start to see our relationships with some of those primes manifest."",
  ""Can you walk us through how you're able to price above the market and how the warrants with strike price of $1.99 are likely to play out?"",
  ""What we did is we had a very long conversation with a lot of our shareholders."",
  ""They believe very strongly in what we're doing, so they're willing to do a penny above market."",
  ""And if they look at this more – we look at it more like venture where we want to disclose it."",
  ""So, it's like here's half the round, here's the next half of the round if we can prove that it works."",
  ""A lot of the warrants or at least some of the warrants have the company right to ask them to convert at $3 a share."",
  ""So, I expect what we'll see after registration and it goes forward people to look and we'll try to convert those warrants."",
  ""I think it's very share price dependent."",
  ""But if we're – where we're at today, I think they'll convert very quickly and then we'll be fully capitalized with a very clean cap table and able to just continue to operate."",
  ""And so how they play out is really dependent on how shareholders, if they believe in the company and if they say, hey, yeah, you guys are doing it, keep going."",
  ""Then as long as we're in a place where we can push that conversion, all our shareholders are very interested and supporting us, and I think would be very willing to convert."",
  ""What are your contingency plans if the US tariffs are imposed?"",
  ""I think if the faster tariffs are imposed, the more it advantages us in the retail market and everywhere else."",
  ""So, if they're not imposed, I think we're okay too."",
  ""So, I don't think we need contingency plans there."",
  ""Just idea that they're going to come has actually caused us to accelerate and move toward that growth in a way where we want to do more of it faster."",
  ""The next question, was converting the debt really worth it?"",
  ""Anytime we can reduce cost bases, we can eliminate debt, which we could have to pay at a future point."",
  ""Anytime we can clean this up, especially, I think with the terms under which we cleaned it up, we would do it again."",
  ""I think we may change how we structure it to save Brian some time, but that's about it."",
  ""Is there a risk we've not delivered the demand in production?"",
  ""There's always some risk when you're doing hardware that you have a hiccup or you have a recall or whatever."",
  ""But we're – we believe that we could get orders for some of our components at $100,000 a month and we've already structured our supply chain to be able to scale in and deliver to that if necessary."",
  ""So, we don't see any extraordinary risks from scaling."",
  ""It would be a challenge, but we have a plan to do it, and we've been able to do some of these things before."",
  ""So, I feel very confident in that, particularly for certain components."",
  ""And we've had discussions with suppliers, et cetera, in case we see that level of demand."",
  ""So, we feel pretty good actually about our ability to address it."",
  ""And I mean it would be awesome."",
  ""So, we're hoping to really face that challenge and I think we're in a good position to do it at this point."",
  ""That's all the questions so far."",
  ""If anybody else has questions, log them in there."",
  ""Oh, we got another one."",
  ""Will it be necessary to achieve net profitability in order to pay off debt maturing in 2025?"",
  ""We don't need to achieve net profitability."",
  ""We – we are managing cash flow, but if you look, we structured the conversion on that debt at a $1.99."",
  ""So that as long as we're executing, that's part of that $7 million in value, is that debt would go away."",
  ""We'd get about another $4 million in cash from the warrants with the cash we have now."",
  ""We wouldn't have to stop and get distracted by some of those things."",
  ""And if you really look, particularly with the change in the administration and this shift to this Next question."",
  ""What are the video quality and engineering metrics that define the competition frontier?"",
  ""That really depends on the components on the category."",
  ""I think it's missing a very key aspect, which is what is the price?"",
  ""So, I think there is – and all these categories, good, better, best, I think it depends on the use case, if it's conflicts in Europe versus if it's domestic."",
  ""But I do think if you want to dive into it further, send us a note at ir@redcatholdings and we'd be happy to go through how we look at our product development and where we see it competitively."",
  ""And next one, what is the split between enterprise and consumer?"",
  ""And within enterprise, what does the concentration look like?"",
  ""Right now, the split is pretty much all consumer, so we just had one month of sales that were enterprise."",
  ""The concentration is a little bit unknown because it's so small."",
  ""We had one large customer that we're starting to work with in that quarter, but we hadn't really started shipping a whole bunch."",
  ""So, I think we'll be able to answer that question better at the end of this quarter, at the end of quarter one, and we'll really know what it looks like."",
  ""Also, I'd like to apologize, it's investors@unusualmachines.com."",
  ""I gave you the Red Cat email."",
  ""I'm hard-wired to know that one still from my time there, do I'm sorry."",
  ""Again, I really appreciate everybody."",
  ""We try to be as candid as possible and share with you how we're seeing things."",
  ""So, really appreciate your time."",
  ""I'll give it about another minute."",
  ""But if there are no other questions, then we'll be able to end the call."",
  ""It doesn't seem like there are any other questions."",
  ""Again, everybody,  so much for your time."",
  ""I hope you guys have a great holiday season."",
  ""Please reach out investors@unusualmachines if you have additional questions."",
  ""And I hope you guys have a great evening.""

  ""The third quarter was marked by disciplined execution of our plan, which allow us to deliver results above our expectation, driven by the timing of snowmobile shipment and tight management of operating expenses."",
  ""Our retail performance was as anticipated, reflecting a challenging market dynamic due to soft industry trend and high level of promotional activity on non-current unit from other OEMs."",
  ""We have remained focused on reducing network inventory, and we are pleased with the solid progress made so far."",
  ""Based on retail trend, we are on track to deliver on our objective for the year."",
  ""Before going further, I want to say a few words on our decision to sell our Marine businesses."",
  ""After careful consideration and given the current dynamic of both the marine and powersport industry, we have decided to double down on our core Powersports activities."",
  ""We aim to focus our effort and investment toward this business to capitalize on growth opportunity and continue to position BRP for long-term success."",
  ""Consequently, we initiated the process for the sales of our Marine businesses, namely Alumacraft, Manitou and Telwater."",
  ""We continue operating in the normal course of business."",
  ""But as Philippe mentioned, we are now reporting our result on a continuing operation basis and our guidance reflect this new reporting structure."",
  ""You will understand that since the sales process is ongoing, we cannot comment further on today's call."",
  ""Now, let's turn to slide 5 for key financial highlight."",
  ""Revenue reached CAD 2 billion, normalized EBITDA was CAD 264 million and normalized EPS was CAD 1.16, all above expectation."",
  ""One of the key highlight of the quarter was the progress made on our network inventory reduction plan, as you can see on slide 6."",
  ""This plan was one of our priorities this year to protect our dealer value proposition."",
  ""We have made significant stride toward our 15% to 20% reduction objective by the end of this fiscal year."",
  ""Inventory is down 10% so far, given the timing of snowmobile shipment this year."",
  ""More importantly, in ORV, it is down 22%, achieving our objective one quarter ahead of plan."",
  ""We have also seen noticeable improvement on three-wheeled vehicle, personal watercraft and Switch pontoons."",
  ""This put us in a favorable position to capture market opportunity when the industry rebound and to foster long-term profitable growth."",
  ""Turning to slide 7 for an update on the global powersport market."",
  ""The third quarter was consistent with trend observed since the beginning of the year."",
  ""In North America, our powersport retail was down 11%, in line with expectation, with Canada continuing to outperform the US market."",
  ""From an international perspective, EMEA remained generally under pressure with our retail down 19%."",
  ""Latin America continued to grow at a rapid pace, with our retail up 21%, driven by a strong performance in both ORV and personal watercraft."",
  ""And Asia-Pacific saw mixed performance depending on the country, with the retail flat on average."",
  ""Overall, these counter-seasonal markets had a better start to the summer season than expected."",
  ""Turning to slide 8 for a look at North American retail performance by product line."",
  ""As expected, we experienced a decline in ORV, as limited availability of non-current unit reduced in market share – resulted in market share losses and a soft start to the snowmobile season, which is typical after a year with unfavorable snow condition."",
  ""Meanwhile, personal watercraft had a better end of season than anticipated."",
  ""Let's turn to slide 9 to circle back to the ORV market dynamic."",
  ""As you can see, about two-third of side-by-side vehicle and close to 90% of the ATV industry unit retail this quarter was non-current."",
  ""This dynamic is the result of intense promotional activity by other OEMs, who had higher level of non-current units."",
  ""In our case, we had limited non-current availability, which resulted in short-term market share loss."",
  ""However, we gained share in the more profitable current unit, driven by our newly introduced product and the overall strength of our line-up."",
  ""We expect this dynamic to persist at least through the fourth quarter, but our strong performance with current unit gave us confidence that we will regain market share when the inventory position of other OEMs normalize."",
  ""Now, let's turn to slide 10 for a look at the launch of our Can-Am electric motorcycle line-up."",
  ""The team has been busy raising awareness with consumers and the media, preparing the dealer network for the official start of the 2025 retail season, and showcasing the product in key events such as EICMA, the largest motorcycle trade show in the world."",
  ""I attended the show and I was pleased to notice the excitement for our technology and innovative design, as well as the fit and finish of our Can-Am Pulse and Origin Motorcycle."",
  ""The launch is well underway."",
  ""We are approaching our targeted number of dealer globally."",
  ""Production is ramping up in December and shipment will start at the beginning of fiscal 2026."",
  ""We look forward to our first season in the electric motorcycle industry."",
  ""Now, let's turn to slide 11 for a more detailed look at Year-Round Products."",
  ""Revenues were down 12% to CAD 1 billion, primarily reflecting reduced shipment."",
  ""At retail, Can-Am side-by-side was down mid single-digit, slightly lower than the industry, due to the non-current dynamic."",
  ""However, we continue gaining share in the utility segment, led by the ongoing success of our high-end Defender Cabs models."",
  ""As for ATV, retail was also down mid single-digits."",
  ""We have gained about 4 percentage point of market share so far this year in the mid-cc segment, driven by the introduction of our new Outlander platform."",
  ""As a reminder, we have also introduced this platform in the high-cc segment in August."",
  ""Looking at three-wheeled vehicle, Can-Am completed its 2024 season in October with retail down high-teen percent, outpacing the industry, which was down about 20%."",
  ""While the season was more challenging than initially expected, we are pleased with continued market share gain that solidified our position as the industry leader."",
  ""Turning to Seasonal Products on slide 12, revenue were down 29% to CAD 616 million, primarily reflecting lower shipment."",
  ""In snowmobile, we proactively reduced production level, given higher inventory following last winter unfavorable snow condition."",
  ""Our retail is performing in line with the industry early in the season despite lower level of non-current inventory compared to our peers."",
  ""We are confident in our ability to outperform the market, given our innovative line-up, as well as our loyal and passionate customer base."",
  ""As for PWC, we ended the season with retail down in the high-20% range, lagging the industry, as our competitor returned to normal production levels."",
  ""Despite this situation, our retail was better than anticipated at the end of the season, which we concluded with the number one position in the industry and a market share above pre-COVID levels."",
  ""However, since our retail performance for the whole season was below initial expectation, we ended with more inventory than planned and we will reduce shipment for the upcoming season."",
  ""As for the Sea-Doo Switch, we ended the season with retail down mid-40%, as we are – as we were lapping the strong success of our first full season last year and facing a soft pontoon industry this year."",
  ""We're looking forward for a more normal season 2025 for Switch."",
  ""Moving on to slide 13 with Powersports Parts, Accessories & Apparel and OEM Engines, revenue were down 6% to CAD 303 million, primarily due to lower shipment of snowmobile PA&A, given higher level of inventory in the network after last season."",
  ""Our ORV parts business continued to increase, driven by growing vehicle fleet, while accessories sales have been softer, in line with unit retail."",
  ""With that, I turn the call over to Sébastien."",
  ""BRP has once again proven to be an agile organization in this transition year."",
  ""We were the first OEM to prioritize network inventory depletion, and we are on track to reach our objective by the end of the fiscal year."",
  ""I am proud of our team execution to protect the strength of our dealer network and the value of our brands."",
  ""I thank all of our employees for their commitment."",
  ""Even though it is too early to give detail for next year, we will enter fiscal 2026 with a strong product portfolio and an improved inventory position."",
  ""Driven by our solid business fundamental, we are uniquely placed to capture opportunities when the market rebound."",
  ""As a global organization, we constantly monitor the macroeconomic and trade environment to anticipate and address any new policy developments."",
  ""We are used to dealing with the evolving trade agreement and have always succeeded in finding solution to new tariff."",
  ""Looking to the long-term, we remain focused on solidifying our position as a global leader in the powersport industry."",
  ""You can expect us to continue pushing technology and innovation."",
  ""We have repeatedly proven our ability to design award-winning product, and we recently took home six new design award in Australia, Japan and the US."",
  ""These distinction stem from our sustained investment in R&D. Count on us to continue to wow consumers with our strong product pipeline in the coming years."",
  ""On that note, I turn the call over to the operator for questions."",
  ""Joining me this morning are José Boisjoli, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Sébastien Martel, Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Before we move to the prepared remarks, I would like to remind everyone that certain forward-looking statements will be made during the call and that the actual results could differ from those implied in these statements."",
  ""The forward-looking information is based on certain assumptions and is subject to risk and uncertainties, and I invite you to consult BRP's MD&A for a complete list of these."",
  ""Additionally, note that following the announcement of the initiation of the process for the sale of our Marine businesses, these businesses are now presented as discontinued operations."",
  ""Therefore, all periods presented in this release reflect continuing operation only, unless otherwise noted."",
  ""Also note that you can find today's presentation on our website at brp.com under the Investor Relations section."",
  ""So, with that, I'll turn the call over to José."",
  ""Our third quarter results once again demonstrated our commitment to support our dealers, as we were disciplined in limiting our shipments to reduce our network inventory levels."",
  ""From a financial perspective, our results came in ahead of plan, as we continued to diligently manage our expenses and we shifted some deliveries of snowmobiles, which were initially planned for Q4."",
  ""Before jumping into the numbers, I want to remind you that the following represents the results from continuing operations, as our Marine business has been reclassified as discontinued operation."",
  ""Now, looking at the numbers, revenues were down 18% to CAD 2 billion, primarily due to lower shipments and higher sales programs."",
  ""We generated CAD 430 million in gross profit, representing a margin of 22%, down from last year, primarily due to the less efficient use of our assets, given the lower production volumes and higher sales programs."",
  ""These were partly offset by a richer product mix, especially in SSV, and through favorable pricing."",
  ""Our normalized EBITDA ended at CAD 264 million and our normalized earnings per share at CAD 1.16."",
  ""To help you compare these results to our initial expectations for the quarter, assuming we would have reported with Marine included in our numbers, our normalized EPS would have been CAD 0.91."",
  ""Turning to slide 16 for an update on the guidance."",
  ""As we already mentioned, the third quarter played out generally in line with our expectations."",
  ""Our retail performance was consistent with our outlook, and we made good progress on a network inventory reduction plan, putting us in a good position to achieve our objective for the year."",
  ""Looking ahead, while our Q3 results came in above our expectations, they benefited from the timing of shipments of snowmobiles between the third and fourth quarter, and as such, the net impact on the full year is negligible."",
  ""Additionally, while there are only two months left to go in our fiscal year, we are keeping some flexibility in our guidance to account for the fact that the main snowmobile retail season has yet to start and the potential adjustments we may make to our shipments and sales programs as we continue to prioritize the right-sizing of network inventory levels."",
  ""Consequently, we are reaffirming our guidance for the year and are maintaining the same guidance ranges."",
  ""Note, however, that our guidance is now presented on a continuing operations basis."",
  ""So, the changes that you are seeing in today's guidance when compared to the one we issued in September are simply driven by this reclassification."",
  ""As such, we now expect our revenues to end between CAD 7.6 billion and CAD 7.8 billion; normalized EBITDA to end between CAD 1,020 million and CAD 1,070 million; and normalized EPS to end between CAD 4.25 and CAD 4.75."",
  ""Now, to give you an appreciation of the impact of the sale of our Marine business on our financial profile, let's look at slide 17."",
  ""As José mentioned, we took the decision to sell our Marine segment to refocus on our core Powersports business."",
  ""We strongly believe that doubling down on powersport, an industry in which we have a solid track record of success, is the right move forward for BRP, as our most attractive opportunities are in Powersports, especially in ORV, and our core Powersports business has a much more attractive financial profile and investments in this sector have greater expected returns."",
  ""To highlight the benefit of this decision on our financial profile, we have illustrated on the slide the evolution of the guidance compared to the one we issued last quarter."",
  ""As you can see, by comparing the two, that our continuing operations are expected to generate about CAD 130 million more of normalized EBITDA, improve our normalized EBITDA margin by 200 basis point, and increase the normalized EPS by CAD 1.50."",
  ""Additionally, excluding our discontinued operations, our expectations in terms of free cash flow generation for the year would have been about CAD 100 million higher."",
  ""While this was a difficult decision to make, we expect that our exit of Marine will improve our ability to capitalize on high-return opportunities in the Powersports space through greater focus and financial capabilities."",
  ""We are confident that this will enable us to strengthen our position as the leader in the industry and make BRP an even stronger company for the long-term."",
  ""On this, I will turn the call back to José.""
]","[
  ""José, understanding you're going to give official guidance at the next quarter, if I can just maybe tease out any directional perspectives on sort of your three Powersports segments and anything on seasonality as we look ahead to fiscal 2026."",
  ""Obviously, some clearing out to do in Q4 here, but any directional commentary you can provide on what you're seeing out there would be great."",
  ""And then, just on the follow-up, you announced the renewal of your NCIB this morning."",
  ""Given where the balance sheet's at and your outlook for next year, just any comments on how active you might be on the return of capital front?"",
  "" for taking my call."",
  ""So, obviously, a better-than-expected Q3 sounds like to the tune of CAD 0.30 to CAD 0.35."",
  ""I guess, A, how big of a benefit was the snowmobile timing?"",
  ""Obviously, that's going to be a wash between Q3 and Q4."",
  ""But I guess what I'm wondering is, the inventory right-sizing seems to happen – seems to have happened a little bit earlier, which would seem to mean you won't need to undershoot retail by as much in Q4, and then it looks like the tax rate came down as well."",
  ""So, kind of feels like the landing point for earnings should be at least modestly better."",
  ""Maybe help us tease out those factors."",
  ""And then, maybe just a point of clarification on the inventory piece."",
  ""I think coming out of the first half, you were saying total inventories were down 13% and your target was 15% to 20%."",
  ""Now, you're saying they're down 10%."",
  ""Now, we've pulled out Marine."",
  ""So, I'm assuming that's part of the disconnect."",
  ""So, maybe, I don't know, what was the first half year-to-date inventory decline to compare to the current down 10% and what is, in the new world, the target for the year?"",
  ""Just wanted to follow up on James' line of question here a little bit."",
  ""If you think about 2026 at a high level – and again, I understand no guidance today."",
  ""But if you end this year with network inventory down 15%, let's say, and we assume the industry is flattish next year, and I think you said earlier that wholesale and retail should largely be in alignment, why wouldn't we see a pretty sizable lift in shipments next year?"",
  ""And just to follow up on that, the non-currents that are in the channel today, we're obviously going into the off-season for a lot of that."",
  ""How long do you think it'll take to flush out some of that inventory?"",
  ""I'll see you guys next week."",
  ""Just with respect to the launch of the electric motorcycle, I was just curious, the – obviously, shipments will start fiscal year 2026 early."",
  ""But what kind of contribution on revenue we could expect next year?"",
  ""My understanding, maybe not material, but I'm also curious to kind of gauge what could be the dilution on the margins and the impact next year."",
  ""And just for the follow-up, when we look at the powersport market right now, obviously, it's crowded, especially when we count the number of side-by-side manufacturers."",
  ""So, there's probably be some natural selection."",
  ""Yamaha is exiting the snowmobile market."",
  ""So, a question mark around Arctic Cat."",
  ""So, any early indication that some ORV manufacturers are looking to exit?"",
  ""And given that some players are impacted, is there any willingness on your part to be involved in potential M&A that would complement your current product offering?"",
  ""Can you please remind us what the change in dealer count in the US is for your ORV dealer channel?"",
  ""And I don't know if you'll really have any color to add, given the unknowns out there."",
  ""But do you have any thoughts on the potential tariff situation and what kinds of mitigating actions you may be able to take or potential to shift production to some facilities that may be for sale now in the US for other product lines, but where you could potentially move some production?"",
  ""Just kind of – I don't know if you – I know it's still early in the process of what may take place."",
  ""And so, just any thoughts there."",
  ""I'm wondering if you can maybe comment a little bit about what you're seeing as far as dealer behavior as it relates to interest rate reductions."",
  ""And maybe the way to do that is maybe to compare and contrast what you're seeing out of your Canadian dealers versus US dealers, because we have had, I guess, a more aggressive interest rate reductions in Canada versus US."",
  ""So, I'm just – and it does seem as though your retail performance in Canada is maybe doing a little better."",
  ""So, I'm just wondering if you can maybe talk about what you're hearing from your dealers as far as the impact of interest rate cuts, and maybe the way to do that is compare Canada versus US."",
  ""Maybe just a quick maybe modeling question for Séb."",
  ""Just wondering about the G&A line item here on the cost side, just wondering if the Q3 is a decent run rate as we look forward, just now we have the Marine out of the business."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""You've addressed many of them, but maybe I'll just ask a follow-up on the tariff issue."",
  ""Understood none of us can really predict the future on that front."",
  ""But what percentage of your cost of goods sold are sourced out of China?"",
  ""And then, what percentage of your production today is in Mexico, just to help those of us trying to guess at that impact?"",
  ""And then, on 2026, again, I know you're not providing guidance, but you're saving essentially CAD 1.50 in loss avoidance related to Marine in 2025."",
  ""But it should be very clear that the benefit next year is much smaller than that, because you weren't expecting to lose maybe the same amount."",
  ""I want to go back to a previous answer you – on the non-current models."",
  ""You seemed optimistic to – that the non-current inventory, I believe that was the industry you were talking about, would clear in the coming next quarter or two."",
  ""I just wanted to understand a little bit where we are today in terms of industry units of non-current versus historical level."",
  ""If you can provide that, it would be helpful."",
  ""And then, what – why are you optimistic that all those non-current models will clear out in a short order?"",
  ""And maybe just another quick one for me, just trying to see a little bit how your dealers are approaching 2025."",
  ""How is their financial position, given the industry has been challenging?"",
  ""Are some of the dealers hurt from a financial standpoint and have you started to see some delays in payments from dealers?"",
  ""You gave a little bit of guardrails in terms of next year for revenues and maybe OpEx."",
  ""Can you talk a little bit about how we should think about gross margin, gross margin ex Marine next year, and are some of the puts and takes there?"",
  ""And then, on the current units, you kind of showed that slide showing how your sales for the current inventory is really strong."",
  ""I guess, what do you think that's – what's driving that?"",
  ""And how does that give you confidence into next year in terms of maybe gaining share as well, if inventory gets clean?"",
  ""Most of them have been asked."",
  ""But I guess just one for you, José."",
  ""Can you discuss if you've seen any change in consumer sentiment post-elections?"",
  ""Have you seen any signs of increased optimism around the consumer?"",
  ""I'll get back in queue."",
  ""I guess what we haven't talked about yet is what the used market looks like right now and maybe how the behavior in the used market could impact the consumer takeaway of new units in the year ahead."",
  ""So, have you guys seen any noteworthy trends on maybe whether prices have been decelerating or volume has been increasing in that used channel, just to help us triangulate the entire inventory picture across the industry?"",
  ""And then, I think earlier in the call, you said the current expectation for next year is for a flat industry."",
  ""Are there any number of interest rate cuts baked into that?"",
  ""I'm just trying to think about the sort of bull case and bear case scenarios from where your current point is."",
  ""I was hoping just to follow up on an earlier line of questioning on the dealer health and dealer profitability, maybe coming at it from a different angle."",
  ""If we were to frame up where dealer sentiment stands as of today, because there are a lot of moving parts, on the one hand, it sounds like the inventory picture is getting a bit better, but the end customer demand has yet to really come back or materialize."",
  ""But I mean, as you pointed out, they are making as much money as they were pre-COVID."",
  ""It sounds like maybe the sentiment is a little bit detached from that."",
  ""But overall, where would you say dealer sentiment stands today as of perhaps this time last year or let's say pre-COVID levels?"",
  ""And then, as my follow-up, Séb, you mentioned the incremental 50 basis points that you expect to get as far as the OpEx rate goes."",
  ""What do you have in the pipeline, I guess, as far as cost savings programs or how much of that is going to be allocated towards specific cost savings programs or process efficiencies versus sales leverage?"",
  ""Just a point of clarification, the floor plan financing, the 70% that you're covering, how does that work?"",
  ""Is that something that gets dealers through into next selling season or is it a certain amount of time post whenever they receive a unit?"",
  ""So, it's safe to assume maybe we get a little bit of carry-over into 1Q of next year?"",
  ""And Séb, I appreciate all the details on the puts and takes of next year."",
  ""One, when I think about the season-end inventory in PWC and the Switch, you did provide the surplus inventory for snowmobiles back in Q1."",
  ""I think you said destocking was 30% or CAD 350 million."",
  ""Can you provide the metrics for the Okay."",
  ""And then, I guess my second question is you're clearly in great shape in side-by-side inventory, and that's a real benefit."",
  ""I just wonder if you'd play devil's advocate here."",
  ""Do you expect to lose ORV market share next year?"",
  ""And the reason why I ask is I'm curious, how do you address retaining loyalty if consumers are baited by the promo on the heavy non-current of competitors, because the entire industry is challenged until this clears, correct?"",
  ""I think I agree with that, José."",
  ""I'm just curious as to, if you lose a customer because they go non-current, how do you get them back?"",
  ""I just wanted to understand the dynamic."",
  ""I mean, obviously, we don't expect we will give you guidance for next year this morning."",
  ""But we are planning for a flattish industry overall with this market dynamic, and I believe we're well-positioned with our product line."",
  ""We have the off-road business."",
  ""Right now, we're losing some market share because we have less non-current than some of our competitor."",
  ""But we have a very strong product line-up with the off-road business, and you can expect from us next year to introduce again new exciting model."",
  ""On the Seasonal Products, Ski-Doo, snowmobile season is ongoing."",
  ""The snow was a bit late, but now it's catching up, and we expect a good retail this season."",
  ""In watercraft, you know that we ended the inventory with higher inventory than planned."",
  ""But we're counting on next summer season to rebalance the inventory."",
  ""Then, in the Parts and Accessories business, it's quite resilient."",
  ""The Parts business is doing quite well."",
  ""Accessories typically is in line with the sales of the unit."",
  ""But overall, we are well-positioned to be very competitive within the industry."",
  ""Maybe I will start with the – some comments on the inventory."",
  ""We're very happy with the progress we made on off-road."",
  ""Now, we are at the level we believe we should be at."",
  ""The big question between now and when we stock in March will be snowmobile."",
  ""We're planning obviously a retail season that is with a better snow condition than last year."",
  ""But this will be key between now and the end of Q4 to see how the retail of snowmobile will go and the depletion of inventory."",
  ""Good progress, like I said in my intro, on Switch three-wheeled product, very, very happy of the depletion there."",
  ""And watercraft, we'll discuss about next season."",
  ""Then, what we are happy of our progress on inventory, because at the end of the day, the dealer and us make more money selling current than selling non-current at discount."",
  ""We believe that most of it should go out in Q4."",
  ""Maybe certain areas, center dealers, maybe some in Q1 next year."",
  ""But we believe in the next two quarter, most of the non-current should be flushed out."",
  ""First, we're very happy with the way the motorcycle is received right now."",
  ""And I know it is not the best timing worldwide to introduce an electric product."",
  ""But I will say what I'm pleased with, every dealer who are hesitant to be a dealer first year or every customer that we – or maybe they were somewhat questioning, and now when they try the product, they are very pleased with the ride, the silence, the performance and the overall experience of the product."",
  ""And so far, we are on plan."",
  ""We are also on plan to sign the dealer count."",
  ""We said we're targeting 300 dealer first year."",
  ""We will be there when we start shipment."",
  ""And overall, this will be the first roll-out."",
  ""But again, first year, we are somewhat Obviously, Benoit, we're following, like all of you, the dynamic in the industry and the position of each OEM to the industry."",
  ""I agree with you there is some dynamic, and I think that the industry will change over time."",
  ""But obviously, you cannot expect me to comment on M&A or different possibility."",
  ""There is hundreds of possibility out there."",
  ""But the industry is going through a transition."",
  ""There is some OEM that have more difficulty than others."",
  ""The only thing I can say, I'm very, very happy where we are, because we have strong product line-up in each product line we operate, and by refocusing on powersport, I think we will accelerate our plan."",
  ""As you know, Robin, we're closely obviously monitoring the situation, and at this time, there is hundreds of different possibility."",
  ""But as a global company, we optimize over the years our manufacturing footprint and our supply chain to meet customer demand and be efficient."",
  ""Then, we have a long history of managing through trade and tariff requirement between Canada, US and Mexico, but also between other country around the world."",
  ""We've always been able to navigate the changing – the change in the geopolitical landscape, and we are a leader in the industry."",
  ""Then, the only thing I can say at this time, and I know it's top of mind for many investor, but we have the team, we have the know-how, and we will adapt to the change."",
  ""And I don't think we need – we should overreact right now because we can speculate at this – and we should not speculate too much because there is, like I said, hundreds of different possibility."",
  ""Then, I just want to say to you and to the investor, we're monitoring the situation, and rest assured, if needed, we will adapt and we will take action in the best interest of the customers, the employee and the shareholders."",
  ""I think the dealer recognize first that we're the first one in the industry to lead the charge to reduce inventory, and they appreciate what we're doing."",
  ""And obviously, right now, they see the progress we're doing on off-road."",
  ""They see the progress that we've done on three-wheel and smaller product line."",
  ""But they see the progress that we're doing there."",
  ""We had the inventory of 2024."",
  ""Then, the inventory of snowmobile is high right now, but it's normal at this time of the year."",
  ""And at least now the snow came in the Snow Belt and it feels good overall beginning of the snowmobile season."",
  ""Then, the dealers see the difference and they recognize what we're doing."",
  ""We just need to go over the hump of the snowmobile season."",
  ""And if the retail is decent with the normal snow season, I think the pressure will go down."",
  ""And we are planning a reasonable watercraft season next year."",
  ""We ended with more inventory, but we're planning to reduce shipment of 2025 to make sure we end the season clean."",
  ""Then, I think the dealers see where we're going."",
  ""They appreciate where we're going."",
  ""But we need to deliver with them the retail on snow and watercraft."",
  ""But I don't see any big difference between Canada and US."",
  ""The only thing I would say in Canada, every single dealer almost sell snowmobile, when in US, the dealer in the South feel already better with the reduction that we have done on ORV."",
  ""First, overall in Q3, the trend with consumer didn't change."",
  ""As you know and as we said a few times, we don't have any data on the used market."",
  ""Then, the only thing we can say is what we hear from the dealers."",
  ""The used, obviously, like the non-current right now is getting some retail."",
  ""But we don't see I think the dealer – many dealer has to somewhat right-size their business the way we're doing it."",
  ""And the dealer in US very often carry five, six, seven OEMs, and they need to right-size their business."",
  ""What I mean by that, decide with who they prefer to work."",
  ""It's quite rare that the dealer will drop a product line or a brand, but they could decide to buy less of that brand and buy more of that other brand."",
  ""And this is why we're betting on our approach to improve inventory of BRP product, have a better inventory turnover, and prove to the dealer then when they sell a BRP product, they make more money than selling other brand where they carry more inventory."",
  ""Then, I would say many dealer right now are in that process of right-sizing or maybe realigning their priorities inside their dealership, and we believe we can play a positive role there."",
  ""But the theory that – and the philosophy that we have, dealers know that selling current product is more profitable than non-current product."",
  ""And we're trying obviously for their benefit and our benefit and protecting the value of our brand, because the brand – Can-Am brand as a value is recognized for performance, quality, design, and we want to protect that."",
  ""Then, basically, that's why we believe that the strategy that we have is the right one."",
  ""When a season starts, it's normal to have a certain level of the non-current, which is happening right now."",
  ""But typically, after a quarter or two of the new season, the customer purchase is mainly current, and this is where we believe we will win big time."",
  ""Then, right now, we are into the transition of that inventory depletion period."",
  ""But we believe that mid to long-term, this will be very beneficial for us."",
  ""But at the end of the day, there is so many customers, and some who shop for a price could buy a Can-Am."",
  ""But if we don't have any non-current, he will buy another brand."",
  ""But again, we've been able to grow market share by the quality of our product, by the innovation with our product, the technology, and this is the bet that we take."",
  ""We push technology and innovation to attract more customers and gain share."",
  ""Then, we grew from 0% in 2010 to 20% last year – to 30% last year, and we still believe that we can continue to grow."",
  ""But we cannot... We cannot gain any or every customer who shop for a price."",
  ""This is not who we are."",
  ""Maybe if I could add a few elements."",
  ""Obviously, as José mentioned, we need to go through the snowmobile season."",
  ""From a big picture point of view, obviously, inflation and interest rates are moving in the right direction."",
  ""So, that obviously is good, but it may take an impact before we see an impact on overall consumer demand."",
  ""And so, our base case is that the powersport industry could be flat."",
  ""Obviously, some of you might say, well, you've done a good job this year of reducing inventory levels, and so will wholesale match retail next year?"",
  ""But there's still some OEMs that need to flush out some inventory."",
  ""And so, we expect the market dynamic to be challenging, especially in the first half of next year."",
  ""So, a bit of top line growth, a bit of benefit of wholesale matching retail."",
  ""But as José again indicated, PWC, snow inventory, we need to work through."",
  ""And in terms of overall profitability, obviously, we took some measures to right-size our costs this year."",
  ""So, that's certainly going to help OpEx as a percentage of revenue."",
  ""But there's some variable compensation elements, depreciation and financing costs that will offset some of that."",
  ""So, again, still a lot to go through, there was the trade situation as well that we're monitoring, but we will certainly be in a better position to provide you a detailed guidance in a few months."",
  ""Well, look, if you look at our historical track record, we've been quite active in terms of buyback."",
  ""The priority always remains investing in the business."",
  ""Certainly, we'll want to see how things trend in the start of next year, especially with the tariff situation, before we decide to be extremely active on buybacks."",
  ""We've always been cautious in managing the balance sheet diligently, and we'll continue to do so, but to prioritize returns is certainly a focus of ours as well."",
  ""Well, you're absolutely right that we were down 13% year-to-date in Q2."",
  ""And basically, that's all explained by snowmobile."",
  ""When I look at all of the other product lines versus Q2, all the product lines were down, and the one that's up obviously is snowmobile, because we've obviously shipped a lot of units in Q3 ahead of the peak retail season."",
  ""If there's anything, it's an improvement versus the position we were in Q2, and the overall objective of 15% to 20% still stands for the end of the year."",
  ""And as, again, we highlighted a few times already in the call, it's going to be largely driven by the snow season."",
  ""Well, two reasons, as I indicated."",
  ""I think the – well, the industry, there's still a lot of inventory from other OEMs and they need to work through their inventory."",
  ""So, we believe that dealers will be cautious in taking on more inventory and even work down further inventory."",
  ""So, that's the number one assumption, especially in the first half of next year."",
  ""And the other big one is personal watercraft and snowmobile."",
  ""There is going to be some inventory depletion happening next year."",
  ""So, yes, we'll see a lift on the top line, a modest lift on the top line, but we believe that dealers will remain cautious in the first half of next year."",
  ""And so, if we do see a bigger uplift in wholesale, it will be in the second half of next year."",
  ""And we ended Q3 in a good position."",
  ""Our non-current inventory in ORV is actually down about 30% year-over-year."",
  ""So, we're actually very happy with the position we have."",
  ""And obviously, as José indicated, we've got product news coming up, and having floor space to introduce that product news is also positive."",
  ""The year-over-year impact, don't forget, we are investing in EV and two-wheel this year."",
  ""So, the increment – and next year is still an investment year, because we'll invest – be investing marketing dollars in the launch."",
  ""So, it could be an incremental headwind of probably, let's say, CAD 20 million to CAD 30 million next year."",
  ""There hasn't been much change in the overall dealer count, Robin."",
  ""I mean, we add a few dealers here and there every quarter, but no big evolution."",
  ""So, the total dealers in the US as of yesterday was 982 dealers covering all the product lines."",
  ""Well, obviously, yeah, it has a big impact on the total operating expenses."",
  ""I mean, if we would have had Marine in our numbers, we'd probably be, let's say, 50 basis points higher in terms of OpEx percentage."",
  ""And as we look to next year, obviously, we're still investing in some product categories we've right-sized."",
  ""And so, we should see an improvement year-over-year in OpEx probably in the range of another 50 basis points year-over-year from 2025 to 2026."",
  ""We've never been a big sourcer out of China."",
  ""In fact, today, less than 10% of our sourcing comes from China, and the parts that we source are less technically complex."",
  ""So, in a situation where incremental tariffs could be imposed, obviously, there are parts that we could easily transfer to another supplier."",
  ""Obviously, it would require work."",
  ""I don't want to undermine it, but it's certainly something we could do."",
  ""And from a Mexico point of view, over 70% of our production stems out of Mexico."",
  ""But obviously, we're in Mexico, yes, for their cost advantage as we took the benefit of the various free trade agreements, but also for labor availability."",
  ""The workforce in Mexico is highly skilled, both from a blue collar and a professional point of view as well."",
  ""And so, we believe we will not be the same company had we not have that footprint in Mexico."",
  ""I would not have accepted to lose the same amount, that's fair."",
  ""Well, what we said, Martin, was that some non-current We do – every quarter, we do a deep-dive with our floor plan financing partners and do an assessment of the health of the dealers."",
  ""And generally, the dealers are in very good health."",
  ""They've made a lot of money during COVID, and so they're fairly well-capitalized."",
  ""We're supporting them tremendously with the inventory."",
  ""We're paying almost 70% of the floorplan cost financing."",
  ""And we've been diligent as well in managing deliveries this year and reducing inventory, which is certainly a plus for them."",
  ""Dealers are making obviously less money than they were making during the COVID."",
  ""But when you look at the overall dealer profitability and some of the metrics we could put our hands on, their profitability is somewhat in line with what they were making pre-COVID."",
  ""But nothing out of the ordinary."",
  ""No special provision, no risk of repo is on the radar."",
  ""Well, puts and takes, obviously, we're still operating with less than optimal levels of capacity utilization."",
  ""One big variable for next year is the programs."",
  ""This year, we did have to put more dollars on programs, hurting gross margin percentage."",
  ""The one positive element will obviously be programs."",
  ""Other positive element will be cost efficiencies that we're driving in the business."",
  ""And so, that would be the main one."",
  ""So, yes, expecting a slight improvement in gross margin next year."",
  ""One, we've recently launched two new ATV platforms, covering all of the segments – or 90% of the segments, and that's certainly been well-received and these are being sold as current units."",
  ""It's been over 10 years since we have introduced a brand-new platform like that."",
  ""So – and the industry has been relatively, if I could use the word, non-innovative, if that's the word."",
  ""And so, that's a big plus."",
  ""And on the ORV side, the side-by-side Maverick R four-seater certainly well-received and the Defender Cab current models are in high demand, and that's been fueling our retail growth."",
  ""Today, the assumption we have is the current interest rate environment."",
  ""Obviously, we believe that it'll take several cuts in order to move consumer demand."",
  ""Interest rates are still relatively high."",
  ""So, from a retail financing point of view, we need to see several cuts next year to start seeing an impact on demand."",
  ""But obviously, any rate cuts Well, obviously, every year, we challenge the teams on being more efficient and re-questioning the way they do their business."",
  ""Again, we expect a modest pipeline growth next year."",
  ""And so, most of the impact – I'd say probably 50/50 comes from operating leverage and the other one from cost efficiency."",
  ""There is two types of support we provide them."",
  ""We provide them with standard support when we ship a unit, which could be 60, 90 days."",
  ""And then, in a context where the industry is more challenging, seasonal business, we finish with more inventory, we'll provide them with what we call internally Yeah."",
  ""Well, that's all accrued for in the financials."",
  ""So, when we end the snowmobile season, we'll take the I wish I could, but I don't have the backup with me, Brian."",
  ""So, we'll have to take it offline."",
  "", Sylvie, and , everyone, for joining us this morning and for your interest in BRP."",
  ""We look forward to speaking with you again for our Q4 result on March 26."",
  "" again, everyone, and have a good day.""

  ""Despite sustained macroeconomic challenges and the charges recorded in Q3, we are encouraged by the sequential quarterly improvement in our core business profitability and by the results of our cost reduction efforts, which will be more fully realized beginning fourth quarter."",
  ""These improvements reflect our team's focus on managing controllables and reducing non-strategic costs in a difficult environment, while investing in impactful initiatives to expand our addressable market and growth opportunities, including our recently announced global licensing agreement with Margaritaville."",
  ""We're also encouraged by positive developments in the macroeconomic environment, such as cooling inflation and recent interest rate cuts in September and November, which should begin to increase demand for furnishings."",
  ""Our October High Point Market introductions were positively received with significant placements across the board."",
  ""In addition, we had the best retail placement market to date at outdoor furniture specialist, Sunset West."",
  ""The early feedback of three major casegoods collections for Hooker Branded gave us the confidence to place initial cuttings early before these groups were officially introduced in October."",
  ""As a result, the collections will ship this month, with a second cutting in January, increasing our speed to market by six months."",
  ""This puts us in a strong position for the coming fiscal year with our available product assortment."",
  ""In anticipation of increased demand and the typically stronger fall selling season, we built up Hooker Branded inventory by $11 million or 40% compared to previous quarter-end."",
  ""In addition, we are aggressively producing our top collections to ensure we will be in-stock during the first quarter of fiscal 2026."",
  ""These inventories are high-quality assortments centered on our best-selling and most profitable SKUs."",
  ""Now, I want to turn the discussion over to Paul, who will discuss highlights in each of our segments."",
  ""Over the last few months, the key economic indicators that impact furniture sales have been trending positively, such as interest rate cuts, which drive home mortgage rates and cooling inflation."",
  ""Additionally, in November, a leading real estate industry group stated its belief that the worst of the housing inventory shortage is ending, and forecasting approximately 10% increase in home sales for 2025, with mortgage rates stabilizing around 6%."",
  ""In October, year-over-year, furniture store sales rose for the second month in a row."",
  ""Lastly, consumer sentiment rose in November to its highest level since April, and the stock market continues near all-time highs."",
  ""While the macroeconomic outlook is improving, our team has continued to focus on the controllables and improvements already underway at Hooker Furnishings."",
  ""Our balance sheet, financial condition and management team should well equip us to navigate any remaining challenges as we focus on maximizing efficiencies with the cost reductions, while simultaneously investing in expansion strategies that will position us for revenue and profitability growth when demand fully returns."",
  ""This ends the formal part of our discussion."",
  ""And at this time, I will turn the call back over to our operator, Olivia, for questions."",
  ""Joining me this morning is Jeremy Hoff, our Chief Executive Officer."",
  ""We appreciate your participation today."",
  ""During our call, we may make forward-looking statements which are subject to risks and uncertainties."",
  ""A discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's expectations is contained in our press release and SEC filing announcing our fiscal 2025 third quarter results."",
  ""Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after today's call."",
  ""Our fiscal 2025 third quarter and nine-month results were adversely affected by the ongoing low demand in the home furnishings industry, as well as charges totaling about $7.5 million, including approximately $3.1 million of restructuring costs related to the company's previously announced cost savings plan, $2.4 million of bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy of a single large customer, and $2 million of non-cash impairment charges to certain trade names under the Home Meridian segment."",
  ""These factors resulted in an operating loss of $7.3 million and a consolidated net loss of $4.1 million or $0.39 per diluted share for the third quarter."",
  ""Consolidated net sales were $104 million, a decrease of $12.5 million or 10.7% compared to the same quarter of the previous year."",
  ""For the nine-month period, consolidated net sales were $293 million, a decrease of $43 million or 12.9% compared to the same period of the previous year."",
  ""This decrease was also due to low demand affecting the home furnishings industry and the absence of $11 million of liquidation sales from the unprofitable ACH product line, which the company exited last year."",
  ""The company reported a consolidated operating loss of $15 million and a net loss of $10.2 million or $0.97 per diluted share, attributed to lower overall sales, higher ocean freight costs at Hooker Branded, under-absorbed indirect costs at Domestic Upholstery, as well as the $7.5 million of charges mentioned earlier."",
  ""Now, I'll turn the call over to Jeremy to comment on our fiscal 2025 third quarter results."",
  ""Beginning with Hooker Branded, net sales decreased by $4 million or 10.7% in the fiscal third quarter compared to the prior year period, due primarily to lower average selling prices."",
  ""While gross revenue in the segment decreased by 6.7% compared to the previous year's third quarter, discounts increased by 390 basis points, due mainly to higher discounting on excess inventories."",
  ""Unit volume decreased by a modest 2.1% compared to the previous year's third quarter but exceeded the first and second quarters of this fiscal year."",
  ""For the quarter, the segment reported an operating loss of $1.7 million on historically low third quarter net sales."",
  ""The result – this result included approximately $1 million of severance charges related to our cost reduction plan."",
  ""Incoming orders decreased by 13% year-over-year."",
  ""The quarter-end backlog was 30% lower than at the end of the prior year's third quarter, but remained 18% higher than pre-pandemic levels, which were at the end of fiscal 2020 third quarter."",
  ""For the nine-month period, net sales decreased by $14 million or 11.7%, also due primarily to lower average selling prices resulting from the price reductions implemented in the previous year in response to reduced ocean freight costs."",
  ""Unit volume was essentially flat, decreasing by about 1% compared to the prior year nine-month period."",
  ""Turning to the Home Meridian segment, net sales decreased by $5.1 million or 11.8% in the third quarter compared to the prior-year third quarter due to reduced unit volume."",
  ""Over 40% of the sales decrease was attributable to the loss of a major customer following its bankruptcy."",
  ""Sales through major furniture chains and independent furniture stores decreased, though these decreases were partially offset by an 8% increase in sales in our hospitality business, marking two consecutive quarters of higher revenues."",
  ""Incoming orders increased by 8% compared to the previous year's third quarter, while decreasing modestly by 2.9% for the nine-month period, despite the absence of orders from the discontinued ACH product line and the large customer bankruptcy."",
  ""Quarter-end backlog was 32% higher than the prior year third quarter backlog."",
  ""Despite increased net sales – decreased net sales, Home Meridian achieved a gross margin of 20.5%, its highest level since the acquisition in 2016."",
  ""The restructuring efforts at Home Meridian over the recent years have shown meaningful results to experience sustainable profitability, including significantly reduced allowances, improved product margins and lower fixed costs across nearly all of this segment."",
  ""For the quarter, the segment reported operating loss of $3.7 million, driven by $2.4 million in bad debt charges due to the previously mentioned customer bankruptcy, $2 million in non-cash intangible asset impairment charges, and $233,000 of severance costs related to the cost reduction plans."",
  ""For the nine-month period, net sales decreased by $19 million or 16%, in large part, due to the absence of $11 million in ACH liquidation sales, which accounted for approximately 60% of the sales decrease and 75% of the unit volume decrease."",
  ""Sales decreased in nearly all channels during the period, except for the hospitality business, which experienced a 23% increase."",
  ""Lastly, the Domestic Upholstery segment."",
  ""net sales decreased by $3.2 million or 10% compared to the prior year third quarter due to decreased sales at Shenandoah, Bradington-Young and HF Custom attributable to the persistent low demand."",
  ""This decrease was partially offset by a 9% increase in sales at Sunset West, which has delivered year-over-year quarterly sales growth for three consecutive quarters this fiscal year."",
  ""Gross profit decreased due to lower net sales, but the gross margin remained stable."",
  ""For the quarter, the segment reported an operating loss of $281,000, a sequential improvement compared to the $1.3 million in operating losses recorded in each of the fiscal 2025 first and second quarters."",
  ""This result also included approximately $560,000 of severance costs related to the cost reduction plan."",
  ""Incoming orders decreased by 4.8% during the quarter, and the quarter-end backlog was 30% lower than the prior year third quarter backlog."",
  ""Excluding Sunset West, the order backlog remained consistent with pre-pandemic levels at the end of the fiscal 2020 third quarter."",
  ""For the nine-month period, net sales decreased by $10.6 million or 10.8%, also due to decreased sales at Bradington-Young, Shenandoah and HF Custom, partially offset by a 10% increase in Sunset West net sales."",
  ""Turning now to cash, inventories and capital, cash and cash equivalents were $20.4 million at the end of the third quarter, a decrease of $22.7 million from the previous year-end in January."",
  ""Inventory levels increased by $4.7 million from year-end, driven primarily by a $6 million increase in Hooker Branded inventories."",
  ""During the nine-month period, we used cash and cash equivalents on hand to fund $7.4 million of dividends, $2.8 million to further develop our cloud-based ERP system, and $2.7 million in capital expenditures."",
  ""In addition to our cash balance, we have an aggregate of $28.3 million available under our existing revolver at quarter-end, and – as well as $29 million in cash surrender value of company-owned life insurance."",
  ""We expect to finalize the refinancing of our credit facility and pay off our term debt in the coming days."",
  ""As Jeremy mentioned, we're aggressively building inventory to support three new major casegoods collections, as well as our best selling and most profitable SKUs to accelerate speed-to-market and product availability for both current and next fiscal year."",
  ""The inventory build is also driven by what is expected to be a longer than typical Lunar New Year holiday in Vietnam, an expected longer post-holiday ramp-up period resulting from the extended holiday, and lower production demand in Vietnam, as well as the potential US East Coast port strike in January 2025."",
  ""Earlier this week, we announced the payment of our regular quarterly dividend in December, which we believe demonstrates our confidence in the company's future success."",
  ""Now, I'll turn the conversation back to Jeremy for his outlook.""

  ""Oh, can you hear me now?"",
  ""So first, just curious, so since the election, have you guys seen any notable changes in demand from your customers?"",
  ""It seems like just talking to others in the industry, they talked about the election being a, certainly, distraction for the end consumer."",
  ""So, curious to get your thoughts on what you've seen so far."",
  ""That's good to hear, certainly encouraging."",
  ""And then, in terms of the three new casegoods collections, you talked about speed to market certainly driving that."",
  ""How impactful could that be for the fourth quarter as you look to get those products to retailers?"",
  ""That makes a lot of sense."",
  ""And you've done a nice job improving the gross margin at HMI."",
  ""Do you think you can further improve from here or what are your thoughts there, Jeremy?"",
  ""And as far as the inventory situation here, so you talked about having excess inventories."",
  ""Overall, your inventory was higher at the end of third quarter than we expected."",
  ""So, how would you describe your current inventory position and the quality of that inventory, and any sort of goal for your inventory at the end of your fiscal year?"",
  ""That makes a lot of sense."",
  ""And then, lastly for me before I pass it on to others, so Jeremy, I know you were very upbeat about the Margaritaville launch when you announced this, I believe, in October."",
  ""Can you provide any more details as to how impactful that deal could be for you guys?"",
  ""Well,  very much and best of luck."",
  ""Just wanted to ask my first question around the macro demand environment going into this holiday season."",
  ""Is there any potential to see continued discounting through the back part of this year?"",
  ""Just around the macro environment and the holiday season coming up, is there any potential for continued discounting as we go into the back quarter of the year?"",
  ""And then, just want to touch on the bankruptcy."",
  ""Are there any other customers that you're seeing as highly at risk?"",
  ""And is there any recourse to recover some of that write-off?"",
  ""And then, I did have another question around the licensing deal."",
  ""I was hoping you could speak a little more around the logistics and next steps and maybe what early wins would look like it."",
  ""It looks like this is a decent amount of white space for you all."",
  ""And then, just one last question from me, a two-parter around cost savings."",
  ""Should we expect any further severance costs in 4Q?"",
  ""And then, looking into the next year, should we expect the $10 million to be evenly spread out or would we expect that to be more backend-weighted as the cost – those cost savings ramp?"",
  "" That's all very helpful."",
  "" for taking my questions and good luck in the fourth quarter."",
  ""So, we've noticed a – we've had a noticeable positive bump in order rates since the election, for sure."",
  ""Well, it definitely gives us a better shot at some better shipments at Hooker Branded because we're going to ship first cutting in November, second cutting in January specifically to direct container customers that that will affect first."",
  ""But I think the more significant part of it is the fact that we're putting those collections in position for the next fiscal year to gain the full benefit of those hitting floors for the entire year and not half of the year."",
  ""I would say a little bit, and just to stress, most of that improvement was simply getting out of businesses we should not have been in, which obviously takes the average very positive compared to where we were when we had businesses losing money in a low margin business like the ACH business."",
  ""The fact that we're out of that, it's no longer a drag on the overall average."",
  ""So, that's been the biggest benefit for us."",
  ""But we do still think there's a little bit of room for improvement."",
  ""I would call our inventory position the best it's been probably, Paul, in probably two years."",
  ""And I say that not only because of the positive inventory we have on the Hooker Branded side that are some of our best SKUs, but not having the drag of something like ACH on the other side, which negatively impacts the entire inventory as well."",
  ""So, we really don't have the problem inventory within our system anymore like we did with the ACH."",
  ""We only – our increase is in really good SKUs."",
  ""Well, we believe it's going to be very impactful."",
  ""What's interesting about the Margaritaville license from our standpoint is it really affects a lot of our divisions."",
  ""It's not really just going to be a Hooker Branded thing, for example."",
  ""It's going to be Hooker Legacy."",
  ""It's – that's going to really affect positively, we believe, our contract divisions."",
  ""There's a lot of opportunity with hospitality and through H Contract that will give us an advantage with a lot of those jobs because Margaritaville is building a significant number of homes in areas that will be attached to in pricing those models and whatnot."",
  ""So, there's just – it opens a lot of doors that would not be opened otherwise."",
  ""Can you repeat that, Dave?"",
  ""There was a little bit of static or something on the line."",
  ""We don't believe any more than normal."",
  ""And that's what you're mentioning is the reason we're going to launch in October."",
  ""The temptation, of course, is to move faster than that and try to launch in April."",
  ""But ride is going to be much more important than fast for us and we want to get this right."",
  ""So, the logistics right now of everything are pulling that together from Sunset West, our outdoor company, is obviously heavily involved."",
  ""All of our Domestic Upholstery is involved."",
  ""Hooker Branded is involved, contracts involved, hospitality."",
  ""So right now, the biggest thing we're working on is pulling everything together the way it needs to be pulled together in order to make – to put our best foot forward on a launch."",
  ""So – and that that will continue until we get there."",
  ""I would like to thank everyone on the call for their interest in Hooker Furnishings and wish you all a happy holiday season."",
  ""We look forward to sharing our fiscal 2025 full year results in April next year."",
  ""We talked – I know [indiscernible (00:17:27) we talked about discounting excess inventories and building inventory."",
  ""And what we're doing is cleaning up the inventory, get rid of slow-moving stuff to free up the working capital to invest in better SKUs in the new products and in our bestselling SKUs."",
  ""Normal – yeah, normal promotions, e-com in particular."",
  ""We tend to run some specials, but it's targeted promotions."",
  ""Well, you probably know who that – the customer is."",
  ""And there's probably not a lot of recourse."",
  ""We've done what we can to mitigate that loss."",
  ""And that's really the only big customer that we – there's always a small customer here or there that's bankrupt."",
  ""We haven't really noticed a particularly significant change in the pace of bankruptcies or distressed receivables."",
  ""But that was one We don't expect significant additional – at this point anyway, we don't expect significant additional restructuring costs."",
  ""We've got one more element, one more reasonably large element of our cost savings program that we still need to execute."",
  ""But I would say that most of it's going to be in place for the better part of the year."",
  ""We haven't started really – we haven't fully realized a lot of those savings yet, but we expect to start seeing those in the fourth quarter."",
  ""And I would say that most of the $10 million will be evenly spread through next year.""

  "", operator, and  to everyone joining us today."",
  ""During today's call, I will provide a high level overview of our recent successes and strategic goals."",
  ""Then, I will turn the call over to Marshall Minor, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our third quarter 2024 financial results in further detail."",
  ""Following which we'll open the call to questions."",
  ""Throughout the quarter, we began to see the positive impact of our optimized cultivation and a successful launch of our Gramlin brand."",
  ""As we anticipated, our strategic initiatives have delivered real progress in the second half of the year, with sequential improvements in revenue, gross profit, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""Our Q3 2024 revenue increased to $32.6 million from $31.6 million in Q2."",
  ""Q3 gross profit increased 86% to $13.5 million, a 41% gross margin, compared with $7.2 million of gross profit and 23% gross margin in Q2."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit improved by 16% to $21.1 million, a 65% adjusted gross margin, compared with $18.2 million adjusted gross profit and a 57% adjusted gross margin in Q2."",
  ""Importantly, we returned to positive adjusted EBITDA in Q3 with $2.8 million of adjusted EBITDA versus a loss of $2 million in Q2."",
  ""While the first half of the year was impacted by the capital and operating investments that we made to bring our new flower rooms online, cultivation expenditures have stabilized."",
  ""We are now completing regular weekly harvest schedules and have more product available for sale."",
  ""Our focus remains on enhancing our operations to drive profitability by improving the efficiency of our existing infrastructure and fully capitalizing on our vertical integration."",
  ""Specifically, we achieved the highest value and consolidated margins by increasing the portion of our cultivated products that are funneled through our CPG pipeline."",
  ""Our completed cultivation investments have generated a 20% improvement in flower harvest yields compared to Q1 of this year, an important gain for both revenue and cost as every additional gram that we grow lowers our overall cost per pound."",
  ""The company is realizing economies of scale as we grow to full utilization of our installed capital base."",
  ""On top of increasing our cultivation yields, we've also built out our dedicated rosin production facilities, effectively tripling our production capacity for live rosin products."",
  ""This significant capability makes us one of the top rosin producers in California."",
  ""With rosin production now operating at high capacity utilization, we have driven down our cost of production per unit, allowing us to capture more margin while also providing customers with a superior product at an attractive and competitive price point."",
  ""We launched our first live rosin, a 1-gram all-in-one vape during the third quarter and subsequent to quarter-end, we've rolled out additional innovative products with positive market reception, including an innovative dual chamber live rosin vape offering a unique customer experience."",
  ""Market distinctive Gramlin rosin products are truly homegrown."",
  ""We produce the hash rosin oil from our own premium indoor flower, which we fresh freeze immediately after harvest and convert into premium live rosin all at the same facility."",
  ""Through the end of the year and into 2025, we plan to broaden our family of Gramlin branded products further, following the successful launch of its initial flower line in first quarter and vapes and pre-rolls in the second quarter, Gramlin has demonstrated incredible success amid a contracting marketplace."",
  ""While other brands are losing market share amid challenging conditions, Gramlin has experienced remarkable momentum."",
  ""Since its launch, both the brand and its product categories have consistently gained traction, steadily improving market position and showing impressive growth."",
  ""Currently, Gramlin is the 10th largest selling California brand and the number one fastest growing cannabis brand according to Headset sales tracking data."",
  ""Gramlin is currently available at all of our 16 retail stores and over 350 third-party retailers."",
  "" to our scale and infrastructure, we're able to offer its premium indoor grown products at a price point that few competitors can match, meeting the demand for quality, consistency and safety while maintaining strong value."",
  ""Our vertical integration makes this all possible and to support this growth further and also the expansion of Gramlin."",
  ""As we have previously shared, we have entered into agreements with Innovative Industrial Properties to lease an additional 53,000 square feet of cultivation canopy at two facilities."",
  ""These facilities are located near our Desert Hot Springs campus and will expand our cultivation footprint to 160,000 square feet of canopy and add approximately 25,000 pounds of new annual flower production."",
  ""These are operational turnkey facilities that will be delivered to us ready for use, allowing for us to meet the increasing demand for our products quickly."",
  ""The leases for these facilities will begin when we obtain all required state and local licenses, which we expect to happen in 2025."",
  ""As we move into 2025, our focus remains on further optimizing our cost base to increase our profitability."",
  ""By strategically refining our operations and realizing the full benefits of our expanded rosin capacity, we are positioning ourselves to grow our cultivation profitability, increase margins and evolve towards sustainable cash generation."",
  ""By leveraging the scale to maximize production, we will strengthen operating performance and drive increased EBITDA and cash flow."",
  ""In the quarter, we announced that we've entered into an agreement with J.J. Astor for $13.15 million loan facility and completed an initial draw of $7.51 million as well as the second $2 million draw last week."",
  ""Given the backdrop of the difficult capital raising environment in which the cannabis sector currently operates, we are proud to complete this capital infusion to help us continue to grow our CPG brand presence and market position, further enhancing profitability."",
  ""As we increase the revenue generated from our cultivation footprint, Gramlin has been a key driver of our growth."",
  ""As we plan to capitalize on that momentum with additional product launches, profitable growth to deliver sustainable cash flow remains our core objective, and we are confident that our efforts will position us for long-term success."",
  ""With everything we have accomplished to-date, we are well equipped to meet the growing demands of the market while achieving a top leadership position in California as a vertically scaled operator."",
  ""Now, I would like to turn the call over to Marshall, who will discuss the financial results of the quarter."",
  ""With our premium indoor cultivation, fully integrated operations, collection of 16 geographically strategic dispensaries and strong market share growth, we are increasingly distinguishing ourselves from our peer group in the California market."",
  ""Our strategic focus on building a fully equipped platform while maintaining high quality standards has enabled us to capitalize on recent market opportunities."",
  ""With full control over our entire value chain, we're maximizing every dollar of margin."",
  ""Our success is driven by sustainable long-term growth, supported by premium cultivation, impactful brands, economies of scale, and we're only just getting started."",
  ""With that, I would like to open the call to questions."",
  ""As a reminder, the results I will be going over today can be found in our financial statements and MD&A contained in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, and all figures discussed today are in US dollars."",
  ""It should be noted that all – that we are a US registrant with the SEC and as such, our financial statements are prepared on a US GAAP basis."",
  ""Revenue for the third quarter of 2024 was $32.6 million, a 3% increase compared to $31.6 million in Q2."",
  ""Revenue in Q3 was comprised of $24.4 million of retail revenue and $8.2 million of wholesale revenue."",
  ""The improvement in revenue was primarily results of increases in wholesale revenue due to increased sales to third-party dispensaries, driven by the launch of the Gramlin brand during Q2."",
  ""As Laurie mentioned earlier, Gramlin is currently ranked as a top 10 brand in overall retail sales in California, according to Headset."",
  ""Remarkable growth for a brand launched in late Q1."",
  ""Gross profit in Q3 2024 was $13.5 million, representing 41% gross margin compared to $7.2 million or 23% in Q2."",
  ""Adjusted gross profit for the third quarter, which excludes operating expenses related to US tax code 280E and depreciation and amortization adjustments was $21.1 million or 65% adjusted gross margin compared to $18.2 million or 57% for Q2 respectively."",
  ""Q3 net loss was $18.9 million compared to a net loss of $24 million in Q2."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for Q3 was approximately $2.8 million compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $2 million in Q2."",
  ""Both gross profit margin and adjusted EBITDA have been positively impacted this quarter to the increase of the first party brand sales, primarily from our Gramlin brand, as well as achieving cost reductions and efficiencies in cultivation."",
  ""We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $10.2 million as of September 30, 2024."",
  ""With that, I would like to turn the call back over to Laurie.""
]","[
  ""Congratulations on the positive adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""I'm curious if you expect this to continue and specifically, are there any seasonal factors we should think about moving forward that could impact this in future quarters?"",
  ""Any specific trends you're seeing, Marshall, on the flower side price in California?"",
  ""The second question is, it would be great to see you generating positive cash flow."",
  ""Do you see any catalysts that could get you back to breakeven or better cash flow over the next couple of quarters?"",
  ""Just wanted to stay on that theme with respect to some of the pricing trends that you've been seeing in the market."",
  ""I'm just curious, I know that other MSOs or I should say multi-state operators that predominantly don't have exposure to California are seeing much more of erosion in certain markets where the supply dynamic is a lot more volatile."",
  ""So, I'm just curious where that is in your local regions, in the state."",
  ""And if you think that there's sort of a steady – more of a steady state now that you're seeing in terms of overall price."",
  ""And then the other question I had is just more on within your own – within your own store economics, in your retail locations."",
  ""Does the introduction of Gramlin at all have any impact on your store margins?"",
  ""Like are you, I guess, another way of putting it, are you selling more of your vertical mix in the last six months compared to before?"",
  ""And just last one for me."",
  ""Maybe a question that no one really knows the answers too, but just on the back of the election, I know you talked about banking and obviously access to capital in the space has been challenge for everybody."",
  ""Do you have a view just obviously, politics aside, but just aligned potential Senate and House here and some of the appointees we've seen with respect to their stances on banking reform."",
  ""Is this something that means anything to you at this point or any commentary on that?"",
  ""Just because it's a question, obviously, as analysts, we get every day now."",
  "" for the questions, Laurie and Marshall."",
  ""So, the first one for me, just talking about the wholesale trends, nice growth in the quarter there."",
  ""Could you speak to the sequence of that growth maybe on a monthly basis?"",
  ""Could you see growth each month?"",
  ""And then if you could also just talk a little bit about the repurchase rates you're seeing from some of the third-party retailers."",
  ""I imagine there's some that are new to Gramlin as that brand has been ramping up, so to speak more towards the sequence of the growth and then the purchase rate that you're seeing in the early days from third-party retailers."",
  ""And are there any type of bottlenecks we should think about, maybe that would limit you from incremental growth, maybe as we're waiting for the additional facility to come online to get the license?"",
  ""Are you starting to reach, any level of capacity with existing?"",
  ""You saw a lot of room to grow as you're waiting for the license and to bring on that additional capacity, which obviously comes in 2025?"",
  ""I'll jump back in the queue."",
  ""Laurie, in terms of Gramlin, you have – you are top 10 now."",
  ""What can you aspire to with that brand?"",
  ""I mean, some of the brands that are number one to number nine are quite well established."",
  ""How much more inroads can you make there?"",
  ""And then related to that, if you can give more color in terms of how has it performing flower, pre-roll versus all-in-one vapes."",
  ""Look, and if I'm – when investors and analysts we look at comps, right, and people many times benchmark you against Glass House."",
  ""Sorry to ask the question, but Glass House, they talk about Allswell and their Glass House brand."",
  ""For those that are not so familiar with California landscape, how would you compare Gramlin versus the Glass House brands?"",
  ""And for Marshall, maybe just an update on the tax refunds that you've talked about from – I believe that you file for amended returns 2020 to 2022."",
  ""Remind us, what was the amount?"",
  ""When do you expect to get that refund and just confirm that for 2023 and 2024, you are filing as a normal corporation not applying 280E?"",
  ""So, I would say that it's really competitive at the retail side."",
  ""So in Consumer Packaged Goods, we've seen the retail side prices come down with promotions and such and the average basket size is down a little bit, but the number of units that people buying has increased."",
  ""So that tells me that consumers are trying to get a little bit more for their money given the economy and inflation."",
  ""So instead of buying maybe five – a pack of five pre-rolls, they may buy an individual pre-rolls."",
  ""So, we're monitoring that closely."",
  ""When you look at the full wholesale, which Marshall was referring to, I believe the reason, if you look today, back five years ago, there were approximately 18,000 cultivation licenses in California between annual and provisional."",
  ""Today, both those combined, there's about 4,500."",
  ""If you just look at the annual not provisional, it's probably 3,500."",
  ""So we've had a decrease of over 75% of cultivation licenses in California since inception."",
  ""And I think we're starting to see not just a bottom for both wholesale for indoor, but stabilization and some price increases."",
  ""So, I would say this we don't bet on college sports and we don't bet on politicians."",
  ""So, every time we think they're going to do something, they do something else."",
  ""But I will say over the last two days, we'll see where this goes."",
  ""But we've been pleasantly surprised by the appointment of HHS today and by the appointment of the Attorney General and by pleasantly surprised, both of those individuals have voted in favor of rescheduling cannabis and getting a very strong safer banking policy in place."",
  ""And I think this is going to be the first time that we're going into an administration where the Attorney General has confirmed is supportive of cannabis rescheduling and a strong safer banking policy."",
  ""And I think on the HHS side, with that meeting being moved, push there down to the DEA to get something across the finish line, I think just the consensus was that was up in the air."",
  ""So if he gets confirmed as well, I think it's all positive news and could potentially be nice tailwind going into 2025."",
  ""Yeah, we've got a goal to be in the top five, Yeah."",
  ""So the way that we look at products in California, we're very mature markets."",
  ""We have pretty much out, if you're looking at flower, outdoor flower, then you've got greenhouse flower and then you've got indoor flower."",
  ""So, Gramlin is for the indoor flower category."",
  ""It's some of the best quality for the best price and we deliver consistency."",
  ""The Allswell brand is going to be the same thing in that second tier, which is the greenhouse and that's what they're delivering over there."",
  ""So, we don't really compete on the shelf."",
  ""You're either going to go in and buy outdoor flower, you're going to buy greenhouse and you're going to buy indoor."",
  ""I think that's all we have."",
  ""We would like to thank everyone for the call today and  for joining."",
  ""We do continue to – we do believe that we'll continue to see positive growth in adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""From a seasonality perspective, we don't see much compared to kind of other competitors in the industry."",
  ""From our standpoint, you may see some softness at the end of the year, just natural from retail perspective, but not much."",
  ""For us, for indoor flower we've actually seen an increased pricing and demand for our indoor products over the last few months."",
  ""We'll continue to see – we expect to continue to see increased growth from – in revenue from the CPG growth of Gramlin, additional sales channels as well as additional product offerings within the Gramlin brand, as well as we did initiate some additional cost cutting measures in Q4."",
  ""We did do an approximate 10% reduction in payroll."",
  ""So, we are still monitoring other operational efficiencies, but it will increase cash flow from both revenue growth from CPG as well as additional cost savings initiatives."",
  ""Our first party exposure within our store is in within our 16 retail stores has increased tremendously."",
  ""I think at the beginning of the year, we were probably 20%."",
  ""Q2, we were mid-30s, we're kind of creeping up to that kind of 40% level."",
  ""So, we are seeing more of our products within the stores."",
  ""And that's because they're just the suite of products, it's vapes, flowers, pre-rolls, live rosin and we're launching edibles as well."",
  ""So we were kind of up and down the suite compared to the beginning of the year, we didn't have as many SKUs to offer our customers."",
  ""So each month is a strong month over month growth."",
  ""So each month we are seeing pretty significant stair step growth as each month progresses."",
  ""And that's from the standpoint of being in more doors and each month we're offering more products."",
  ""And we are seeing a very strong repurchase rates."",
  ""We've – I'll just give an anecdotal example, we sell to a chain of stores and they just order the vapes and then – the Gramlin vapes, and the next month they reorder the vapes and then flower and the pre-rolls."",
  ""And then now they're adding the live rosin all to the suite."",
  ""So more SKUs and then more doors is what we've continued to see on the retail side."",
  ""The existing – we still have an additional capacity in our existing facility."",
  ""So we – for both from the cultivation and manufacturing perspective that we are getting more efficient."",
  ""We can have some more throughput especially on the distillate and the live rosin side that's going to kind of drive some of the catalyst of the growth and the additional cultivation facility when that comes online will add some additional biomass for CPG, for Gramlin, both on the flower as well as the approval side."",
  ""So from 280E tax amendment perspective, we did file amended returns earlier this year."",
  ""We hope to get the refunds here over the next few months, if you kind of compare what's happened to other MSOs that have publicly announced their tax amendment."",
  ""So we're kind of following in the same vein, from a proximate from a size perspective, we hope to see somewhere between $10 million to $14 million of potential refunds."",
  ""And going forward, that is correct, but we're still filing as a normal""

  ""And , everyone, for joining us today."",
  ""Rubrik delivered another outstanding quarter."",
  ""We not only achieved very strong growth at scale, but also generated positive free cash flow."",
  ""We are incredibly proud to have surpassed $1 billion in Subscription ARR, growing 38% year-over-year."",
  ""And we did this in just over 10 years since Rubrik was founded, a big milestone for us."",
  ""This quarter once again, we have exceeded all top line and profitability guided metrics."",
  ""And more importantly, we are raising our outlook for the rest of the fiscal 2025."",
  ""There are the five key numbers that highlight yet another positive quarter for Rubrik."",
  ""First, and this is a record, we added $83 million in net new Subscription ARR, a clear indication that we are winning the cyber resilience market."",
  ""Second, our subscription revenue was over $221 million, growing 55% year-over-year."",
  ""Third, our Subscription ARR remained strong above 120%."",
  ""Fourth, customers with $100,000 or more in Subscription ARR reached 2,085, growing 32% year-over-year."",
  ""And finally on profitability, we once again made material improvement in subscription ARR contribution margin, up 1,100 basis points year-over-year."",
  ""On the cash generation front, we are very happy to report we had over $15 million in cash flow this quarter."",
  ""Once again, these results are only possible because Rubrik is winning the cyber resilience market."",
  ""Now, let's look at why we are winning."",
  ""Cyber resilience is the number one topic in cybersecurity."",
  ""There is a broad realization that cyberattacks and breaches are inevitable, and therefore organizations have to be resilient against such attacks."",
  ""Rubrik has a unique architecture and solution for cyber recovery and resilience."",
  ""This is what is powering our growth and market momentum."",
  ""Let me unpack this in three parts."",
  ""Number one, Rubrik delivered the fastest cyber recovery for our customers."",
  ""This is due to our unique AI-powered Zero Trust architecture."",
  ""Number two, Rubrik Security Cloud or RSC offers a differentiated single platform for automated data management and security control across all workloads, across enterprise, cloud and SaaS applications."",
  ""And number three, we are the only vendor in the market that combines fast cyber recovery with Data Security Posture Management or DSPM."",
  ""We believe DSPM plus cyber recovery is the only way to deliver complete cyber resilience."",
  ""In summary, enterprises are turning to Rubrik as their trusted cyber resilience partner because we can confidently meet their cyber recovery time objective or RTO."",
  ""Let's talk about how our focus on cyber resilience drove these strong results in the third quarter and how our investments in innovation are enabling us to deliver even greater value to our customers over the long run."",
  ""At the outset, Rubrik built a unique Zero Trust architecture that combines data and metadata from business applications."",
  ""This architecture allows us to apply AI and machine learning directly to the business data to provide customers with the visibility into the scope of the attack, the time of infection, the sensitivity of the impacted data, and the ability to do malware hunting and quarantining."",
  ""We deliver all these functionality natively, not with bolt-on security tools or third-party integrations."",
  ""This differentiated architecture enables us to uniquely pre-calculate clean recovery points, so that our customers can deliver the fastest cyber recovery time."",
  ""This transformed cyber recovery from a long drawn out affair with significant business disruption and loss to a simple and efficient recovery operation with minimal impact."",
  ""This is why we continue to win the vast majority of deals in competitive situations."",
  ""Let me give you a few examples."",
  ""This quarter, a global engineering and construction service provider selected Rubrik to protect its entire data ecosystem, including SaaS data protection for Microsoft 365."",
  ""This was driven by a board mandate seeking to consolidate multiple backup providers and improve cyber recovery time."",
  ""In a proof-of-concept with other new gen backup providers, Rubrik was the only vendor that beat their required RTO of less than 4 hours for their mission critical applications."",
  ""Another logo win was with the Fortune 20 healthcare company."",
  ""That selected Rubrik as their only cyber resilience partner."",
  ""After a thorough evaluation, we were the only immutable cyber resilience provider that could meet the organization's RTO, both on-premises as well as in the cloud."",
  ""In addition, adoption of RSC Enterprise Edition allowed this customer to rip and replace six disparate new gen and legacy backup vendors while delivering superior cybersecurity functionality."",
  ""And lastly, we had a win this quarter with symplr, a healthcare technology company, that provides access to systems critical to patient care across 5,000 hospitals and networks in the US."",
  ""Rubrik was selected over other new gen and legacy backup vendors due to our strong cyber resilience and cybersecurity capabilities."",
  ""Symplr CEO remarked, \""Downtime can be a matter of life and death in the healthcare industry."",
  ""Rubrik was the only vendor that met our security standards, met recovery objectives for our business, and demonstrated a commitment to continued innovation to combat modern adversaries.\"""",
  ""We continue to drive innovation to expand the reach of Rubrik Security Cloud platform."",
  ""We recently added PostgreSQL and Red Hat OpenShift Virtualization to our growing portfolio of hybrid cloud workload."",
  ""This expands our wallet share within enterprises that are transforming their hybrid cloud solutions."",
  ""Turning now to the success we are seeing in protecting public cloud and SaaS applications."",
  ""Enterprises are adopting Rubrik Cloud Protection for our simplified policy management across multiple cloud and SaaS workloads, our fast recovery time and our ability to drive immediate cost savings."",
  ""As more businesses move more workloads to public cloud infrastructure and adopt SaaS applications, Rubrik Cloud Protection becomes an even more essential component of enterprise security stack."",
  ""Let me highlight a few examples of new logos as well as expansion wins with Cloud Protection."",
  ""This quarter, a pharmaceutical giant selected Rubrik to protect its AWS cloud data estate after evaluating multiple new gen and legacy backup providers."",
  ""This customer consolidated disparate cloud native and legacy backup deployments into Rubrik's single platform."",
  ""This resulted in a 35% total cost of ownership savings for the customer compared to their prior backup solution for AWS, all while providing faster recovery times and superior cybersecurity features."",
  ""Another new logo is an Indian multinational company that selected Rubrik Cloud Native Protection for their Azure environment in Q3."",
  ""This company simplified its vendor landscape with Rubrik, replacing multiple legacy and Cloud Native backup providers."",
  ""This drove 40% hart cost savings compared to their prior deployment."",
  ""In a notable expansion deal, a top Japanese automaker selected Rubrik to protect its large and critical M365 environment."",
  ""After evaluating Rubrik against the legacy backup provider, this customer selected Rubrik for our superior security features and ease-of-use for the IT and security teams."",
  ""Now, moving on to Data Security Posture Management or DSPM."",
  ""DSPM provides visibility into sensitive data exposure to minimize surface area of attack and the risk of data exfiltration."",
  ""We are the only vendor in the market to offer DSPM plus cyber recovery in an integrated platform."",
  ""This allows us to deliver complete cyber resilience before, during and after an attack."",
  ""Our complete cyber resilience value proposition is resonating with customers as demonstrated by growing volume of DSPM deal, which nearly doubled quarter-on-quarter in Q3."",
  ""One example of a DSPM win, a large healthcare organization added DSPM and Rubrik Security Cloud Enterprise Edition for their enterprise workload to their existing Rubrik footprint, which was purchased just last quarter."",
  ""This customer displaced an existing DSPM vendor with Rubrik's solution, as we offered superior capabilities around managing sensitive data risk as well as the ability to deliver fast recovery in case of a cyberattack."",
  ""In addition, the adoption of GenAI applications such as M365 Copilot brings an urgency to DSPM adoption."",
  ""What makes Copilot such a powerful tool is its ability to leverage content across a company to provide accurate and relevant insight."",
  ""However, companies need to have the right data security controls in place to ensure sensitive data remains secure when using AI tools such as Copilot."",
  ""This quarter, we announced Rubrik DSPM for M365 Copilot."",
  ""This new set of capabilities not only helps enterprises reduce the risk of sensitive data exposure and exfiltration, but also helps them accelerate the secure adoption of Copilot."",
  ""Rubrik's powerful classification engine is designed to continuously and autonomously discover and classify all known and unknown data at a very rapid rate."",
  ""Rubrik DSPM for M365 Copilot is designed to ensure sensitive data is correctly classified, labelled and segmented, while ensuring right access permission."",
  ""This allows customers to leverage the power of Copilot while safeguarding sensitive data from the risk of exposure, all within our comprehensive Cyber Resilience platform."",
  ""Next, innovation is absolutely critical to building an enduring company."",
  ""So, let's talk about some of the big ideas that we are working on."",
  ""As some of you might have read in our IPO prospectus, Rubrik by design perpetually lives on the frontier of innovation and our long-term success depends upon our ability to continuously create and commercialize pioneering products."",
  ""In this vein, just this week at AWS re:Invent, we announced Rubrik Annapurna, which along with an exciting new partnership with AWS will accelerate the development of trusted GenAI applications."",
  ""There are three parts to this groundbreaking innovation."",
  ""Number one, Rubrik Annapurna API service will allow customers to have ready-to-go access to all business data to quickly build more powerful and trusted GenAI applications."",
  ""Number two, Annapurna will deliver secure data embedding powered by RSC."",
  ""And number three, Rubrik Annapurna leverages all enterprise data and metadata in RSC to easily set and manage data access controls for AI application."",
  ""We believe we are uniquely positioned to enable GenAI adoption in a secure and compliant manner, which is a top priority for enterprises."",
  ""We are excited about what we can do with Annapurna, because Rubrik extracts, manages and secures the most important real estate in the brave new world of GenAI business data."",
  ""However, I would like to note that we are in the very early innings of a multiyear strategy for Rubrik to be the secure data infrastructure platform for GenAI applications."",
  ""We look forward to providing more color on this roadmap as it advances in the next several years."",
  ""Now, let's discuss a few notable updates to our partnership across the security and data landscape, a key component of our go-to-market motion."",
  ""Our strategic partnerships focused first and foremost on creating more value for our joint customers through product integrations, so that 1 plus 1 equals more than 2 for our customers."",
  ""A few examples from Q3."",
  ""This quarter, Rubrik became the first data security platform vendor to integrate with Okta's Identity Threat Protection."",
  ""RSC provides visibility into user access to data and automatically monitors for changes to access permission to sensitive data."",
  ""The data context from RSC combined with threat context from other security tools allows Okta to orchestrate tailored response based on policy configuration and assist user risk level."",
  ""This integration helps companies manage risk around sensitive data access and respond to identity based threats and attacks faster and more effectively."",
  ""We also announced a new partnership with Pure Storage, joining forces to deliver a complete cyber resilience solution."",
  ""This partnership combines the strength of RSC with Pure Storage FlashArray and FlashBlade to deliver a secure approach to data protection across short term and long term storage needs."",
  ""As an example, Rubrik plus Pure FlashArray and FlashBlade can reduce backup windows from hours to minute and Rubrik allows Pure customers to find anomalies hunt for threat and discover sensitive data in their production environment."",
  ""Lastly, let me discuss business efficiency and profitability."",
  ""As discussed last quarter, we are focused on delivering leverage and profitability in our business model."",
  ""Our Q3 results demonstrate this commitment with Subscription ARR contribution margin up by over 1,100 basis points year-on-year."",
  ""We look forward to continued improvements based on our increasing scale, our focus on efficiency in the go-to-market and our disciplined investment for growth."",
  ""We are incredibly proud to have surpassed $1 billion in Subscription ARR with this level of growth and improving profitability."",
  "" very much to all Rubrikans for helping achieve this milestone and more importantly, for your relentless focus on innovation and creating the next horizon for Rubrik."",
  ""We are also very grateful to our customers, partners and investors for their continued support."",
  ""But let me be very clear, it is still very early days of the Rubrik story."",
  ""We are creating a new vision for the cybersecurity industry based on cyber resilience."",
  ""I'm personally even more excited today than I was at our founding in 2014 for what's ahead for Rubrik."",
  ""With that, I'm pleased to pass it over to our Chief Financial Officer, Kiran Choudary."",
  ""Welcome to Rubrik's Third Quarter Fiscal Year 2025 Financial Results Conference Call."",
  ""On the call with me today are Bipul Sinha, CEO, Chairman and Co-Founder of Rubrik and Kiran Choudary, Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at www.ir.rubrik.com."",
  ""Also on this page, you'll be able to find a slide deck with financial highlights that along with our , includes a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results."",
  ""These measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP."",
  ""During this call, we will make forward looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2025."",
  ""Our expectations regarding market trends, our market position, opportunities including with respect to generative AI, growth strategy, product initiatives and expectations regarding those initiatives and our go-to-market motions."",
  ""These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially."",
  ""These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC."",
  ""Rubrik assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today's call."",
  ""With that, I'll hand the call over to Bipul."",
  ""We posted outstanding results in the third quarter, and we exceeded our guidance across all metrics."",
  ""Q3 was highlighted by strong top line growth at scale due to our leadership in the growing market for cyber resilience, significant expansions within our existing customer base, and strong, continuous improvement in profitability."",
  ""Let me start by briefly recapping our third-quarter fiscal 2025 financial results and key operating metrics, and then I'll provide guidance for the fourth quarter and full-year fiscal 2025."",
  ""All comparisons, unless otherwise noted, are on a year-over-year basis."",
  ""Subscription ARR best illustrates the momentum of our business, and we are incredibly proud to have surpassed $1 billion in Q3, growing 38%."",
  ""We added $83 million in net new subscription ARR."",
  ""We continue to drive adoption of our Rubrik Security Cloud, which resulted in $769 million of Cloud ARR, up 69%."",
  ""Our Subscription ARR growth benefited approximately 2 percentage points from transitioning our declining maintenance base to subscription."",
  ""We have a differentiated land and expand model, where we have multiple avenues to acquire new customers and expand relationships with our customers after the initial contract."",
  ""We can expand through the growth of data and applications already secured by Rubrik through the expansion of our footprint of applications secured and/or by the addition of more security functionality."",
  ""As a result, we continue to see a strong subscription net retention rate, which remained over 120% in the third quarter."",
  ""All vectors of expansion are healthy contributors to our net retention rate, highlighting the meaningful runway we have to more deeply penetrate our customer base."",
  ""Adoption of additional security functionality remains at approximately one-third of our Subscription net retention rate, stable from last quarter, but up from approximately a quarter in the year-ago period."",
  ""We ended the third quarter with 2,085 customers with Subscription ARR of $100,000 or more, up 32%."",
  ""These larger customers now contribute 83% of our subscription ARR, up from 79% in the year-ago period, as we become an increasingly strategic partner to our enterprise customers."",
  ""For our third quarter and fiscal 2025, Subscription revenue was $222 million, up 55%."",
  ""Total revenue was $236 million, up 43%."",
  ""If you see revenue outperformance, relative to our guidance, reflects a strong ARR growth and higher than expected upfront and non-recurring revenue."",
  ""This is due to higher than expected new sales and renewals of RSC-Private from regulated and government verticals in Q3, as well as the extension of transition licenses to some of our customers, as they progress through their adoption of Rubrik Security Cloud."",
  ""Turning to the geographic mix of revenue."",
  ""Revenue from Americas grew 46% to $169 million."",
  ""Revenue from outside Americas grew 35% to $67 million."",
  ""Before turning to gross margins, expenses and profitability, I would like to note that I will be discussing non-GAAP results going forward."",
  ""We are committed to balancing strong growth at scale with improving profitability."",
  ""We are focused on delivering strong gross margins, improving our Subscription ARR contribution margin, and growing free cash flow."",
  ""We're achieving this, leveraging the benefits of scale, as well as improving efficiencies and management of cost across the business."",
  ""Our non-GAAP gross margin was 79% in the third quarter, compared to 80% in the year ago period."",
  ""Our gross margins continue to benefit from improved efficiency of our customer support organization, offset by continued investments in our cloud-hosting infrastructure."",
  ""We benefit from one-time cloud hosting As a reminder, we look at subscription ARR contribution margin as a key measure of operating leverage, supporting our path to profitability."",
  ""We believe the improvement in our Subscription ARR contribution margin demonstrates our ability to drive operating leverage and profitability at scale."",
  ""Subscription ARR contribution margin was negative 3% in the last 12 months ended October 31, compared to negative 14% in the year ago period, an improvement of over 1,100 basis points."",
  ""The improvement in Subscription ARR contribution margin was driven by a growing scale and continued focus on driving leverage across the organization."",
  ""In particular, our sales and marketing expense as a percentage of Subscription ARR moved down approximately 1,000 basis points year-on-year."",
  ""We expect to see further improvements in sales and marketing as we deliver on greater organizational efficiencies, improving cost of acquisition and a ramping renewal base."",
  ""Free cash flow was $15.6 million, compared to $3.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""This increase was driven by improved scale, operating leverage and working capital improvements, offset by a slightly higher mix of annual and monthly consumption payments and shorter contract terms relative to year ago period."",
  ""Turning to our outlook, we remain confident about the strength of the cyber resilience market and the demand for our differentiated offerings."",
  ""We believe these drivers, alongside our strong and consistent execution, will deliver strong Subscription ARR growth ahead."",
  ""Revenue and revenue growth can fluctuate due to a number of variables, including the pace at which we add new Rubrik Security Cloud customers or RSC and the pace at which we continue to migrate our existing customers to RSC."",
  ""In terms of operating expenses, we plan to continue to invest into this enormous opportunity ahead of us while delivering efficient growth at scale."",
  ""Now turning to guidance for the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2025."",
  ""In Q4, we expect revenue of $231.5 million to $233.5 million, up 32% to 33%."",
  ""We expect non-GAAP EPS of negative $0.41 to negative $0.37 based on approximately 187 million weighted average shares outstanding."",
  ""For the full year fiscal 2025, we are pleased to raise our guidance across both our top line and profitability metrics."",
  ""We now expect subscription ARR in the range of $1,057 million to $1,061 million, reflecting a year-over-year growth rate of approximately 35%."",
  ""We expect total revenue for the full year fiscal 2025 in the range of $860 million to $862 million, implying approximately 37% growth."",
  ""We expect non-GAAP Subscription ARR contribution margins between negative 3% and negative 2%, reflecting further margin improvement from Q3."",
  ""We expect non-GAAP EPS of negative $1.86 to negative $1.82 based on approximately 154 million weighted average shares outstanding for the full year."",
  ""We expect free cash flow of negative $45 million to negative $39 million or negative $22 million to negative $16 million, excluding the $23 million in one-time payroll tax associated with our IPO."",
  ""And finally, while we are still early in our planning for next year, I wanted to call out a few high level modeling points for fiscal 2026."",
  ""As a reminder, the benefit for Subscription ARR growth from the conversion of maintenance to subscription has been moderating and we saw approximately 2 points of benefit in Q3."",
  ""We are not expecting any benefit to growth from converting Maintenance to Subscription ARR in fiscal 2026."",
  ""In addition, historically, we see higher net new Subscription ARR in the second half of the year versus the first half."",
  ""As we have discussed previously, we had an exceptional start to fiscal 2025, which offset typical seasonality."",
  ""In fiscal 2026, we expect to see more normalized quarterly seasonality in Subscription ARR."",
  ""We have made strong progress in business efficiency so far this fiscal year and we also continue to stay focused on free cash flow generation."",
  ""Based on where we stand right now after completing the third quarter, we expect to deliver breakeven or better Subscription ARR contribution margin and modestly positive free cash flow for the fiscal year 2026."",
  ""We look forward to providing a fiscal year 2026 outlook on our Q4 fiscal 2025 ."",
  ""In closing, we are pleased with our performance in the third quarter and our higher outlook for the full year."",
  ""Looking forward, we believe we are well-positioned to continue to deliver efficient and durable growth given the large and growing opportunity for cyber resilience from our leadership, innovation and ability to execute on our vision."",
  ""We look forward to seeing many of you on the road in the coming months, including at the upcoming Barclays conference."",
  ""With that, we'd like to open up the call for any questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions here and congrats on reaching the billion dollars ARR mark."",
  ""Bipul, maybe just to start with you, in your prepared remarks, I thought you had some great examples of customer wins where cloud backup seemed like the main reason for the win."",
  ""And I think that some of us sometimes wonder what backup for cloud applications and cloud workloads look like, since the cloud presumably provides some sort of native backup."",
  ""So, maybe the question is, can you just talk about what you hear from customers about their desire to use third-party data protection tools like Rubrik for cloud workloads versus maybe relying on a backup solution from their cloud provider?"",
  ""There was a lot there, but does that make sense?"",
  ""That makes a ton of sense."",
  ""Kiran, maybe for my follow-up for you, the contribution margin here continues to improve and it was great to hear that, that can be breakeven next year and you correct me there if I am wrong."",
  ""But maybe the question is, how do you sort of think about that in terms of your pace of investments going into next year?"",
  ""And how long of a lag do you think Very helpful, guys."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""Kiran, you made an interesting point on the prepared remarks that I wanted to drill into with regards to DSPM deals doubling in volume sequentially."",
  ""I wanted to ask about how much of this is contributing to the pipeline and/or potentially shortening some of your deal cycles."",
  ""And then I have follow-up for Kiran, please."",
  ""And just on the free cash flow outlook, the preliminary outlook you shared for fiscal 2026."",
  ""Very much appreciate that color looking out."",
  ""But you did talk about some consumption-related headwinds that are starting to peek into the profile this year."",
  ""I'm wondering if you can give us a quick refresher on what some of the parts of the product portfolio are more tethered to the consumption modality, if you will, of pricing."",
  ""And how much of an impact that could potentially have as maybe sort of a headwind for next year to think about?"",
  ""Congratulations to the Rubrik team."",
  ""My question to you Bipul is and I have one for Kiran as well."",
  ""You've always maintained a view that the TAM for Rubrik in this cycle is not just a replacement of the legacy technology, but also participation of the broader budget pull available to you in cybersecurity, right."",
  ""I mean, that would make it a truly more sustainable growth company."",
  ""I'm wondering if you could point to any evidence in the quarter and evidence in the pipeline that you see that the TAM in cybersecurity, which is a vast – bigger pool of spending than the legacy business and how that is helping your business and are you able to participate in those new budgets?"",
  ""And also, Kiran, congratulations on the operating efficiency improvement."",
  ""How sustainable is this improvement that we saw going forward?"",
  ""I just wanted to ask a question."",
  ""So, coming back from the Wells Fargo TMT conference this week, I mean, it was really clear that Data Protection, DSPM and of course, Cyber Resilience, I think were top of mind for many organizations."",
  ""That really stood out to us as like the one key takeaway."",
  ""Based on the strong growth you're seeing in your Cloud ARR, I mean, it looks like you're seeing this too."",
  ""And I'm wondering if this inflection in demand for DSPM and Cyber Recovery is related to an inflection maybe in GenAI rollouts or is it something else?"",
  ""Just wondering if you could pinpoint what's driving this inflection."",
  ""And maybe as a follow-up to that, I think your Enterprise Edition gets about a 75% uplift over the Foundation Edition."",
  ""I'm wondering if you could just give us an update on maybe the adoption rate of the Enterprise Edition over the last six months since your IPO of how that's maybe changed and what you're seeing there?"",
  ""Keep up the good work."",
  "" so much and congrats on the strong execution."",
  ""The entire team has so much to be proud of."",
  ""Bipul, I wanted to start by asking you about Annapurna, the goddess of nourishment."",
  ""Can you talk about the vision and evolution leading up to this week's announcement?"",
  ""What we should expect in terms of availability across other cloud platforms?"",
  ""And is this something you expect to price and monetize implicitly or explicitly?"",
  ""Maybe a quick follow-up for Kiran."",
  ""You're clearly taking market share and it seems even more so in a quarter like this."",
  ""Is there anything that you can share with us in terms of win rates and where the share might be coming from?"",
  ""And Bipul, by the way, the Q&A, this is really helpful and really appreciate, Bipul, you answer to Kash's question."",
  ""He always asks good ones."",
  ""But we all get that from investors, like why is this going to last?"",
  ""That was really – that was clear as to why this – why you're not going to be Veritas in 1999, by the time 2000, I don't know But my question here is on partnerships."",
  ""You spoke about technology partnerships, but there's in – by the way, you need to have everything you're talking about, but one thing that really hasn't been hit on here is go-to-market."",
  ""So, can you talk a little bit more about go-to-market partnerships?"",
  ""We all know that you have a really strong go-to-market team."",
  ""But our field work indicates that you signed more VARs, we're just hearing more VARs and more reseller partnerships and that they wanted to partner with you and those that focus on security and they're already starting to see early traction."",
  ""This is the traditional way that enterprise security is sold."",
  ""So, can you talk a little bit about your efforts there and what – is what we're hearing right?"",
  ""And how should we think about go-to-market partnerships, that contribution going forward?"",
  ""And that all makes sense, Bipul."",
  ""But in the technology partnerships, they come out with big announcements."",
  ""And we look at those, and they're interesting, and we hear about them in the fields."",
  ""But are – is what I said happening?"",
  ""Like our – am I just like noticing it more or are more and more, and the first two you mentioned, VARs and GSIs, are there – is there a greater engagement over the last quarter or two than there has been, more part – are you signing more partnerships with VARs and GSIs or just, it's just something that I don't know, maybe it's been happening and I just didn't – I think I – we're trying to pay attention, but is it happening more?"",
  ""Well, keep it up, guys, because you know this, what we saw tonight is rare."",
  ""Rubrik has a huge opportunity in the cloud, and the reason is that cyber resilience is needed wherever your application and data resides."",
  ""But the fundamental question is that you have your data in three clouds, five SaaS applications and five data centers, and you can't have different method to do cyber recovery in different places because if you have to turn 30 knobs then you had a bad breach, you'll be down for a very long time."",
  ""So, customers are looking for a single policy engine and single security control to actually deliver cyber recovery across all of their data estates."",
  ""And that's why we are winning in the cloud, because we have a very comprehensive solution for all the native cloud providers, as well as data centers, as well as SaaS applications such as Salesforce and M365."",
  ""As an example, this quarter in Q3, a Fortune 500 insurance company came to us to actually replace their native backup solution on their cloud platform with Rubrik Cloud Native protection because they wanted the consolidated, again, policy management and security controls across all of their data, so that they can have a native data threat engine that would be provided for complete visibility control and being able to confidently do cyber recovery when the inevitable cyberattack happens."",
  ""Yes, Saket, and  for the question."",
  ""So, we are very pleased with the progression we have made in margin to date."",
  ""This quarter, we delivered minus 3% Subscription margin, which was almost 500 basis points better than the last quarter Q2, and 1,100-plus basis points year-over-year."",
  ""But really, the drivers of the progression and margin are twofold."",
  ""One is the top line scale and outperformance, but also the work we've been doing on efficiency, both across sales and marketing and R&D, in terms of the big investment areas for us."",
  ""And we look to improve that further based on the guidance we gave for Q4, finishing up this year."",
  ""And I did mention in my prepared remarks that based on where we are today after the third quarter, our goal is to be a Subscription ARR contribution margin breakeven or better next fiscal year."",
  ""So, that's how we are thinking about the goal is to build a profitable growth business here."",
  ""Now when it comes to the operating margin, we expect that to follow after Subscription margin."",
  ""Normally, I would think that to follow within a few quarters."",
  ""But just to remind everybody that we went through a cloud transformation, we're nearing the end of it, but that suppressed our revenue, under a top line accounting perspective for some time and because of that, the lag will be little longer."",
  ""But subscription ARR margin is the leading indicator for op margin over time."",
  ""Let me give you a little bit of a business color and then Kiran might add some more details."",
  ""In terms of like DSPM, we are continuing to see a strong traction with DSPM."",
  ""And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that number of customers doubled quarter-over-quarter in Q3."",
  ""The issue is DSPM provides data risk and data threat visibility and then combination of DSPM plus cyber recovery is the complete cyber resilience."",
  ""And since generative AI is now pulling data from the nooks and crannies of enterprise applications, [ph[ folks (00:36:06) need to understand the sensitivity of the content to be able to deliver responsible AI."",
  ""And that is also our attempt in terms of the Rubrik DSPM and Microsoft Copilot."",
  ""In fact, healthcare organization in Q3 added DSPM to their existing Rubrik footprint because their Chief Information and Digital Officer was concerned about their ability to recover quickly."",
  ""And they actually replaced their existing DSPM vendor to be able to offer superior cyber resilience capability and being able to understand the data risk, data threat, and to be able to deliver fast cyber recovery."",
  ""So, if you think about what Rubrik did to the backup and recovery industry, we transformed this market from backup and recovery for human error recovery or natural disaster recovery into a cyber disaster recovery platform."",
  ""We call it Cyber Recovery, Cyber Resilience."",
  ""And that has really expanded the TAM for this market, because to be able to deliver cyber resilience, you fundamentally assume that attacks are inevitable."",
  ""And if attacks are inevitable, then you have to think about what are you doing before actual attack happens, so how do you assess the risk."",
  ""Then during a legal, illegal activity run time, how do you assess the threat?"",
  ""And finally, if the breach has happened, then how do you deliver faster cyber recovery to be able to keep your applications up and running?"",
  ""And what Rubrik did was, all these three pieces Rubrik built into a single platform, Rubrik Security Cloud, which combines DSPM plus Cyber Recovery on a single platform."",
  ""And that's the unique architecture that we created from day one."",
  ""And it is not something that is bolt-on or you can pivot into."",
  ""This is inherent to our architecture."",
  ""And that platform is the unique solution in the market, where market is looking for a cyber resilient solution, not looking for a legacy backup Recovery solution."",
  ""So, if you look at our transaction, about half of our new customers adopt Enterprise Edition, which is the full Cyber Recovery solution in their first purchase."",
  ""And if you look at our NRR, about a third of our NRR comes from the cyber data security product attach that we are doing on our Rubrik Security Cloud platform."",
  ""So essentially, we have transformed this market from this legacy backup recovery approach to a Cyber Resilience platform, a Data Security platform, to make sure that folks can do cloud transformation, digital transformation confidently and keep their services up and running, even when confronted with an attack."",
  ""In terms of GenAI, GenAI is certainly a driver for lot of enterprise activities right now because GenAI is forcing people to focus on data, to understand the integrity of the data, to understand the sensitivity of the data, to understand potential risk of the data, to understand who has access to what data and what they can do with data."",
  ""So – and if you look at where we play Rubrik is the Data Security platform."",
  ""We, at the outset, our goal was to transform backup and recovery, which was a legacy platform into a Data Security platform to deliver Cyber Resilience."",
  ""And so, our DSPM plus Cyber Recovery together delivers our customers an understanding of data risk and delivers data integrity and availability."",
  ""And so truly, the GenAI initiatives bring the focus back into data and that definitely is a tailwind for this market."",
  ""Having said that, obviously digital transformation, cloud transformation, application – SaaS application adoption and everything that is accelerating throughout the years is also contributing."",
  ""So, it's a broad set of capabilities and broad set of market drivers driving the secular tailwind for this market."",
  ""So, Enterprise Edition continues to be the flagship platform for Cyber Recovery."",
  ""And we are also attaching DSPM to bring the security and threat perspective into it."",
  ""And we are continuing to see a strong adoption of Enterprise Edition."",
  ""About half of our new customers adopt – continue to adopt Enterprise Edition at the outset."",
  ""And as I mentioned before, nearly a third of our NRR is actually coming from the adoption of Data Security product, which includes a lot of Enterprise Edition Cyber Recovery plus DSPM offerings that we have."",
  ""This is a very important question for us."",
  ""Look, Rubrik is an ambitious company."",
  ""And from the outset, we had actually decided to make Rubrik a company that lives on the frontier of innovation."",
  ""And our goal is to build pioneering and commercially successful product to really do real transformation and perspective change at our customer."",
  ""And we want to build a long-term, long-lasting company, long-term profitable company."",
  ""And long-term companies cannot just focus on what is in front of them, but they create horizon, and that horizon is three to five years out, just like in the past, back in 2016 and 2017, we were working on Cyber Recovery and the set of capabilities that we've built then is finding success in the marketplace today."",
  ""So, we always think about what do we do today that three to five years out can change the game of the industry, can change the game of the market."",
  ""And Annapurna is a very important multiyear strategy for Rubrik because if you think about what Rubrik is, we are a centralized data platform with data security built into it, where we pull data for a multitude of enterprise application and create a common data, metadata format with data security built into it."",
  ""And as you know, GenAI is forcing businesses to extract data from multiple applications to be fed into the model."",
  ""And we have a ready-made next-gen data lake because we use this data lake to recover application, it's kind of like a reverse ETL back into the production applications."",
  ""We can use the same data infrastructure with data security built into it to deliver data into RAG or GenAI or whatever workflow they want to use to build powerful LLM apps."",
  ""But LLM apps that are clustered, that has security, that has responsible AI built into it."",
  ""Obviously, the secure data embedding that is powered by Rubrik Security Cloud and access control and all of that is inherent to our platform."",
  ""And our goal is, we've started with AWS Bedrock, but it is designed in an We will – actually, we'll do market experimentation, just like in the past four, five years ago, we did experimentation with the data security products."",
  ""We'll figure out messaging, product market fit, pricing, what price the customer would sustain, what value we are creating for them."",
  ""And as we make more progress on the path to monetization, packaging, pricing of Annapurna, we'll keep you updated in the next several years."",
  ""I mean, this is again, a long-term thing for Rubrik."",
  ""But this is a very exciting new area."",
  ""And we are working really hard at it."",
  ""Let me take this question, Kiran."",
  ""We continue to win vast majority of So, we have the full understanding of data risk, data threat and cyber recovery and architecture matters when it comes to data and data security and availability of applications."",
  ""And because of we build this architecture grounds up, when the customer sees our product, there is a reaction, positive reaction that happens."",
  ""And these products can't be like, you can't build this product by bolting on 30 different cybersecurity products or pivoting into cybersecurity."",
  ""This was a decision that we made day one where we said data, metadata and data threat engine is in a single platform."",
  ""We took a risky bet 10 years ago, but we were right in that risky bet."",
  ""And we are reaping the rewards of a unique architecture."",
  ""If you think about Rubrik's go-to-market strategy, we are a technology platform company with a multi-product that is sold on this platform."",
  ""And it is a global product."",
  ""We actually sell our product all around the world and then the routes to market is critical for us to have long term success."",
  ""So, we think about go-to-market, routes to market in multiple ways."",
  ""Number one is, as you mentioned, the VAR because we are 100% indirect business, we work with VAR and VARs take our product and attach some of their services to it to take us to their trusted customers."",
  ""The second motion is GSI partners, whether its global SIs or regional SIs, they again do, they operationalize Rubrik for their trusted customers."",
  ""If you look at, the third way is our technology alliance partners, from Zscaler to CrowdStrike to Pure Storage to Cisco, we work with all of them to actually take our product to market."",
  ""And we have a co-engineered solution with these technology partners, we are 1 plus 1 is more than 2."",
  ""So, that end customers see bigger value from Rubrik partnership with, for example, Zscaler, where we provide the Zscaler customers full visibility into the threat of a data passing over the network."",
  ""And that value is again one product alone can't deliver."",
  ""And this is where we are actually creating this multifaceted go-to-market strategy to comprehensively deliver Cyber Resilience Solution around the world, across whatever trusted advisor partner products that our customers have."",
  ""It is definitely happening more, but it has been happening for last many quarters."",
  ""Because what has happened is that in the last couple of years, the customers are demanding for Cyber Resilient Solution, Cyber Resiliency."",
  ""They are asking for how do I keep my services up and running even when I'm breached?"",
  ""Even – how do I keep my hospitals up and take patient even when it is breached?"",
  ""How does kids go to school when the school is breached?"",
  ""And when the GSIs and VAR hear this question, they're not thinking about backup and recovery."",
  ""They are saying that how do I bring a complete Cyber Resilience Solution and protect our customers?"",
  ""And it is going to take two to the VARs and GSI."",
  ""One is, they are not having a discussion around infrastructure and dollar per terabyte."",
  ""They are having a strategic dialogue with the customer around risk and risk mitigation."",
  ""And then the second thing is that it actually broadens their scope in the enterprise from just infrastructure into infrastructure plus cybersecurity."",
  ""So, you really noticed it right, large GSIs, large VARs and many VARs and many GSIs are taking Rubrik to market because their success with their end customer depends upon their ability to drive cyber resiliency."",
  ""And that's why you are noticing more and more folks are signing up with Rubrik."",
  ""In closing, I would like to thank all our customers, all our partners, all our Rubrikons, as well as all our investors for your continued support."",
  ""These are still very early days of Rubrik because company's life is in decades, not in years."",
  ""And we just finished the first decade of Rubrik and has entered the next decade."",
  ""We want to build a long-term large profitable business, and we look forward to working closely with you to learn from you to understand where the market is moving, and how do we continue to build market-defining products to keep our customers secure and make sure that they can do this transformation confidently."",
  ""I think, Fatima, just to add – I think on your sales cycles question, DSPM is still a relatively smaller part of our business."",
  ""So, it's not influencing our overall sales cycles, which have been stable this year."",
  ""So, So, we have seen over the past several quarters a bit of a shortening on contract cycles as well as invoice cycles."",
  ""And that is what I've referred to as modest headwinds to free cash flow through this year as well."",
  ""And as we think about next year, we're not giving guidance or an outlook yet."",
  ""We'll do that after our Q4 call."",
  ""But in regards to the comment on cash flow positive as a modeling point, we'll expect some further modest compression as well."",
  ""And Kash, just to answer your – the second question you had on operating efficiency."",
  ""So, we are really pleased with the progress we've had over the past several quarters, both in terms of Subscription ARR contribution margin as well as cash margins."",
  ""If you look at the drivers for them, in terms of the big investment areas, sales and marketing and R&D, we expect many of these drivers to continue, including the ability to drive higher productivity from multiple products."",
  ""Our focus on enabling the sales on go-to-market teams and lowering the cost of acquisition with targeted marketing as well as more partner leverage."",
  ""And I would say that renewals is still a minority of our business and we expect that to grow in contribution."",
  ""And with that, we get natural leverage as well."",
  ""On R&D, we continue to hire talent globally with a particular focus on our India center, where we have hired great talent over the past years and we expect that to continue as well."",
  ""So, many of these drivers, we will see it continuing, but of course, they will moderate over time in terms of the improvements we see.""

  ""Just to get We would have all seen that, especially in Jamaica, we would have been significantly impacted by Hurricane Beryl."",
  ""We would have seen the economy start to slow somewhat from – when we a slowdown in the tourism sector in Q1 of the year."",
  ""And that was mainly due to a travel advisory which was issued by the – in early January."",
  ""That has slowed the economy somewhat."",
  ""The projections for the economy going forward are for the probably Jamaican economy to either move into negative territory for the year."",
  ""We see that impacting businesses across the productive sector, the financial services in terms of impact on profitability and therefore, it creates a environment that it would welcome further monetary policy ease and interest rates reduction so that we can look to stimulate growth in our economy, right?"",
  ""So that is an overall context."",
  ""In the Dominican Republic, we have seen interest rates being reduced also."",
  ""However, liquidity continues to be tight."",
  ""Interest rate continues to be tight as the – in the Dominican Republic, Central Bank would be managing for exchange rates stability and therefore, managing liquidity accordingly."",
  ""Therefore, in the – just to give a little bit more specifics around that, the Bank of Jamaica would have cut rates down to 6.5% coming from a 7%."",
  ""The Fed, the US Fed would have reduced rates in September by 50 basis points, down to the 4.75% to 5%."",
  ""In the Dominican Republic, interest rates would have been reduced to 6.25%."",
  ""So moving in the right direction, however, this is on the back of 18 months of rate hikes from 2022 through 2024, 18 to 24 months of rate hikes and tight monetary policy across the globe and especially in Jamaica and the Dominican Republic, where our operations reside."",
  ""And Trinidad, which was not as heavily impacted, so therefore, as we go forward we expect to see our core business settle down and look to see improving group operating revenues going forward."",
  ""We have also been impacted by the variability in our earnings from the share of profits of associates."",
  ""And we saw that in Q1 where there was the Sagicor Financial Group would have taken a hit in terms of their market experience losses, which would have impacted the share of profits, which would have contributed to JMMB making overall loss of negative JMD 1.4 billion in Q1."",
  ""We're happy to see that in Q2 that we would have rebounded, we see group operating revenues stabilizing, and we're hoping to move that in the right direction going forward."",
  ""Not we're hoping, we are moving it in the right direction going forward."",
  ""However, in Q2, we would have seen a profitability of JMD 2.2 billion in Q2 driven significantly by the SFC earnings."",
  ""And therefore, a year-to-date we would have moved back into positive territory from negative territory in Q1 and back into positive territory with a profitability of about JMD 696 million for the six months ending Q2."",
  ""So, the trajectory is moving in the right direction."",
  ""We also have to get under control our operating expenses as we go forward and ensure that our group operating revenues are growing faster than our operating expenses."",
  ""A lot of work has been taken place in this regard to ensure that we can move the business forward in a positive group operations, our group operations in a positive territory."",
  ""We know that it would be the focus of analyst and the discerning investor."",
  ""What is JMMB's core operations doing?"",
  ""And we are very much focused around that to ensure that our core operations move in the right direction and we are also managing for the variability in terms of the earnings from share profits from associates."",
  ""That would be the my context."",
  ""Welcome to Trinidad and Tobago, everyone."",
  ""We are truly proud to highlight that T&T would have successfully executed the expansion of our branch network, which is very much aligned to our strategic goal of client success."",
  ""Our JMMB Express Finance team launched a sixth branch in Trinidad on 26th of September in an area known as San Juan, a bustling and vibrant community along our East West corridor."",
  ""The location is ideal to serve the people of San Juan environs, and we are really excited about how we can contribute to the growth of the area."",
  ""The branch has been well-received by the community and is already recording strong numbers, making an excellent contribution to the performance of our Express Finance team who are already exceeding targets and expectations year-over-year."",
  ""So, we look forward to great things from that new location."",
  ""In addition, our JMMB Bank launched its fifth branch in Trinidad on the 9th of September in the community of Princes Town, which is in the south of the island."",
  ""This community is a very important one in South Trinidad is a bustling hub of commercial and retail activity."",
  ""The branch location represents the first sales agency for JMMB Trinidad, which leverages digital solutions to meet the needs of our clients."",
  ""This branch has also been well received and has surpassed all of its monthly targets since opening."",
  ""We strongly believe JMMB Bank will make a positive impact in this location and we expect to be an instrumental factor in the growth of that community."",
  ""I will close by saying that we are extremely excited about what the future holds for JMMB in Trinidad and Tobago."",
  ""I now hand you back over to Kerry-Ann."",
  "", Kerry and Patrick  for giving me the room to talk about expenses."",
  ""So just overall summary, diversification continues to work well for us."",
  ""Our banking business line continues to perform."",
  ""Our investment business line, which was impacted across all three territories in terms of the profitability of our three investment operations, which happened to be JMMB's flagship and foundation business have been impacted significantly by the monetary policy environment, which has impacted our revenues, which has impacted our profitability."",
  ""However, our banking business line, has stood up and been very resilient and continues to perform."",
  ""From a country perspective and diversification, Dominican Republic and Trinidad continue to perform."",
  ""So therefore, diversification as a strategy, just to reinforce, has been working for us from a business line perspective and from a country perspective."",
  ""When we look at our strategic investment in SFC, Sagicor Financial Corporation (sic) [Company] (00:28:03), where we are the largest shareholder when the shares of – shareholdings of over 23%."",
  ""Whilst the earnings have been volatile since the adoption of IFRS 17, they continue to perform and their future is – we are very, very optimistic about the future of the Sagicor Financial Corporation (sic) [Company] (00:28:29), especially as they have been able to now look to consolidate their North American operations with Ivari, since the acquisition of Ivari Insurance Company in Canada and Sagicor USA, moving in the right direction and their Caribbean operations continue to be solid."",
  ""So therefore, across countries we have diversification across business lines, we have diversification and we have a significant strategic investment, which continue to give us, deliver overall profits to the group."",
  ""But from a JMMB core operations perspective, as we go forward, we have to ensure that we are managing and ensuring that we grow our revenues, core operating revenues, faster than we are going to expenses."",
  ""As our CFO pointed out earlier, we made significant investments in – through capital expenditure to build out the capability of the group with over 80 platforms, with – digital platforms and with our financial platforms, et cetera."",
  ""Those investments were made upon which we can scale and those investment that we have – the capital expenditure investments would have been significant and therefore, we expect to get the returns from those investments going into the future."",
  ""Those investments that get depreciated and then you will see in our expense line that those expenses increase and our IT cost over the years."",
  ""We also have to be very much focused around, as I said, cost management and therefore, cost management means that we cannot allow the cost to outrun the revenues because we know the revenue streams have disappeared, for example, through the margin compression not disappeared, but been significantly reduced through net interest income being reduced through gain on securities traded because they are in a unfavorable monetary policy environment."",
  ""There is not a lot of trading opportunities."",
  ""We see it in equities market in Jamaica and in Trinidad."",
  ""So, therefore, we have to control our costs and ensure that we are growing our revenues even faster than our expenses."",
  ""We are monitoring that quarter-over-quarter, month-over-month, daily active monitoring of our operating expenses as we must keep them in line."",
  ""We expect, going forward that the business environment will continue to improve as interest rates are reduced and continue to be reduced."",
  ""We expect that the Bank of Jamaica, this week, will look to probably make another 25-basis-point cut."",
  ""We would hope for more, but we expect at least a minimum of 25 basis points on the heels of the US Fed, Federal Reserve cutting interest rates last week."",
  ""And we are hoping for the same to occur in the Dominican Republic, where interest rates have come down to 6.25%."",
  ""So, all-in-all, going forward, we're managing core operations to increase the profitability, continue on a positive trajectory with our group operating revenue net of our group operating expenses and continue to build out on specific initiatives around growing, which we call We are ensuring that we're driving an optimal funding mix across the group, off balance sheet and funds and a deposit mix in terms of encouraging more savings products and more transactional products through our easy access deposit product and therefore, offering a diversification of investment solutions and deposit solutions on the liability side and the funding side to ensure that we are optimizing our funding mix."",
  ""While in terms of as we go forward, we have to ensure that we are putting on high quality assets and we have been able to do so in the growth of our loan portfolio."",
  ""We see that because with our non-performing loans and the kind of figures and the provision that we have to do in relationship to our core loan portfolio has been well within industry."",
  ""So, we continue to manage that very well."",
  ""So, all-in-all, we have a lot of work to do in terms of as we go forward."",
  ""We have to have active management and growing those revenues at our core business."",
  ""We have to manage our expenses in a relationship to those core revenues."",
  ""So, we are optimistic for the future."",
  ""It won't be that things are going to change overnight."",
  ""We expect that this will be a process, but we expect that we'd continue to deliver profitability to the group and our shareholders, as we go forward."",
  ""My name is Kerry-Ann Stimpson and I'm the Group Chief Marketing Officer for JMMB Group."",
  ""Welcoming you to another one of our quarterly investor briefings."",
  ""And this is an opportunity that we use every single quarter in addition to our annual general meeting to not only give you an update on what's going on with our organization, our strategies, our progress, our developments, but specifically to time it with the disclosure of our financial statements."",
  ""And of course, the 30th of September would have been the end of our six-month period."",
  ""Our financial year runs April 1 to March 31 and so the end of September would have been the end of our six-month period and we would have disclosed our financial performance for that six-month period to the markets last week."",
  ""And so here we are to have a conversation to discuss those results to share with you the highlights from the information that was presented, and of course, to give you some insights into what's going on and what to expect regarding our strategic progress."",
  ""So we're very happy, again, to be here with you."",
  ""We're joining you live via Zoom as well as YouTube on the World Wide Web."",
  ""So  so much for joining us."",
  ""And of course, we will take you through this morning's proceedings as we have an interesting conversation."",
  ""So of course, I am joined here in studio."",
  ""I'm plant as usual by two of our executives, our Group CEO, Mr. Keith Duncan here to my left; and of course, our Group CFO, Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Patrick Ellis to my right."",
  ""And of course, we are supported by another well – some more members of our leadership team who will be coming in various points during the presentation to share their updates."",
  ""And of course, once we have finished with the presentation, then we will open the floor to any questions that may be posed."",
  ""So without further ado, we're going to kick things off as usual in usual style with our group CEO, Mr. Keith Duncan, who is going to share with us the context ahead of this morning's presentation."",
  ""Moving in the right direction,  for that."",
  ""And, of course, now we hand over to Mr. Patrick Ellis, who is our Chief Financial Officer for the group."",
  ""And I call him the man with the numbers."",
  ""And he's going to take us through the highlights from the financial results for the six-month period."",
  "", Kerry and  again Keith for setting the context and giving the global picture in terms of the macro environment that we are operating in, which, some with somewhat is reflected in our numbers."",
  ""For year-to-date Q2, we would have reflected earnings of JMD 696 million."",
  ""The group recovering as our CEO indicated from a Q1 loss were SFC, Sagicor Financial Company would have impacted our numbers somewhat, however, we would have reflected a recovery there."",
  ""In terms of our overall revenue, JMD 11.4 billion, down JMD 1.2 billion, mainly driven by the macro environment."",
  ""You would have seen our gains on securities trading would have fallen off somewhat from JMD 3.3 billion to JMD 2.5 billion."",
  ""However, this is as a result of the high interest rate environment and therefore the trading opportunities within our investment business line would not be as robust as in prior years."",
  ""However, the team was able to garner JMD 2.5 billion in trading earnings, and that for us is very important."",
  ""Our NII, as the environment, the interest rate, we see that relaxing."",
  ""We would have – the initiatives from our cost of funds management would have borne fruit."",
  ""We saw an improvement of approximately 1% there."",
  ""Our NII would have been positively impacted growing by JMD 235 million year-over-year from JMD 5 billion to JMD 5.3 billion."",
  ""So, we are definitely moving in the right direction where that is In terms of our other revenues, we would have seen our off-balance sheet products."",
  ""As we continue, one of our focus is our Smart Growth."",
  ""And In terms of part of our diversification strategy, you would have seen that SFC would have recovered from it's – our Q1 where we actually reflected the share of loss of JMD 1.4 billion."",
  ""In Q2, we had delivered JMD 2.1 billion, the somewhat new standard that is driving the insurance industry, the IFRS 17 would have seen the valuation of its assets and liabilities using different discount rates for the assets and liabilities would have created some volatility."",
  ""That's something I know from an industry standpoint they're working through."",
  ""But we are pleased we think we're are moving in the right direction."",
  ""Their core operation generated $24 million in core earnings and that investment continues to garner a lot of fruit for us, JMD 896 million in dividends year-to-date."",
  ""And so we think that from a diversification standpoint, complementing from our other suite of products investment and banking and On the expense side, very important, our CEO indicated our strategic initiatives in this regard."",
  ""We would have started from the prior financial year."",
  ""You would have seen the VSP initiative that we would have done."",
  ""We continue to see positive impact in this regard."",
  ""When you look at our overall staff cost is basically flat year-over-year in an environment where we would have positively paid out at least 5% in terms of inflation and we are below that at approximately 2% growth."",
  ""Our other operating expenses is where a number of our initiatives we need – we are working through currently."",
  ""In terms of you would have seen our CapEx costs coming on stream on the business from our investment in our digitization and our standardization."",
  ""Our IT costs, which is a lot of that cost is US denominated and therefore, with a devaluation on our currency would have impacted us."",
  ""But with our various initiatives in terms of our From an asset standpoint we are focused around our core initiatives."",
  ""The growth on our balance sheet would have mainly been driven on the loan side, which is the banking business line, which is where we want to grow."",
  ""Funding mainly by our deposit – sorry loans would have been growing by approximately JMD 10 billion, standing at JMD 209 million at the end of Q2, funding, mainly by our deposit of JMD 216 billion, which showed 8% growth at JMD 16 billion."",
  ""On our investment side of the book, the investment business line, as we had indicated in previous investor sessions, that you're going to see a tapering on this line."",
  ""Some of that growth of 3%, mainly driven by inflationary but funded by repo."",
  ""So, as we Just in terms of highlighting our diversification strategy, Jamaica continues to be our flagship and contributing 54%, or JMD 13.9 billion in terms of revenue."",
  ""Dominican Republic up by 1% at JMD 5.5 billion, Trinidad up by 2%, JMD 4.3 billion Just taking another look at our diversification strategy by business line in terms of banking and financial services, our banking continue to be our focus 68.7% or JMD 7.8 billion compared to the financial services at JMD 3.1 billion, which would have been impacted by the high interest rate environment."",
  ""But that's what a good, strong diversification strategy does for your – not just by regionally but also by business lines."",
  ""From a capital standpoint, the group's capital continue to be very strong, growing by approximately JMD 3 billion since the financial year end at approximately JMD 57.9 billion at end of Q2."",
  ""We would have seen some recovery in terms of asset prices in our fair value reserve And that just ends my bit at this time."",
  ""I would also just speaking on the cause of the strong capital base."",
  ""We would have done our annual review with CariCRIS, which there reaffirm our ratings regionally BBB+ on foreign currency side, and locally AA-."",
  ""So the group continues the confidence in terms of the – from our regulatory environment and from our rating agencies."",
  ""CariCRIS are saying a stable outlook, but they also reaffirmed a rating for the group which just confirms in terms of the stable capital base that we are on and the trajectory that we're on."",
  ""With that, I'll hand over to you, Kerry."",
  "" so much, Patrick, as always, giving us that very detailed overview of what the numbers would have looked like for the period and of course, continuing to be happy to share about our solid performance and our resilience as an organization and great way to end the presentation, highlighting that reaffirmation by CariCRIS."",
  ""So of course, we always like to include in our investor briefing highlights of special things that would have happened through the quarter."",
  ""And special things, meanings, it's special developments, I should say."",
  ""And right now I'd like to hop over."",
  ""We're going to take a short hop to Trinidad and Tobago via Zoom, where we will be joined by our very own Shawn Moses."",
  ""Shawn is the country head for JMMB's operations in Trinidad and Tobago."",
  ""He's also the CEO of JMMB Bank."",
  ""And he has some interesting news to share about what took place in that market certainly over the last quarter."",
  "" and congratulations to you and your team for your continued success and growth in Trinidad and Tobago."",
  ""And our next highlight, I actually am just going to jump in and share it because it would have been shared by our very own Gifford Rankine."",
  ""I know most folks who are in touch with JMMB know Gifford."",
  ""He's our General Manager of Digital Services and probably one of the hardest working folks in recent months, because we've really been doing a lot in this space by way of digital transformation."",
  ""Most folks would have remembered that we launched the JMMB Moneyline app earlier this year to huge acclaim."",
  ""And what would have happened certainly in the last quarter is that we rolled out what we call internally to be online onboarding."",
  ""For some folks, they would call it online account opening, but quite simply, you can now open your JMMB account, most of your JMMB accounts online, that is banking and even your unit trust accounts and your brokerage accounts, equity money market accounts, your So right now we have seen certainly since the rollout in September, very, very positive response through online onboarding or online account opening."",
  ""We see where our clients now have the ease and the convenience to open accounts online."",
  ""So wherever they are, we know that not everybody likes to come into our branch and that's fine with us."",
  ""You can now go online via our website and use the opportunity to open your JMMB accounts online."",
  ""What we would have seen is significant adoption and increasing usage of that service."",
  ""I mean, in the first month alone, 78% of the accounts opened in the group in Jamaica would have been opened via the online account opening portal."",
  ""So already a very, very positive response."",
  ""We expect to see that number increase as the months go by and as more individuals adapt to the solution."",
  ""And this, of course, would have taken place in Jamaica."",
  ""The expectation is as we get regulatory approval, we will roll it out across our other countries, especially in Trinidad and Tobago and the Dominican Republic for now."",
  ""So we are very, very happy to share that update as what would have happened in the digital space."",
  ""And we wish Gifford a wonderful rest of the vacation that he so rightfully deserves."",
  ""So before we hop into our Q&A segment, of course, we're going to wrap up this part of the presentation, the main presentation for the investor briefing."",
  ""And as always, I will hand it back over to our group CEO, Keith Duncan to conclude the presentation ahead of our Q&A. Sir Keith?"",
  ""And that concludes the end of the main presentation of today's investor briefing."",
  ""And of course, as always, we now move into our Q&A segment where we've received some questions via the participants on the Zoom call."",
  ""Of course, we can't get through all questions due to time constraints, but we will certainly highlight and ensure that we touch as many people as we can based on the questions that were posed and of course, for those questions that we weren't able to address in this live stream, we will certainly reach out to the persons who would have asked those questions at the end of the call so that they can get their responses to the extent that we can respond because we are""
]","[
  ""So, we're in the process of putting together our application to the central bank to approve our hybrid digital branch at the So that is an active project that still remains in force."",
  ""We are on the cusp of determining the suite of products that we intend to offer to the market."",
  ""As you know, especially the Jamaican market has a number of offerings."",
  ""And so, we have been moving through our strategic process in terms of determining where is that white space, what is that need that exist so that we aren't coming to market with just another card to add to the many cards that are in market."",
  ""So, I would say within the next six months, we should be able to be in market with our card and our unique value proposition in that regard."",
  ""I can add to that, Patrick."",
  ""What I'd say is that I can add quickly to that."",
  ""On the JMMB Limited or Jamaica Money Market Brokerage Limited, as Patrick said, holds a lot of the group expenses."",
  ""However, I need to And I think just historically, that's the way it happened."",
  ""JMMB Limited was primarily a fixed income operator."",
  ""Then we had JMMB SL that we ."",
  ""So, without further ado, I'm going to bring up the first question here right out the gate, of course, it is from the gentleman who usually first out of the gate, And this question is for Patrick."",
  ""And so the question is what are capital assets?"",
  ""Is this real estate, JMMB Group through JMMB Investments collected JMD 1.59 billion from the sale of these assets over six months?"",
  ""So, when you – it's the real estate business like it is real estate."",
  ""The real estate business lines is one of our new business line, not generally new, but we have begun to build that out in a very strategic and direct way."",
  ""You would have seen in Q1 the gains arising from those sale of assets as we have monetized some of those assets and brought very strong cash flows to the group."",
  ""We have built out a very strong land bank within the group and within that business line."",
  ""You would have seen some positive developments coming out of that are our Allegheny property, which is basically completed."",
  ""So going forward through that business line, you will see gains arising from – when we take opportunities, having invested in those asset, one."",
  ""Two, you will also see the rental income cash flow coming arising from investing in those asset and also the mark-to-market gains that would have – that's going to arise as a result of that investment."",
  ""So we are very excited about it."",
  ""And you would have seen us realizing some of those gains in Q1."",
  ""And you will continue to see that as a consistent item in our P&L going forward."",
  ""And a second question from Right."",
  ""So, yes, the investment business line, it has been approved by the regulators."",
  ""We expect there are certain legal and regulatory procedures that we have to follow."",
  ""Our projected timeline, as our CEO mentioned, is the end of the financial year, 31st March."",
  ""So, we hope to have everything done by April 1st."",
  ""We do expect some savings from that because if you're merging entities together they're operating consolidation centralization."",
  ""You will get some savings from that."",
  ""As to the number that we are still working that through  so much, Patrick."",
  ""So I'm going to invite, our – we have a couple of questions here related to our banking operations here in Jamaica."",
  ""And I'm going to invite our CEO of JMMB Bank, Jerome Smalling, to respond."",
  ""One, the first one is, has JMMB Bank Jamaica received a capital injection from JMMB Financial Holdings during the six-month period that we're currently reporting on?"",
  ""And also, when will JMMB Group open its Hope Road location?"",
  ""Will there be a branch there?"",
  ""Jerome, if you could respond to that and then I'll read the second question for your response as well."",
  ""For the second question, Jerome, I'm sorry."",
  ""I'm just making sure I'm getting it right here."",
  ""What is the update on JMMB Bank bringing credit cards into its operations in the markets that we're presenting because we would have mentioned it in our prior annual report."",
  ""Could you give us an update on where we are with that, Jerome?"",
  ""So, heading back over now, Patrick, I'm going to invite Patrick to take this question from Well, Yeah."",
  ""I'd just like to double back before we move on to our next question."",
  ""I just wanted to double back to Jerome."",
  ""Just to highlight that in the previous question, Yeah."",
  ""We would have – I mean, the bank right now, I mean, we're adequately capitalized and we would have used our internal resources."",
  ""And I don't think we would have done – there would have been a need for additional capital injection within the quarter."",
  ""We would have done it in prior years and capitalized up to the financial year end."",
  ""We would have used internal reserves, which is our profitability in terms of transferring to our reserves and improving our Tier 1 capital within the quarter coming out of our audit period, but there would not have been a need for external funding subsequent to the financial year end."",
  ""As the bank continues to grow, it is an area of focus for us and where capital is required, the group will always support that."",
  "" very much, Patrick and , So we have a question here."",
  ""It says JMMB Investments or Jamaica Money Market Brokers saw an improvement in its Q3 and a six-month operating revenue."",
  ""However, expenses continue to exceed that figure."",
  ""What is being done apart from the recent VSP, which we would have mentioned in the presentation to maintain a tight ship in this difficult time, Patrick?"",
  ""And I think our CEO indicated it in wrapping up his presentation, but let me give you some context."",
  ""JMMB Limited, JMMB Investments has been the flagship for the group from inception."",
  ""It carried a lot of the costs, a lot of the group costs what was embedded within JMMB Investments."",
  ""So has the group grows and expand, and we are now under the financial holding company centralization, we would have articulated in What you would have seen, we would have taken a deliberate approach, a deliberate looked at the investment business line."",
  ""We would have committed look and what you would have seen is an improvement in terms of our cost of fund management."",
  ""You would have seen a reduction, not the growth in expenses was somewhat embedded from the build out, which was embedded in investment business arm."",
  ""But going forward month-over-month, we have put back the investment business line in terms of profitability."",
  ""Our CEO mentioned that it's not going to be a short term exercise, but you will continue to see that improvement as we go forward."",
  ""You will see that centralization."",
  ""We are committed in terms of monitoring of the cost, not just from a quarterly, day by day, monthly."",
  ""And as we streamline the investment business line, you will see a lower cost structure and where we have the costs more spread out within the group."",
  ""So, it's an exercise that we are committed to, that we are working through."",
  ""I don't know Keith, if you want to add anything to that."",
  ""This truly has been a wonderful, wonderful time of sharing and bringing all of you, our stakeholders, up to speed."",
  ""And, of course, members of the media up to speed on all things JMMB, especially looking at the first six months of our financial year."",
  ""We're pleased to have shared all of this information with you."",
  ""Now, please allow me, first of all, to thank everyone who would have been part of the working team to put this investor briefing together."",
  ""We would like to , our viewers, whether you are a current shareholder or prospective shareholder,  for joining us."",
  ""If you are a client,  as well for continuing to be a part of the JMMB family."",
  ""A special acknowledgement to all of our panelists online who answered questions during the live stream."",
  ""And of course, we are now in the middle of November."",
  ""So we are right here in the holiday season."",
  ""We're already seeing decorations and music and thing going on."",
  ""So we know that we are in the height of the holiday season."",
  ""We will not be seeing you in this forum before Christmas Day, certainly."",
  ""So please allow us to wish you a happy holiday season, a time filled with warmth, abundance, love and all that is good."",
  ""And God's willing, we will see you again in the new year.""

  ""Welcome to Nuwellis third quarter 2024  call."",
  ""On today's call, I will provide an overview of our third quarter performance and give an update on our strategic initiatives."",
  ""Followed by Dr. Jefferies, our Chief Medical Officer, who will provide a summary of the recent publication on the efficacy of Nuwellis in a real-world community hospital setting."",
  ""Our Chief Financial Officer, Rob Scott, will then provide detailed commentary on our financial results before opening up the call for questions, followed by my closing remarks."",
  ""Nuwellis generated $2.4 million in revenue for the third quarter of 2024, a 2% decrease year-over-year."",
  ""However, sequentially, we grew 8% over Q2."",
  ""While the adult category of our business saw a lower volume of patients treated during the summer month, our pediatric customer category experienced a surge in revenue of 28% compared to the same quarter of last year, driven by three new pediatric accounts opened this quarter, including one of the largest hospital networks in Florida."",
  ""We also experienced a sequential improvement in pediatric For the remainder of our customer category, critical care and heart failure were down 25% and 36%, respectively on lower consumables utilization and console sales, reflecting the generally lower volume of patients treated during the summer months."",
  ""One of our key initiatives for the last three years have been to build our body of clinical evidence in order to make this therapy standard of care and get into the Medical Society guidelines."",
  ""In support of this initiative, I would like now to turn it over to Dr. Jefferies to discuss the latest addition to our growing body of clinical evidence and the impact that this clinical information may have in broad day to day clinical practice."",
  ""All participants will be in listen-only mode."",
  "" for joining today's conference call to discuss Nuwellis' corporate developments and financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024."",
  ""In addition to myself, with us today are Nestor Jaramillo, Nuwellis' President and CEO; Dr. John Jefferies, our Chief Medical Officer; as well as Rob Scott, our CFO."",
  ""At 8 AM Eastern time today, Nuwellis released financial results for the third quarter 2024."",
  ""If you have not received Nuwellis' , please visit the investors page on the company's website."",
  ""During today's call, the company will be making forward-looking statements."",
  ""All forward-looking statements made during today's call will be protected under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Any statements that relate to expectations or predictions of future events and market trends, as well as our estimated results or performance are forward-looking statements."",
  ""All forward-looking statements are based upon our current estimates and various assumptions."",
  ""These statements involve material risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to materially differ from those anticipated or implied by these forward-looking statements."",
  ""All forward-looking statements are based upon current available information, and the company assumes no obligation to update these statements."",
  ""Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on these statements."",
  ""Please refer to the cautionary statements and discussion of risks in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the latest 10-K. With that, I now would like to turn the call over to Nestor."",
  ""In August, we announced the publication of a new study in current problems in cardiology, demonstrating the effectiveness of Aquadex in significantly reducing 60-day hospital readmission rates for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure who are otherwise resistant to diuretic treatment in a community hospital setting."",
  ""As a senior author on this paper, I was pleased to see the analysis of an Aquadex program in community based regional hospitals, showing how refractory acute decompensated heart failure patients benefited from significant volume loss and weight reduction, along with stable renal function and remarkable clinical benefit."",
  ""I would like to highlight that the outcomes of this community-based hospital setting trial demonstrate the broader applicability and effectiveness of the Aquadex therapy."",
  ""Real-world data in some ways is often more powerful than randomized controlled trials because it uses everyday patients that need to be treated rather than a cohort of pre-selected patients, which typically occurs as a certain group of academic institutions."",
  ""The outcome of this study shows that ultrafiltration can be very effective for these real-world types of patients."",
  ""This is vital for Nuwellis' strategy, as we now have the data to leverage as we expand the use of this therapy to these hospitals in a non-academic center setting."",
  ""Going deeper into the study's findings, it showed that favorable Aquadex therapy programs can result and achieved early as shown in this hospital system in the form of reduced, acute decompensated heart failure readmissions."",
  ""There are numerically fewer 30-day acute decompensated heart failure readmissions after Aquadex program initiation compared to pre-program initiation with a statistical p-value of 0.351."",
  ""However, at 60 days there were significantly fewer acute decompensated heart failure readmissions with a statistically significant p-value of 0.013."",
  ""Additionally, patients experienced significant volume reduction with a mean food loss of 9.4 liters and a significant weight loss with a mean decrease of 7.4 kilograms."",
  ""Notably, all 30 patients had stable renal function and no significant change in serum creatinine, a test used to measure kidney function at 72 hours of ultrafiltration therapy."",
  ""Finally, the study had important practical implications for heart failure clinics, demonstrating that a successful Aquadex program is reproducible and can be coordinated by general cardiologists without the need for a dedicated heart failure unit."",
  ""We continue to enroll patients in the REVERSE-HF trial, which is designed to help increase awareness and provide the data to support becoming standard of care."",
  ""The study has enrolled over one-third of the patients contemplated by the protocol."",
  ""I welcome any questions on this new evidence during the Q&A session."",
  ""And now I'd like to turn to Rob to discuss our third quarter financial results."",
  ""Turning to the Q3 financial results, revenue for the third quarter was $2.4 million, representing an 8% sequential growth and a 2% decline over the prior year period."",
  ""Our pediatric customer category surged with a 28% increase compared to a year ago as we expanded our Aquadex offerings to three new pediatric centers, one of which is within one of the largest hospital networks in Florida."",
  ""Our critical care and heart failure customer categories were down 25% and 36% year-over-year, respectively."",
  ""These declines are due to lower consumables utilization in the summer months and also because of console sales."",
  ""Gross margin was 70% for the third quarter compared to gross margin of 57.3% in the prior year quarter."",
  ""The margin improvement was primarily driven by higher manufacturing volumes of consumables and lower fixed overhead manufacturing expenses."",
  ""Selling, general and administrative expenses were $2.7 million in the third quarter, a decrease of approximately 21% as compared to $3.4 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The decrease in SG&A was primarily realized through efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023."",
  ""Third quarter research and development expense was $486,000, compared to $1.1 million in the prior year period."",
  ""The decrease in R&D expense was primarily due to reduced consulting fees and compensation related expenses."",
  ""Total operating expenses were $3.2 million in the quarter, a decrease of approximately $1.4 million, or 30% as compared to the third quarter of 2023 as we continue to realize savings from operating efficiency initiatives enacted in the second half of 2023."",
  ""Operating loss in the third quarter was $1.5 million, compared to an operating loss of $3.2 million in the prior year period, resulting in a $1.7 million period-over-period improvement."",
  ""Net income attributable to common shareholders in the third quarter was $2.4 million or a gain of a $1.74 per share compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of $3.4 million or a loss of $63.27 per share for the same period in 2023."",
  ""Third quarter net income improvement was primarily the result of the revaluation of a prior period warrant liability resulting in a $3.9 million benefit."",
  ""We ended the third quarter with $1.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and with no debt on the balance sheet."",
  ""Our cash balance in the third quarter includes the August and July registered direct offerings priced at the market under Nasdaq rules As we previously disclosed, we mutually terminated our license and distribution agreement with SeaStar Medical, resulting in a settlement in October whereby they agreed to pay Nuwellis $900,000 by the end of the calendar year."",
  ""We received approximately $500,000 in the month of October."",
  ""This concludes our prepared remarks."",
  ""Operator, we would now like to open the call to questions.""
]","[
  ""I would like to ask you to walk us through an economic comparison of the now profitable given the heightened reimbursement, the now profitable way that hospitals can use Aquadex in the outpatient setting and the money they would make versus the money they would make doing ultrafiltration a different way for these same outpatients."",
  ""So you would see this totally replacing the inpatient population for those that don't have to be there for some other reason."",
  ""So then, I mean, is there any difference in actual outpatient medical benefit between these two procedures, meaning Aquadex versus some sort of dialysis machine they might use."",
  ""As long as the hospital can justify doing no harm, it's always going to make more money, if it can."",
  ""So then what's the crux of what All right."",
  ""Also, when can we expect the REVERSE-HF trial data?"",
  ""Sorry, I had concomitant calls."",
  ""So maybe you said something about timelines and enrollment percent already."",
  ""And if you did, would you please reiterate that?"",
  ""You mean – okay to the FDA you mean?"",
  ""And did you give an update for Vivian progress?"",
  ""So these new rates, which are substantially higher for Ultrafiltration go into effect 1/1/2025 correct?"",
  ""And how are you internally preparing the organization to capitalize on this in all three phases, right; pediatric, critical care and heart failure?"",
  ""Specifically, how are you addressing this with your customers?"",
  ""What's the go forward plan?"",
  ""Do you feel like at this point you have all the personnel you need in place or do you believe that with this higher reimbursement, you may hire a couple of either clinical people or salespeople to try to accelerate the adoption?"",
  ""I'll hop back in the queue."",
  ""This may take a little long, this explanation."",
  ""Right now, the only way that ultrafiltration is provided is in the inpatient and patients get hospitalized and it takes anywhere from three to five days to remove the fluid of these patients."",
  ""If you – and then the reimbursement is, there are three With this reimbursement now the hospitals can provide ultrafiltration in the outpatient setting."",
  ""It could be in an observation unit or even in the ER and the patient doesn't need to be admitted in the hospital."",
  ""Secondly, the reimbursement now is $1,639 per day, so if the patient needs three days to remove the fluid that the physician recommends, then it will be that amount every day."",
  ""So the hospital now, given our cost of the circuit, which is $900, the hospital can make $700 a day for treating these patients."",
  ""And again, the patient can take anywhere from three days treating the patient, coming in and out of the observation unit."",
  ""And so, therefore, the hospital will have more profits from the therapy."",
  ""It could replace admitting the patient in the hospital, decongesting the patient in the ER or in the observation unit, not needing to admit the patient in the ICU or in the hospital, therefore, will replace the inpatient treatment of using ultrafiltration."",
  ""We believe that treating patients with decompensated heart failure in the outpatient would be more profitable for the hospitals."",
  ""And I forgot to mention one other aspect of treating patients in the inpatient."",
  ""If the patient gets readmitted within 30 days, then the hospital doesn't get paid by CMS or most private payers and also, it assumes some penalties."",
  ""So that's another savings because the patient was not admitted."",
  ""In terms of the patient, the benefit to the patient, it is well documented that patients that get hospitalized, regardless of what is the condition, the mortality rate goes up."",
  ""So therefore, by not having to be admitted, you don't – are exposed to those high mortality rates."",
  ""In addition, the treatment would be anywhere from four to six hours and the patient – after that, the patient can just go home and then schedule the next visit."",
  ""So for the patient, it would be much better and also a better quality of life."",
  ""Yeah, Jonathan, that's a good question."",
  ""You know, and we have internally debated what were the reasons."",
  ""When we started the conversations with DaVita, we had a champion in that organization."",
  ""As soon as we signed the agreement, that champion got promoted and then we were assigned a different team."",
  ""So we lost a little bit of momentum there."",
  ""Also, at the beginning, we did not target the right centers."",
  ""We target centers that were very – that were good customers of Nuwellis and they were happy treating the patients by their staff in the inpatient."",
  ""They did not need the DaVita personnel."",
  ""So then we pivot and then we went to accounts that were familiar with ultrafiltration."",
  ""They had issues with capital budgets and personnel, and it just took a little too long for them to get ready to use ultrafiltration provided by DaVita."",
  ""At the at the current rate of enrollment, we expect to finished the enrollment period by the middle of 2026."",
  ""And then after that, there is a 90-day follow-up and then we would have the data analyzed and be ready to submit by the end of 2026."",
  ""Well, not to the FDA."",
  ""This is not a – I'm sorry, not to the FDA, to submit to publications ... And to submit to the medical societies for them to include this therapy in the guidelines, assuming and we expect the results to be very favorable."",
  ""Yes, we continue the development phase of Vivian and we're estimating that by the end of the 2025, we would be ready to start the in-human clinical study."",
  ""It would be an IDE trial."",
  ""That will be an FDA trial."",
  ""And we have already agreed on the protocol with the FDA."",
  ""Well, first of all, we're very excited about this new And also, they need to set up what is called the order sets."",
  ""And also, we're going to ensure that those hospitals in those territories do have coverage from either local CMS administrators and also private payers."",
  ""So we're getting ready on both helping the hospitals get set up, as well as making sure that the reimbursement is ready to be filed."",
  ""Right now, we have nine territories in place with sales reps and clinical specialists."",
  ""So we can start with those – in those territories."",
  ""Most of these hospitals that were doing ultrafiltration in the outpatient in the past, we haven't covered."",
  ""So we will not need to add anyone in the field to get started with the ultrafiltration in the outpatient."",
  ""We are going to look into bringing some expertise when it comes to reimbursement inside in the headquarters."",
  ""We continue to see momentum in our business with new accounts steadily opening on increasing awareness of the efficacy and supporting clinical evidence for all Aquadex ultrafiltration in the adult and pediatric customer categories."",
  ""We believe these clinical results, as described by Dr. Jefferies, will have a positive impact in growing our business and supporting Aquadex in becoming the standard of care for fluid removal when diuretics are ineffective."",
  ""As we reported early last week, we were pleased to announce the company received the notice of the – from the Center of Medicare and Medicaid Services, also known as CMS, that the Aquadex Ultrafiltration Code will be reassigned to the outpatient reimbursement level, most consistent with the administration of ultrafiltration therapy and cost of treatment."",
  ""So effective January 1, 2025, the facility reimbursement fee will increase 297% from $413 to $1,639 per day."",
  ""With this increased reimbursement, we are opening a new chapter for Nuwellis."",
  ""We anticipate seeing accelerated top line growth from this rate increase."",
  ""As a point of clarification, the prior announcement reflected the reimbursement increase at 397%."",
  ""Additionally, as reported early last week, the company raised $5.1 million in gross proceeds from warrant exercises and through a warrant inducement solicitation."",
  ""I want to thank all the stakeholders, Nuwellis employees, stockholders, physicians, nurses and patients and healthcare workers in the field."",
  ""Without your support, we would not be able to achieve key advances in transforming the lives of patients suffering from fluid overload."",
  "" for your participation and support.""

  ""I'll start by highlighting three key messages I want to leave with you today."",
  ""Number one, we're delivering strong, consistent financial performance."",
  ""These results are a reflection of the CIBC team's focus on proactively managing our bank and consistently executing our strategy to serve our clients."",
  ""Number two, we have the right strategy to further our growth momentum into fiscal 2025 and beyond."",
  ""Our client-focused strategy leverages the competitive advantages we've built over time, and it emphasizes high growth and profitable client segments."",
  ""This is a long-term journey and we're on the right track."",
  ""And number three, we enter fiscal 2025 in a position of strength with a robust capital position, strong credit quality, and a dedicated CIBC team that is the driving force behind our growth."",
  ""Now, turning to our adjusted results for fiscal 2024."",
  ""This morning, we reported net earnings of CAD 7.3 billion, showcasing the strength and resiliency of our diversified platform."",
  ""Earnings per share was CAD 7.40, up 10% year-over-year."",
  ""Revenues of CAD 25.6 billion were also up 10%, driven by robust margin expansion, selective balance sheet growth, and higher fee-based income in our market-based businesses."",
  ""Pre-provision, pre-tax earnings of CAD 11.3 billion were up 11%, supported by a record revenue performance and positive operating leverage."",
  ""Credit quality remains resilient across our portfolios."",
  ""This quarter, underpinned by our capital strength and a CET1 ratio of 13.3%, we bought back 5 million shares, and announced an 8% or CAD 0.07 increase in our quarterly dividend to common shareholders."",
  ""This increase reinforces the confidence we have to deliver earnings growth within our publicly stated target of 7% to 10%."",
  ""We delivered a 13.7% ROE, which is up 30 basis points versus the prior year, despite an elevated capital buffer."",
  ""And we remain committed to delivering a premium ROE through the steady execution of our strategy over time."",
  ""On that note, I wanted to quickly recap our strategic priorities, which play to our strengths and reflect key opportunities for growth in the market."",
  ""Our first strategic priority is to grow our mass affluent private wealth franchise across Canada and the United States."",
  ""In Canada, our Imperial Service achieved the number 1 ranking of the 2024 Investment Executive Report Card on Banks for the ninth year in a row."",
  ""In the US, we achieved the number 2 ranking in Barron's Top 100 RIA Firms, up from the prior year and marking our fifth consecutive year in the top 10."",
  ""We have established clear momentum serving our clients in this segment and we have the right talent and technology to win."",
  ""Our second strategic priority is to expand our digital banking offerings."",
  ""For the seventh time in the last eight years, CIBC was ranked number 1 by Surviscor for delivering the best mobile banking experience among Canada's big banks."",
  ""We have a proven track record of aligning innovation to meet client needs, which positions us to earn more business through our digital channels."",
  ""Our third strategic priority is to leverage our highly connected platform to deliver all of our bank to our clients."",
  ""Our connected culture and platform is a differentiator and our strong client experience scores reflect the benefits our clients see from this approach."",
  ""We have the right platforms and the right culture to continue winning more business as we build deep and profitable relationships with our clients."",
  ""Finally, our fourth strategic priority is to enable, simplify and protect our bank."",
  ""Having the right technology, the right talent, and the right governance is critical to deliver consistent performance."",
  ""We're excited by the potential of new AI technologies."",
  ""Our progress here was recognized in the most recent Evident AI Index rankings, where CIBC achieved the greatest year-over-year improvement amongst all banks in the index."",
  ""We're finding a balance with AI, taking a thoughtful, responsible approach to innovation in ways that will help our clients and help our CIBC team members achieve their ambitions."",
  ""So we've made the right investments to shape our bank for the future, and we will continue to invest strategically to mitigate risk and to maximize opportunity."",
  ""Now with that, let's turn to our segment highlights."",
  ""In Canadian Personal and Business Banking, our efforts to deepen existing client relationships and attract new clients are supporting profitable growth in key areas."",
  ""Over the past 12 months, we welcomed over 600,000 net new clients across our bank."",
  ""Our welcome offers for new clients prioritize multi-product relationships and have driven meaningful market share gains in demand deposits over the past year."",
  ""This quarter, we also expanded our cards rewards offerings through partnerships with Expedia and others to further bolster our growth."",
  ""Looking ahead, we expect mortgage growth and consumer discretionary spending to accelerate as lower interest rates spur client demand through 2025."",
  ""As long-term historical growth rates return as anticipated, we will maintain our pricing discipline and we'll maintain our focus on profitability."",
  ""In our North American Commercial Banking businesses, client activity slowed as elevated interest rates limited global economic growth over the past year."",
  ""In Canada, our team was there for our clients to help them navigate a changing market."",
  ""In the United States, despite a slower environment, our high-touch approach delivered above-market loan and deposit volume growth in our US C&I portfolio."",
  ""Our disciplined relationship-based lending approach has translated into strong credit metrics across our portfolios, including impaired PCLs that have trended lower."",
  ""Looking ahead, we expect Canadian and US commercial loan demand to pick up in line with economic growth expectations for 2025 and beyond."",
  ""So we're well-positioned to capture growth momentum, while maintaining the risk discipline that has served us so well through this credit cycle."",
  ""Across our North American Wealth Management platform, we're capturing new client business as financial markets benefit from a more supportive interest rate environment."",
  ""In Canada, success with our investment-grade bond fund lineup has propelled us to the top ranking for IFIC mutual fund net flows among the big six banks."",
  ""And we continue to gain market share in mutual fund AUM."",
  ""In the US, we had new client AUM flows up 43%, which is a new record that was supported by the addition of new relationship managers."",
  ""Looking ahead, further interest rate reductions are expected to drive fund flows out of term deposits and into alternative risk assets in the face of lower yields."",
  ""Our wealth businesses are already benefiting from this trend and are well-positioned to continue gaining momentum through next year."",
  ""In Capital Markets, our diversified platform delivered another year of consistent execution and steady growth."",
  ""In Canada, we maintained a strong market share position with our strategic and focused clients with robust trading volumes and record debt capital markets revenues, both driven by strong client activity."",
  ""In the United States, we delivered Capital Markets revenue growth of 21% as we continue to expand our capabilities south of the border."",
  ""Looking ahead, the lower interest rate path is supportive of higher bond issuance and investment banking activity next year."",
  ""We will continue supporting our clients with a connected approach across our North American platform as activity picks up through the years ahead."",
  ""So in closing, we entered 2025 with purpose, with momentum and with grounded confidence."",
  ""As central banks continue to reduce rates, we expect a rebound in activity across interest-sensitive sectors."",
  ""Against this backdrop, our businesses are well-positioned."",
  ""Our CIBC team is focused on consistent execution and we have a strategy that is delivering and will continue to deliver its intended outcomes."",
  ""Before I turn the call over to Rob, I'd like to introduce Susan Rimmer, who has joined our CIBC Executive Committee to lead our Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management business."",
  ""Susan's background in capital markets and client-focused approach will serve us well in advancing the connected culture that already differentiates our bank."",
  ""And she'll be available for Q&A following our prepared remarks."",
  ""And with that, over to you, Rob, for a review of our financial results."",
  ""We will begin this morning's presentation with opening remarks from Victor Dodig, our President and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Rob Sedran, our Chief Financial Officer; and Frank Guse, our Chief Risk Officer."",
  ""Also on the call today are a number of our group heads, including Shawn Beber from the US region, Harry Culham from Capital Markets, Global Asset Management and Enterprise Strategy, Hratch Panossian from Personal and Business Banking Canada, and Susan Rimmer, Commercial Banking and Wealth Management."",
  ""They are all available to take questions following the prepared remarks."",
  ""Given we have a hard stop at 8:30, please limit your questions to one during the Q&A to allow everyone to participate."",
  ""We'll make ourselves available after the call for any follow-ups."",
  ""As noted on slide 2 of our investor presentation, our comments may contain forward-looking statements, which may involve assumptions and have inherent risks and uncertainties."",
  ""Actual results may differ materially."",
  ""I would also remind listeners that the bank uses non-GAAP financial measures to arrive at adjusted results."",
  ""Management measures performance on a reported and adjusted basis and considers both to be useful in assessing underlying business performance."",
  ""With that, I'll now turn the call over to Victor."",
  ""I'll begin with three takeaways from our Q4 results."",
  ""First, our focus on execution and risk control growth continues to produce strong and consistent results, and we are confident that we can continue to build on that momentum in fiscal 2025."",
  ""Second, we repurchased shares, while continuing to strengthen our balance sheet supported by disciplined capital allocation that balances volume and margin and prioritizes core client growth."",
  ""And third, we managed a positive operating leverage for the fifth consecutive quarter, while continuing to invest in growth, our infrastructure and efficiency initiatives."",
  ""Let's now move to a detailed review."",
  ""Unless otherwise noted results are being compared with Q4 of 2023."",
  ""We reported earnings per share of CAD 1.90 for Q4 2024, or CAD 1.91 on an adjusted basis and ROE of 13.4%."",
  ""We delivered record consolidated revenue and strong credit quality across all of our business units."",
  ""Please turn to slide 11."",
  ""Adjusted net income of CAD 1.9 billion increased 24%."",
  ""Pre-provision, pre-tax earnings of CAD 2.8 billion were up 16%, and revenues of CAD 6.6 billion were up 13%, supported by improved spread income, higher trading revenues, and continued growth across our fee-based businesses."",
  ""We continue to manage expenses relative to revenues, while investing to support our strategy and posted 180 basis points of operating leverage."",
  ""Provisions for credit losses were again down significantly from a year ago."",
  ""Frank will discuss credit in detail in his presentation."",
  ""Slide 12 highlights key drivers of net interest income."",
  ""Excluding trading, NII was up 17%, driven by expanding margins and continued balance sheet growth."",
  ""Total bank NIM ex-trading was up 20 basis points from the prior year and 2 basis points sequentially, mainly from higher loan and deposit margins."",
  ""Canadian P&C NIM of 269 basis points was also up 2 basis points, driven by favorable business mix and wider deposit and loan margins."",
  ""For both the all bank and P&C margins, we maintain our expectation of a neutral-to-positive bias over time based on current interest rate assumptions embedded in the forward curve."",
  ""In the US segment, NIM of 363 basis points was up 21 basis points from the prior quarter, mainly driven by higher loan margins."",
  ""When the Fed cuts rates due to contractual terms, there's a lag before loans are repriced, resulting in a temporary margin increase this quarter."",
  ""Excluding this impact, core margins were up roughly 7 basis points."",
  ""Going forward, we expect margins in the US segment to return to the 350-basis-point range and then be stable to slightly up from there with the possibility of temporary help from time to time if and when rate cuts happen."",
  ""Turning to slide 13, non-interest income of CAD 3 billion was up 13% from the prior year, with strong growth in trading as well as a 19% increase in other market-related fees."",
  ""Transaction-related fees were down 15% and mainly represent the permanent shift of VA-related revenues into net interest income."",
  ""Slide 14 highlights our balanced approach to expense management."",
  ""Excluding performance-based comp, linked to the stronger revenues, expenses grew 4%."",
  ""We continue to realize efficiencies, while investing for the future, including in the ongoing development of our AI capabilities around our bank."",
  ""Moving forward, we target expense growth in the mid-single-digit range and plan our expense growth relative to revenues to deliver positive operating leverage on an annual basis."",
  ""Slide 15 highlights the strength of our balance sheet."",
  ""Our CET1 ratio ended the quarter, still rounding to 13.3%, increasing 5 basis points from last quarter."",
  ""Solid organic capital generation was partially offset by RWA increases and the roughly 5 million shares we repurchased during the quarter."",
  ""Our liquidity position is strong with an average LCR of 129%, up from 126% last quarter."",
  ""Starting on slide 16, with Personal and Business Banking, we highlight our strategic business unit results."",
  ""Net income of CAD 748 million was up 17% due to higher revenue growth and lower credit losses, partly offset by higher expenses."",
  ""Revenues of CAD 2.7 billion increased 9%, and pre-provision, pre-tax earnings were up 13%, driven by an 18-basis-point increase in margin, volume growth on both sides of the balance sheet and higher fee income."",
  ""These results were supported by strong net client growth and franchising success."",
  ""Our focus on digital is driving market share gains in targeted segments."",
  ""Expenses were up 5% due to higher employee-related and performance-based compensation."",
  ""On slide 17, we show Canadian Commercial Banking and Wealth Management where net income was up 5% and pre-provision, pre-tax earnings were up 7% from a year ago."",
  ""Revenues of CAD 1.5 billion were up 11%, driven by strong wealth management growth of 21%, with higher average fee-based assets on both increased client activity and market appreciation."",
  ""For the full year, CIBC Asset Management ranked first among the big six banks in both total and long-term retail mutual fund net sales."",
  ""Commercial Banking revenue was stable to the prior year, as higher volumes were largely offset by lower net interest margin."",
  ""Expenses increased 16% from a year ago, mainly from higher compensation linked to the strong Wealth Management revenues and increased spending on strategic initiatives."",
  ""Additional detail on our combined Canadian Personal and Commercial Banking franchise have been included in the appendix."",
  ""Turning to US Commercial Banking and Wealth Management on slide 18, net income of $150 million was up $111 million from the prior year, mainly due to lower loan loss provisions and an 11% increase in pre-provision, pre-tax earnings."",
  ""Revenues were up 9% due to both higher net interest income and fee income across all products."",
  ""Our strategy and focus on connectivity has allowed us to grow and deepen our US client franchise, generating above-market C&I loan growth and strong deposit growth."",
  ""Expenses were up 8% year-on-year as we continue to invest in growth initiatives and the infrastructure to support them."",
  ""Going forward, we expect expense growth in this segment similar to that experienced this quarter and would remind you that the first quarter typically has higher expenses, mainly due to seasonally elevated employee-related costs."",
  ""Turning to slide 19 and our Capital Markets and DFS segment."",
  ""Net income of CAD 428 million was up 12% year-over-year."",
  ""Revenues of CAD 1.4 billion were up 9%, driven by strong results from Global Markets and continued growth in our Direct Financial Services business, as well as higher debt underwriting revenues."",
  ""Expenses were up 6% and included the impact of higher performance-based compensation linked to stronger revenues."",
  ""Slide 20 reflects the results of the Corporate and Other business unit, which shows a net loss of CAD 7 million compared with a net loss of CAD 48 million in the prior year, driven by improved treasury and higher revenues from CIBC Caribbean."",
  ""Slide 21 highlights our full-year performance and outlook."",
  ""Our fiscal 2024 results demonstrate our progress in executing our strategy."",
  ""We grew revenue, pre-provision earnings and EPS by double-digits to record levels, ahead of our medium-term targets."",
  ""We delivered positive operating leverage, while balancing continued investments to both grow and protect our bank, including through the rising impact of AI across our bank."",
  ""ROE of 13.7% was up 30 basis points from the prior year, but below our medium-term target, largely owing to the impact of higher capital requirements."",
  ""Our medium-term targets are unchanged, with the exception of incorporating the higher capital requirements into our ROE target."",
  ""Our conviction and confidence in our strategy and the ROE it will deliver has, in fact, grown since we set the previous target at our Investor Day in 2022."",
  ""However, we must acknowledge the need to carry between 100 basis points and 150 basis points more CET1 capital to satisfy regulatory minimums."",
  ""As such, we are moving our ROE target to 15%-plus, a level to which we will build with the aspiration of driving to a premium ROE in Canada."",
  ""In closing, we had a strong year in 2024 and are expecting to build on that success from here."",
  ""We strongly believe that we have the right strategy, the right assets supporting that strategy and the right people, connected culture, and financial strength to execute on the opportunities we see in front of us."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it over to Frank."",
  ""Our credit portfolio's performance for 2024 was strong and ended the year at the lower end of our guidance, despite the challenging macroenvironment."",
  ""We have maintained our focus on managing our lending portfolios with prudent and effective account management strategies to mitigate risk."",
  ""We remain confident in the quality and resilience of our credit portfolios."",
  ""Our allowance coverage has also remained elevated and is reflective of our sound risk management."",
  ""Turning to slide 24, our total provision for credit losses was CAD 419 million in Q4, compared to CAD 483 million last quarter, with our allowance remaining flat quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""Our performing provisions were modest at CAD 2 million this quarter."",
  ""On a full-year basis, our performing allowance grew by CAD 244 million, or 8% year-over-year, mainly from additions to our Canadian retail and US commercial portfolios."",
  ""This quarter, our provision on impaired loans was CAD 417 million, up CAD 13 million quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""This was due to higher provisions in the US commercial portfolio, partially offset by lower provisions in Canadian Banking and Capital Markets."",
  ""Our full-year provisions for credit losses on impaired loans was 32 basis points."",
  ""Our retail portfolio experienced higher year-over-year losses, driven by an elevated rate environment and higher unemployment."",
  ""Our teams work closely with clients through these challenging times to find solutions and mitigate potential losses."",
  ""Our Canadian Commercial Banking and Capital Markets portfolios performed very well, despite the macro headwinds this year, with no specific sectoral stress in either of these portfolios."",
  ""We also entered the year working through the challenges of our US office portfolio."",
  ""I'm proud of how our experienced team proactively worked through the various issues early, resulting in lower losses over the second half of the year."",
  ""While uncertainty remains in the market, we are pleased with our credit performance in fiscal 2024 and our team remains focused to mitigate risk for potential headwinds."",
  ""Slide 26 summarizes our gross impaired loans and formations."",
  ""Gross impaired loans were up by 2 basis points this quarter, mainly due to an increase in our US commercial portfolio."",
  ""New formations of impaired loans in US commercial were still down on a year-over-year basis, despite the increase this quarter."",
  ""These primarily came from a few loans in the US multifamily sector, where we continue to see strength in fundamentals and demand for this asset class."",
  ""Slide 27 summarizes the net write-offs and 90-plus-day delinquency rates of our Canadian consumer portfolios that remained stable quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""Negative trends in unemployment rates will continue to be a driver of performance for our credit cards and unsecured personal lending portfolios."",
  ""In our mortgage book, we continue to see positive trends overall with negatively amortizing mortgage balances down from CAD 38 billion in Q1 to CAD 18 billion this quarter, more recently driven by interest rate cuts."",
  ""We remain comfortable with the overall credit quality of our Canadian consumer portfolios."",
  ""On slide 28, we have updated our disclosure on Canadian mortgage renewals sensitivity based on the current market rates."",
  ""With mortgage rates that are now between 4% and 5%, clients will be able to renew at levels below what they had initially qualified at and experience less of a payment shock."",
  ""In the outer year maturity strips, some clients could see their monthly payments decrease on renewals."",
  ""Overall, our mortgage portfolio has performed well with losses remaining at 1 basis point, notwithstanding rates that remained elevated over the past two years."",
  ""We remain confident in the continued resilience of this portfolio."",
  ""In closing, we entered the year with unemployment trending upwards, interest rates at peak levels, and sectoral pressures impacting our US office portfolio."",
  ""Despite these headwinds, we were able to deliver a strong year of results."",
  ""This not only highlights our team's ability to take decisive action to mitigate losses but also underscores how our strategic choices have strengthened our credit portfolio."",
  ""This gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the economic challenges that may be ahead in 2025."",
  ""As we look ahead, we expect impaired provisions in retail to trend slightly higher while experiencing lower impaired provisions in US commercial."",
  ""While we remain cautious about the upcoming year and continue to monitor market uncertainties, our guidance for impaired loan losses for fiscal 2025 remains in the mid-30-basis-point range."",
  ""This should trend towards the lower end of this guidance if current economic uncertainties subside."",
  ""To conclude, we are very pleased with our solid risk performance in fiscal 2024 and are comfortable with our strong allowance coverage heading into 2025."",
  ""And I will now turn the call back to the operator.""
]","[
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Maybe we can start with one on the mortgage business."",
  ""It just sounds like the market has been pretty competitive on that front on pricing."",
  ""So maybe can you talk about how you're balancing your objectives on profitability with making sure you maintain your share in that space, particularly given the levels of renewals that are coming back."",
  ""I guess, maybe just wanted to follow up."",
  ""So, Hratch,  for the color."",
  ""But I think, Victor, you said in your prepared remarks mortgage growth and consumer discretionary spending to accelerate in 2025."",
  ""We had a bit of a more cautious commentary from one of your peers yesterday."",
  ""I think as we tried to figure out where the Canadian economy is going, is it safe to declare that the worst is behind us and things – the cyclical rebound that the markets are discounting in these stocks is already underway and we should feel confident unemployment moving in the right direction given your base case and the comment you made?"",
  ""I need to follow up, Victor, to that around you said the regulators might level the playing field."",
  ""I think the expectation on the US is – you're right, I think we will see more predictable, maybe capital neutral to positive outcomes."",
  ""Does that mean we should anticipate maybe the floor factor could get permanently changed, or the DSB buffer is that the – range has reduced?"",
  ""Like, how should we think about where the regulators may level the playing field?"",
  ""I don't know, Victor or Rob, maybe both."",
  ""But just can you talk a bit more about your discussions around lowering the medium-term ROE target?"",
  ""You talked about higher regulatory capital."",
  ""But can you talk about what your CET1 assumption was back at the Investor Day, what your CET1 assumption is today?"",
  ""And where do you think you can run this?"",
  ""Because when I read the math, it seems like you need to have a 12.5% to 12% to get that CET1 rate or that ROE back up into that 15%, 16% level."",
  ""So I'm just trying to get some context in how much maybe even buybacks kind of factor into this."",
  ""I just wanted to quickly go to Shawn Beber."",
  ""Shawn, your business on an adjusted basis, pre-tax, pre-provision was about $230 million or $240 million, so call it, run rate in close to about $1 billion."",
  ""Like, is that a good number do you think for you looking ahead?"",
  ""Should you be able to do this around to $240 million as most of the investing behind you now?"",
  ""And should we start thinking about a bit more growth out of your segment looking head?"",
  ""Victor, during the Q3 call, I think you gave a very detailed answer in terms of capital deployment priorities, and you talked about a bias towards organic capital deployment and return of capital."",
  ""But the world has changed a lot since then."",
  ""The outlook for the US is very, very strong and we have the question mark around tariffs and the impact on Canada."",
  ""So the question is, does that impact your capital deployment thinking?"",
  ""And maybe to put it more directly, why not get bigger in the US quickly, inorganically, to take advantage of what's likely to be a booming US economy?"",
  ""You already have a base there, but why not get more aggressive right now?"",
  ""So just if I could follow up on that."",
  ""I guess, what you're saying is you don't feel an added urgency to deploy capital in the US."",
  ""Just a point of clarification, Rob."",
  ""When you said earlier you see margin as a tailwind for the next couple of years, are you talking about all-bank net interest margins?"",
  ""Or are you talking more along the lines of marginal growth?"",
  ""And then if I could squeeze another quick one in here, just the outlook for the tax rate moving forward."",
  ""Just first one on the credit guidance."",
  ""And if I'm understanding you correctly, it's that the loss rate will be higher in the – at the start of the year and grade down over the course of the year."",
  ""That's consistent with what another bank said in contrast to what a different bank said."",
  ""Just wondering why your outlook might be different."",
  ""I know there's portfolio trends and all that stuff that play a role."",
  ""Is it largely because the – that CRE, office CRE portfolio loss rate continues to decline, and that's going to offset stuff over the course of the year?"",
  ""And then, a conceptual one, I guess, for Victor and/or Rob, or both."",
  ""So this ROE target, it's – I guess, one of the big moving – or one of the big factors affecting it is the regulatory capital requirement, which has changed since your Investor Day."",
  ""So I guess, your base assumption is maintaining 12.75% to 13% core Tier 1 ratio."",
  ""Like, what if the domestic stability buffer is cut back substantially, do you change that management target range?"",
  ""Or do you keep it static because it could always go back up?"",
  ""I'm trying to get an understanding of how fluid your core Tier 1 ratio target is because, as I just mentioned, the capital requirement could be reduced, but they can also be held back because some might just say, hey, let's plan as if that maximum is in effect always."",
  ""I'm talking more about the upside if it goes down."",
  ""Is it – so this is really a fluid management target range if it goes down."",
  ""You react to a reduction if that were to happen."",
  ""And that's perfectly rational, but it's also perfectly rational to assume that the higher requirement is maintained."",
  ""So it can make managing your ROE target difficult, I guess, is what I'm saying."",
  ""Well, congrats on the full year."",
  ""I can't tell you where the world is going, but I can tell you that I think our – the regulatory environment in the US in the banking landscape will likely loosen."",
  ""I would expect that our regulators would look to make our level playing field as level as possible, so that we can continue to compete."",
  ""The Bank of Canada is being constructive, and we can see that rates are going in the right direction."",
  ""This is good for all Canadians."",
  ""It'll increase and improve business sentiment."",
  ""And I think if you take all of that together, we see that as being relatively constructive."",
  ""Now, clearly, there are geopolitical clouds on the horizon."",
  ""What we do control is our strategy and how we go to market and how we build relationships with our clients, and as Hratch quite clearly articulated, we're not competing on price."",
  ""And that matters in the banking business today."",
  ""Good technology, plus good people, delivered in the right value proposition helps you win."",
  ""And in that regard, I think we're well-positioned to benefit from any upside that the market delivers and more than hold our own."",
  ""I think our regulators have always been quite prudential in terms of how they managed our system."",
  ""They're very attuned to what's happening in the rest of the world, including the regulatory environment next door."",
  ""So I won't predict where that's going, but I will say that I think that you can read the tea leaves in the United States in terms of where things are likely to go."",
  ""And I'd like to think that we'll be given the opportunity to continue to compete for business in our own economy as well as in the US economy."",
  ""Yeah, Doug, very good question."",
  ""We're quite clear that we believe in the medium term we can get to 15%-plus."",
  ""That is more than consistent with our Investor Day forecast based on the new capital buffers."",
  ""I mean, I'll let Rob answer that question, but I can tell you strategically, we're very, very focused on improving our ROE over the medium term."",
  ""And you will see that because we're just going to continue to execute on the strategy, which if done right, will deliver that premium ROE."",
  "" for the question, Sohrab."",
  ""So our growth outlook is sort of consistent with what you've heard already today."",
  ""There's some uncertainty out there today."",
  ""We think we're very well-positioned with our clients."",
  ""Our team is ready to respond to the changing environment."",
  ""But when we look at our pipeline, it's strong."",
  ""With the uncertainty out there, it's going to take a bit of time to figure out what the timing of that growth might be over the course of 2025."",
  ""But we feel good about how we are positioned to continue to outperform."",
  ""In terms of the quarter, we had good results this quarter."",
  ""There's some temporary benefits, as Rob talked about, in terms of net interest margin that we benefited from this quarter."",
  ""That'll play through over the next several quarters in terms of coming back down to a more normalized level in the sort of the 350-basis-point range."",
  ""But I'd say, we're in a – from this point forward, we look at our performance from a PPPT perspective as being sort of steady growth going forward."",
  ""So  for your question."",
  ""Clearly, there's a lot of fluidity going on out there in the geopolitical environment."",
  ""Our relationship with the United States is longstanding and important but continuous to evolve."",
  ""So let me just make a couple of comments on that because people may want to know what's on our mind."",
  ""What's on our mind is we should control the controllables as a country."",
  ""And our policymakers should do everything possible to help us drive GDP growth here, because that's as important as benefiting from GDP growth in the United States."",
  ""Things like creating a free trade agreement within our country, providing the incentives for entrepreneurs and capital to be deployed in areas that matter, including AI, technology, healthcare, defense spending within our country in a nascent defense industry, and a clear strategy of regulation that allows businesses to grow and create jobs."",
  ""So that's my message to them."",
  ""All our leaders need to be thinking about that."",
  ""What we think about as a leadership team of CIBC is to continue to stay focused on our clients."",
  ""We believe that there continues to be a robust amount of growth in the Canadian market."",
  ""Yes, we have leadership positions in certain products and services and categories, but we're competing to win in the Canadian market and we will deploy capital in the US market, all in a very balanced way."",
  ""To be strong in the US, you have to be strong at home."",
  ""And therefore, we're going to focus on our Canadian and our US business, and really serve those clients that meet our risk appetite and the value of having a relationship with a bank that helps them achieve their growth ambitions."",
  ""And that will mean growth in Canada, in the consumer, commercial and capital markets and wealth management businesses, as well as our presence in the United States."",
  ""So Meny, really, your question around capital allocation, let me just go back to our principles."",
  ""Our principles are all about organic investment and investment in our platform."",
  ""Organic with a capital O. The second thing is to continue to grow our dividends with earnings."",
  ""And I think we did that again this year as we start on the new fiscal year."",
  ""The third is to use buybacks, as Rob articulated already."",
  ""And when it comes to inorganic, I think we've been quite clear that tuck-in M&A to strengthen our businesses, particularly in the US wealth space, would be something that we have our intent up on."",
  ""But it really is about our organic growth strategy and driving a premium ROE."",
  ""Gabriel, it's a good question."",
  ""I'm not going to speculate on what our regulator will do."",
  ""I will tell you we have a good regulator that manages our banking system for strength and stability."",
  ""And we will react to any policies that they put in place."",
  ""As I said earlier, I think it's really, really important for policymakers across the spectrum to be thinking about how to drive economic growth in Canada, given how the conditions are changing in the United States."",
  ""We don't want to be diverging."",
  ""We don't want to be lagging."",
  ""We don't want the GDP per capita in Canada to decline relative to the US."",
  ""And every decision that helps drive economic growth is something that's welcome."",
  ""And I can tell you that our CIBC leadership team will react to any decision to drive growth in a continued positive way for our clients."",
  ""Rob, anything else for you to add?"",
  ""I think, Gabriel, just over the medium term, that 15%-plus is what we work toward delivering irrespective of the environment."",
  ""I mean, if the environment gets really negative for all banks, then that will be a difficult conversation for everybody."",
  ""But if we assume we have a benign, constructive economic environment, the CIBC leadership team will work toward delivering that 15%-plus."",
  ""And  for all the thoughtful questions you've shared with us this morning."",
  ""I hope the CIBC story and key messages from today have resonated with you."",
  ""We're delivering strong results through consistent execution of our strategy, and we're well-positioned for the years ahead."",
  ""The goal for our investor base has always been to deliver sustainable, relative outperformance over any time horizon."",
  ""And I believe and we believe we're achieving this objective."",
  ""Giving back to our communities is also deeply embedded in the CIBC culture."",
  ""Yesterday marked the 40th anniversary of Miracle Day here in Canada, where our Capital Markets team and Wood Gundy Investment Advisors donated their fees and their commissions for a day to raise money for children in need."",
  ""We've been doing this for over for – almost for four decades and have raised almost CAD 300 million for kids."",
  ""It was a huge success again yesterday, and it's a tradition that we're incredibly proud to support because it reflects the bank that we are."",
  ""Finally, I'd like to close out by extending a sincere  to our entire CIBC team."",
  ""I've always said that banking is a team sport and it's truly our whole team that is driving the momentum to deliver for our clients, for our shareholders, for our communities, and for one another within our bank."",
  ""I want to wish you and all your families a wonderful holiday season."",
  ""I hope you get to recharge the batteries."",
  ""And we look forward to catching up in the New Year."",
  ""Look, I'd like to start by reminding everybody we've got a very client-focused strategy."",
  ""We're distinctly focused on acquiring the right clients where we can build long-term, long-lasting, deep relationships with and provide value both for our clients and our shareholders."",
  ""And so when we look at that mortgage business, we've looked at it through that context, and it really is a key product for our clients."",
  ""However, we've been very surgical in how we've been operating in the mortgage business."",
  ""We've talked openly about the fact that we're not chasing share, and we're not competing on price."",
  ""We're there to serve our clients' needs."",
  ""And we've operated that way this year, balancing client needs against our revenue."",
  ""And when we looked at the beginning of the year, economics were a little bit more challenged and we were more muted in our approach."",
  ""So we served our clients where we have a deep relationship, we compete hard to keep the mortgage or to consolidate the mortgage."",
  ""And where we have less opportunity for a relationship with clients, we're more selective and we have more of an eye towards profitability."",
  ""And so when you put all of that together for this year, we were about 1% growth then the market grew a little bit higher than that."",
  ""But at the same time, we significantly improved our inflow spreads and that allowed us to improve the portfolio spreads."",
  ""And it was one of the contributors to our margin increase over the year, an 18-basis-point improvement in NIM that we had in the business."",
  ""And so we're pleased with how we operated, but we're also looking for opportunities to accelerate."",
  ""And I think you see that towards the end of the year where we saw that better economics."",
  ""We leaned more towards that business and we started being in the mix and So going forward, we see that market accelerating."",
  ""We're going to keep the same surgical approach going into 2025."",
  ""We've seen some really good momentum in volumes as we enter the year."",
  ""And we're prepared to handle that."",
  ""And so from the perspective of renewals, there is a lot of activity coming at us."",
  ""We expect about 70% more volume renewing."",
  ""And we've got technology in place."",
  ""We're getting ahead of it with analytics and we're there to serve our clients and renew their mortgage through that period of time."",
  ""We're also looking at taking advantage of any flows around the market as others with other banks have mortgage needs and those come up for renewal."",
  ""And so we're going to compete there where it makes sense and where we can have a relationship."",
  ""And lastly, we've also scaled up our team."",
  ""We expect new sales activity to be a bit better and we expect some volume from that as well."",
  ""And so we're ready to handle that with a team that's committed and there to serve our clients."",
  ""So we did 13.4% this quarter and 13.7% for the full year."",
  ""So there is some work to do to get to the 15%-plus."",
  ""I'd break it down into a number of things that we're looking at."",
  ""So starting with strategy, as we always do here at CIBC, it is to deepen relationships throughout our bank."",
  ""That should mean better balance on both sides of the balance sheet, and it should mean incremental fee income related to things like wealth management as well."",
  ""We do see better margin performance as I suggested in my prepared remarks."",
  ""Based on the forward curve, we think the margin should be a tailwind for us for the next couple of years."",
  ""The efficiency opportunity, we think, is significant here at CIBC."",
  ""And that's not tactical expense cuts, that's about taking out structural costs and investing the proceeds, some into the bottom line and some into growth."",
  ""We do think loan losses are a little bit elevated and should come down over time."",
  ""And then, more dynamic balance sheet management and you mentioned buybacks definitely factor in."",
  ""We announced the buyback last quarter."",
  ""We started using the buyback last quarter."",
  ""And we intend to deploy that capital fully."",
  ""The 15%-plus, you asked about the capital assumptions, at Investor Day, it was based on an 11.5% CET1 ratio."",
  ""This guidance is closer to the 12.75% to 13% and that allows room, should OSFI decide to use the last 50 basis points that's available to them on the DSB."",
  ""We don't need to change our guidance for that."",
  ""And there's upside if they decide for whatever reason to reduce that capital level."",
  ""So when you put that all together, it really just comes down to the disciplined execution of our strategy, consistent and continuing to do what we're doing, just more of it."",
  ""So yeah, no, we think the margin at the all-bank level and at the Canadian P&C level that stable to gradually higher from here, continues to make sense."",
  ""We've talked in the past about the way we position our balance sheet and the factoring strategy and how that's going to play out, how we expect it to play out based on the forward curve, that consistent upward, gradual trajectory is what we're looking for."",
  ""On the tax rate, so we were 22% effective tax rate this year."",
  ""We disclosed in the MD&A the impact of the global minimum tax is somewhere around 100 basis points for us."",
  ""So the guidance for next year on tax would be in the 23% to 24% range."",
  ""I think that is part of it, but part of it is also the strength we are seeing in our Canadian commercial book, the strength we're seeing in our corporate books."",
  ""That is certainly helping us maintaining our guidance."",
  ""And as I said in my prepared remarks, with some of the economic uncertainties subside, we would expect to be at the lower end of the guidance."",
  ""But it's really a lot of moving parts going into that guidance and a lot of analysis and scenarios."",
  ""And as you said, in part, we do expect the US to come in lower."",
  ""But we also do expect Canadian retail continuing to trend up slightly in line with the macroeconomic development, and then, come down in the latter half of the year."",
  ""I guess, the only thing because, Gabe, you mentioned what do you do with if that DSB changes."",
  ""The reason we said 12.75% to 13% is more – we didn't want to come back here in six months or a year and say, well, we have to revise the guidance again because the minimum has changed."",
  ""We feel like the 12.75% to 13% puts us in a position where there's upside if it comes down, but we're not worried that there's downside if it goes up.""

55,3135904,001C9Z-E,2024-12-04,"[
  ""Appreciate all of you joining us today."",
  ""We demonstrated our continued strong execution towards driving growth and returns above our cost of capital again this quarter."",
  ""We achieved sales growth in the first half of our fiscal year, typically the highest seasonal period, and a record in a quarter for cash generation, which illustrates our disciplined management of working capital on the quarter sales growth and further strengthens our balance sheet, positioning us well as we look into the future."",
  ""As you can see on our slide presentation on page 3, fiscal second quarter 2025 highlights, we delivered great value to our customers with tight efficiencies and cost reductions in our manufacturing areas and consistently meeting project deadlines during the quarter, all while driving forward our strategic and digital transformations."",
  ""During the quarter, we completed innovative and visually striking installations at the L.A. Clippers Intuit Dome, the Miami HEAT's Kaseya Center, numerous college and high school sporting facilities, and upgraded many commercial locations to the latest digital technologies."",
  ""Our sales growth and careful working capital management drove cash flows from operations of $43.3 million for the fiscal second quarter, and $62.8 million for the first half of the year."",
  ""Additionally, we made strong progress along our stated digital transformation road map with work toward the launch of our enterprise performance management tools and upgrades of our service and systems maintenance solutions set to go live as planned in the second half of the fiscal year."",
  ""In addition, we are working to enhance and add new show control capabilities."",
  ""Our show controls software solution provides dynamic, seamless and fully immersive game day and event production."",
  ""It is really exciting to see the first ever Flame Ball Centerhung installation at the Miami Heat."",
  ""Building first of its kind creations using LED technology is something that drives our company forward and excites our employees."",
  ""Bringing this iconic sculpture to life for the Miami Heat, the Kaseya Center, and their audiences is a great engineering feat that we are proud to have accomplished."",
  ""We look forward to providing other customers similar types of creations to amaze their fans and audiences."",
  ""In addition to the record generation of cash, we delivered a solid second quarter and first half year of financial performance, growing revenue 4.5% to $208 million at 26.8% gross margins and earning a 9.2% adjusted operating margin for the quarter."",
  ""Backlog is at $236 million, declining as planned as we move into our seasonally lower volume third quarter."",
  ""As you will recall, our third quarter is historically lower because fall sports installations have been completed, there is a natural slowdown of outdoor construction projects, and we have two major holidays in the period, reducing the overall days of production."",
  ""Because of these dynamics and the reality many of our costs are more fixed in the near-term, operating margins are often lower in our fiscal third quarter."",
  ""The management team activates different mitigation strategies to reduce costs during this time, such as reduction in shifts, and utilize this capacity to focus teams on revenue generation and overall improvement activities."",
  ""Sheila will further discuss financial results later in the call."",
  ""But first, please turn to slide 4 market vertical FQ2 review for more details."",
  ""In Live Events, in addition to the installations already highlighted, we completed delivery for several large projects, which included Centerhung video, ribbon boards and other cutting edge displays to provide innovative, great game day experiences in various arenas and stadiums."",
  ""Customers entrusting Daktronics included University of Connecticut, University of Kansas, The LA Lakers' Crypto.com Arena, Our outlook for this segment remains similar to our last call, we expect Live Events demand to remain strong as venues enhance facilities to entertain fans and attract athletes."",
  ""Orders in this market are large and installations can be lengthy and complex, and therefore creates variability in period to period order and sales volumes."",
  ""As we plan for each season, we liken each to a graduating class, with each year having a certain number of new systems and potential upgrades or replacements."",
  ""Some class sizes are larger or smaller with individual owners or customers determining when their projects will move forward."",
  ""As we evaluate the current class of available projects in the near-term, we now expect Spring Baseball Project orders to be a smaller class as a number of potential upgrades have moved out to future seasons."",
  ""As we look ahead, we continue to expect healthy demand for in the ball applications and expansion into outside the ball as more focus is being placed on entertainment areas, spaces like entryways, atriums, concourses and adjacent entertainment zones."",
  ""Our Narrow Pixel Pitch line of products matches the needs of customers for many of these locations and continues to be in demand."",
  ""Our commercial business primarily consists of sales through resellers, mainly signed companies, to many types of customers and applications, including military, utilities, transportation, national retailers, quick serve restaurants, casinos, shopping centers, cruise ships, commercial building owners, petroleum retailers and other not on premise customers."",
  ""Also included in this segment are out-of-home advertising companies and larger advertising displays called spectaculars."",
  ""Orders can vary in this market also because of the larger size orders in these two segments."",
  ""During the quarter, we secured a large project for The Center, formerly known as the CNN Center in Atlanta, which drove the order volume increases."",
  ""In addition, out-of-home orders increased as a result of our continued strategies to promote to independent out-of-home operators and serve the large national out-of-home advertisers, winning us additional orders."",
  ""Our focus for this market is to grow our core areas and continue to build out our AV integrator network to market our Narrow Pixel Pitch product lines, especially in control room applications used by military, utility and transportation agencies."",
  ""As an example, during the quarter we were successful in a sale of an NPP product through an AV channel for use at the George H.W. Bush Library."",
  ""This slide also includes a picture of an installation at Quantico marine base, a testament to our focus on the military AV channel and the use of NPP products for multiple applications."",
  ""In our transportation market, variability in orders versus prior periods is natural in this segment, which is a large project business and therefore lumpy."",
  ""Despite the down order comparison, our financial performance for this segment was solid as we fulfilled a backlog of orders from long time repeat customers, including one at our Sioux Falls Regional Airport."",
  ""We continue to see a trend in upgrades in and around airports for digital signage."",
  ""Our teams are focused on winning projects for intelligent transportation systems, including traffic management centers, airport projects and other mass transit system projects."",
  ""The outlook for this segment remains solid and is poised to take advantage of selling our full line of video display systems from our NPP products to our pre-qualified and trusted ITS systems used by state and city governments."",
  ""International, during the quarter, we were awarded a number of contracts in the out-of-home space in Saudi Arabia and Australia."",
  ""While orders continue to be slow as compared to prior years, which we believe continues to reflect economic and geopolitical uncertainty, we are actively quoting opportunities to additional out-of-home customers and for several mid-sized sports products and continue to see signs of converting more quotes into orders with our existing customer base and a focus on these types of new orders from a broad array of customers, we are laying the groundwork for future repeat and upgrade types of orders in the future."",
  ""The picture displayed on this slide is for an NPP product installation in Singapore."",
  ""In addition, customers value our product designs tailored specifically to their unique needs, as evidenced by a strong response to our EcoSmart energy savings product, which is desired by our energy sensitive customers."",
  ""In high schools, the market continues to convert to full video usage, which drove the increase in orders for the quarter."",
  ""We began deliveries of our new higher margin product to not only support our customers but further bolster our contribution margin for this segment."",
  ""The pictured installation at Warren Harding High School in Ohio is one example of the number of high schools upgrading outdoor installations to video displays."",
  ""And increasingly, demand has grown for full video usage indoors as well."",
  ""As mentioned a moment ago, with respect to our show control software, we continue to make progress on our major enhancements of control systems to enhance the live event experience and improve workflow efficiencies."",
  ""These enhancements will empower our customers to deliver dynamic presentations using cutting edge scoring and timing software, 3D data visualizations, real time rendering and integrated data through sports specific applications."",
  ""The addressable market for our new solution is broad, including anyone supporting live events, entertainment and sports even if they're not using Daktronics displays, and is slated for release by fiscal year end."",
  ""Additionally, we are introducing cloud access, allowing customers to schedule, store and manage their content and data sources from anywhere."",
  ""The work that we are doing here sets us up nicely to increase our recurring revenue streams, which we intend to be a driver for gross margin expansion over time."",
  ""As Sheila will detail in a moment, during the second half of the year, we are set for two major internal technology launches at the core of our digital transformation roadmap."",
  ""These launches are the building blocks of the future foundation for which we will service our customers, measure our performance and manage the overall business."",
  ""We will also continue to develop our overall comprehensive transformation efforts through the rest of the fiscal year, refining our transformation initiatives and making selected investments in transformational actions designed to drive future years revenue growth, profitability and sustainable returns in the mid to upper teens for ROIC."",
  ""I will discuss this more after a bit."",
  ""But first, for additional details on the financial results for the quarter and the year, I'll turn it over to Sheila."",
  ""We're also making investments to drive profitable growth and accelerate the lowering of our overall structural and product costs to increase market competitiveness."",
  ""Not only do we see the digital transformation efforts as foundational to lowering our structural costs, but we are also investing in people capabilities and working with consultants to accelerate those strategies."",
  ""Finally, we continue to execute on strategies to both grow and capture greater share of our SAM."",
  ""These strategies include advancing our control system capabilities, as I previously mentioned, and adding professional services and other content to drive MRR, ensuring we are delivering enhanced returns as we help our customers achieve success in their investment offerings."",
  ""Turning to slide 8 titled FY 2025 strategic priorities, we continue to execute on our business transformation plan, the goal of which is to grow revenue faster than the company's addressable market, expand operating margins, and generate returns on capital in the mid to high teens and consistently above the company's cost of capital."",
  ""During the quarter, we made significant progress in a number of areas, including new show control capabilities, enterprise management tools and upgrades to service and system maintenance solutions, which are set to go live in the second half of the fiscal year."",
  ""Key components of this program include executing on our digital transformation initiatives, carefully allocating resources to end market segments, prioritizing investments in areas which Daktronics has clear advantages and opportunities for above market growth at acceptable margins, aligning product delivery with differing customer needs through a tiered product offering strategy with pricing aligned with the value delivered, achieving higher profit by reducing product input costs and focusing on efficiency improvements in manufacturing and other operations, maximizing balance sheet efficiencies and refining our critical business and financial management practices, including product pricing, business planning and incentive compensation to fully support our performance objectives."",
  ""In terms of our process, during the first quarter, we conducted a data driven analysis to identify numerous actionable opportunities to accelerate our profitable growth."",
  ""In the second quarter, we launched a deeper initiative to further analyze, plan, prioritize and roadmap specific initiatives."",
  ""We are nearing the conclusion of this planning and choosing phase and can highlight some early learnings and initiatives."",
  ""To date, we have gained insights on our customer relationships and perceptions in the market."",
  ""These insights confirmed we are aligning to the trends and needs of customers with our concentration on quality service and control system capabilities."",
  ""We will continue to identify and adapt to market trends and buying behaviors and product needs to focus on product quality and reliability, services and support, and control system capabilities."",
  ""We have also found areas of opportunity for improved performance and are planning to reinvigorate our lean management practices and supplier management."",
  ""We have identified opportunities in portfolio and management approaches to the market, pricing strategies, product and production costs."",
  ""Our teams are examining the breadth and complexity of our offerings and are evaluating ways to reduce cost to produce and install."",
  ""Our teams are doing a great job in using data driven strategy and proven methodologies to plan and prioritize value enabling initiatives."",
  ""We will continue our digital transformation initiatives, including our enterprise performance management system implementation and modernize service tools and we'll begin executing our back end and customer facing roadmap during the back half of the fiscal year."",
  ""These initiatives are expecting to add more resilience to our operations in reacting to changing operating environments and will result in above SAM revenue growth and mid to high teens return on capital."",
  ""We are refining our forward looking plans with the intention to report on actions no later than our Q3 call, we expect to capture the quickly realized benefit of this effort in the second half of FY 2025, with additional benefits to be realized as we complete implementation by the end of FY 2026."",
  ""In conclusion, our summary on slide 8 (sic) [slide 9] recaps our key highlights."",
  ""Our consistent performance serves as evidence we are on a sustainable trajectory of growth and increasing profitability."",
  ""Our multi-year transformational strategies and near-term progress on these goals demonstrates our commitment to improve and consistently earn returns above the cost of capital and in the top range of our industry."",
  ""We are focused on the right allocation of resources and capturing growth in existing profitable SAM and developing growth in additional areas."",
  ""We are focused on accelerating digital transformations and other initiatives to lower structural and product costs."",
  ""We are a global industry leader in best in class video communication displays and control systems, and we continue to focus on bringing value to our customers."",
  ""We are the only US manufacturer of scale with a global footprint servicing by geographic market and consistently demonstrate world leading technology leadership, high quality solutions and world class service."",
  ""With that, I would ask the operator to please open the line for any questions."",
  "" for participating in our second quarter  call."",
  ""I would like to review our disclosure cautioning investors and participants that in addition to statements of historical fact, we will be discussing forward-looking statements reflecting our expectations and plans about our future financial performance and future business opportunities."",
  ""These forward-looking statements reflect the company's expectations or beliefs concerning future events."",
  ""All forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations."",
  ""Such risks include, but are not limited to, changes in economic and market conditions, management of growth, timing and magnitude of future contracts and orders, fluctuations in market margins, the introduction of new products and technology, availability and cost of raw materials, components and shipping services, geopolitical and governmental actions, and other important factors."",
  ""These identified factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in this call in the company's second quarter 2025 quarterly  and its most recent annual report on Form 10-K. Our second quarter 2025  contains certain non-GAAP financial measures and was furnished to the SEC Securities and Exchange Commission on a Form 8-K this morning."",
  ""We also made slides available for today's call."",
  ""All these documents are available on the investors section at Daktronics website www.daktronics.com."",
  ""I'll turn the call over to our CEO, Reece Kurtenbach."",
  "", Reece, I invite you to turn to slide 5 and 6 titled fiscal quarter two and year-to-date fiscal 2025 financial highlights to follow the second quarter and first half of the year's financial outcome."",
  ""The quarter-over-quarter comparisons in this slide and related discussion are as of and for the quarters ended October 26, 2024, July 27, 2024 and October 28, 2023, unless otherwise stated."",
  ""Order volume for the quarter declined primarily due to the order decreases in Live Events, Transportation and International business units."",
  ""Variability in orders comparatively is natural in these large project business areas and the time of year for sports projects."",
  ""These declines were offset by large project bookings in the spectacular area and end of calendar year purchases by our out-of-home customers in the Commercial business unit and were offset by solid growth in the High School Park and Recreation business unit because of the market's adoption towards the use of video displays."",
  ""Orders for the first half of the year increased 3.3%."",
  ""Based on the strong return to more normal seasonal trends as compared to prior year, product backlog level was $236 million at the end of the quarter."",
  ""Quoting activity remains active across all segments."",
  ""The quarter's sales increase was a result of comparatively higher volumes in Live Events and Transportation business units, offset by lower sales levels in the International business unit."",
  ""Sales in our Commercial and High School Park and Recreation business units were relatively flat."",
  ""This mix difference is the result of variability of orders as described."",
  ""With the higher levels of sales in Q2 2025, we generated similar sales to last year's record level on a year-to-date comparison."",
  ""Gross profit percentage of net sales decreased slightly to 26.8% for the second quarter of fiscal 2025, as compared to 27.2% a year ago."",
  ""This solid gross profit level is a reflection of volume, mix, some price improvement and careful management of manufacturing and service fulfillment costs."",
  ""On a year-to-date basis, gross profit of 26.6% as compared to 29% is attributable to the sales mix differences between periods."",
  ""We continue to generate operating income consistently through the last five quarters in the high single digits."",
  ""Operating income was 7.6% of sales in Q2, and as adjusted for onetime consulting related expenses, was 9.2%."",
  ""On a year-to-date basis, it was 8.8% or 9.8%, as adjusted."",
  ""Operating expense increases reflected the investments in staffing to support our digital transformation and future sales growth initiatives and salary and wages increases."",
  ""During the second quarter, we also incurred $3.2 million in non-recurring consulting services to help us implement and accelerate our strategies to grow and drive efficiencies and consistent profitability levels."",
  ""We expect to invest up to $5 million to $6 million more during fiscal 2025 for the business and digital transformation initiatives."",
  ""Our sales growth and careful working capital management drove record cash flows from operations of $43.3 million for the second quarter and $62.8 million for the first half of the year."",
  ""Cash, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $134.4 million at the end of the quarter, and our working capital grew to $243.7 million, with a working capital ratio of 2.3 to 1."",
  ""Management's focus remains on maintaining the strong balance sheet and on managing working capital through the expected growth of the company."",
  ""As previously announced, we have delivered Alta Fox the notice of conversion of the initial $7 million in face value of the $25 million senior secured line promissory notes on November 11, 2024, with a conversion date of yesterday, December 3, 2024."",
  ""We intend to convert the remainder of the convertible notes over the next several months in tranches of up to $7 million in face value every 30 days, as provided for in the convertible notes."",
  ""The company will deliver shares when Alta Fox certifies that delivery of shares will not cause its ownership to exceed the maximum percentage, currently at 3% and will increase to 14.99% in late January."",
  ""The conversion, when completed, will save $5.4 million of interest over the remaining term."",
  ""To offset the share dilution that will result from the conversion of these notes into common stock, we intend to execute on our existing share repurchase authorization as soon as practical."",
  ""Given our financial performance, our view of market growth and our strong positioning in the market, and with the strategic initiatives we're undertaking, we are well-positioned to drive profitability and cash flow generation through the remainder of fiscal 2025 and beyond."",
  ""Now, please turn to slide 7 titled fiscal year 2025 digital transformation and strategic priorities."",
  ""On the digital transformation front, as we previously discussed, we're investing in foundational enterprise performance management tools that will strengthen our management systems and improve data availability to guide capital allocation decisions and focus our investments in the most profitable business areas."",
  ""We are on track for our phased implementation of these integrated business planning tools and processes and to achieve the value these tools provide."",
  ""First up is our consolidation reporting tools implementation, testing and training has started."",
  ""In addition, we made progress on design and data collection of information needed for integrated business planning."",
  ""This configuration, data gathering and testing is set to be completed by the end of the fiscal year and utilized beginning fiscal 2026 to better align our strategic, operational and financial planning."",
  ""We also made substantial progress in testing and creating deployment plans for the launch of our modernized service systems and management tools."",
  ""These tools will both improve our internal operations and customer experiences as we expect this application to go live by the end of our fiscal year."",
  ""We started planning for the automation in our front end quoting and sales processes, which we plan to launch in phases beginning in fiscal 2026."",
  ""These investments in digital transformation are expected to improve customer experiences, drive operational excellence and help us leverage our operations as we grow the business and grow our profitability."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it back to Reece to provide an overview for the other areas of strategic focus.""
]","[
  ""And  for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter here."",
  ""So, given that the second quarter was a lot better than we had expected and given your prior commentary about you expecting to be in line with consensus on the full year, do you expect a more steeper decline in revenue for the second half than we had before?"",
  ""Or how should we think about that seasonality?"",
  ""And in terms of the gross margins, they have held up pretty nicely over the last couple of quarters."",
  ""I understand now when we go into a more softer season in the second half, they might be coming down."",
  ""But how should we think about those gross margins for next year?"",
  ""And you also mentioned the e-sales channel that you have launched."",
  ""How do you see that trending and how do you expect that to affect margins as per growth?"",
  ""And it seems like your operating expenses are going to be a bit inflated this year by the consulting fees you're spending on the digital transformation."",
  ""So, do you expect to contain paying consulting fees in next year or should we expect margins maybe to have a positive effect from that falling off?"",
  ""And last one for me before I get back into queue."",
  ""With a new administration coming in and their sort of approach to the tariffs, how do you think that might affect Daktronics?"",
  ""That was all for me."",
  ""This is Mac Furst with Singular Research."",
  ""And  for taking my question."",
  ""So, with the new administration taking office in January, what other changes do you expect following kind of the question that the previous analyst raised?"",
  ""You produce in China Yeah,  very much, Reece."",
  "" for answering my question."",
  "" for pointing that out."",
  ""Yeah, again, congratulations on the quarter."",
  ""Once again, Anja, we have a large project business, so revenue can be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, but we do expect overall for the fiscal year that our orders and sales will be on par or exceed last year's."",
  ""I think we're winning our fair share of orders at the pricing that we've set in the marketplace, so I think in third quarter it's more of a volume situation than a price compression on certain projects."",
  ""We have continued to grow our e-sales channel, but it's really on small standard, very standard types of orders."",
  ""You might think of shot clocks that are in a high school basketball facility."",
  ""And we intend to continue to grow that into back half of this fiscal year as well as in future fiscal years."",
  ""That should bring the selling cost down on every one of those orders and allow the sales teams that we have to focus on higher value, more complex sales."",
  ""So, we believe that overall revenue will continue to grow, the gross margins on those products, we will be able to maintain those, and the selling costs overall for a unit like that should become more efficient."",
  ""Yeah, we have two major initiatives, a business transformation initiative and a digital transformation."",
  ""The business transformation should be contained to this year, and much of our digital transformation will be in this year, but some of the initiatives such as our configure price quoting and sales efficiency initiatives we believe will start in fiscal 2026 Q1 and continue through fiscal 2026, possibly even into FY 2027."",
  ""And those might have some consulting fees and other costs associated with them as we work through those really exciting but can be challenging initiatives."",
  ""Well, that's a great question."",
  ""I wish I had better insight into what the new administration is going to do, but obviously, we source a lot of semiconductors and a lot of semiconductors and related materials such as printed circuit cards are sourced outside the US and we bring into either our US factories or one of our factories outside the US and then bring the finished product in and so tariffs will impact those products."",
  ""How much depends on the specific actions taken, and is difficult to predict."",
  ""Appreciate you on the call today."",
  ""Appreciate you on the call today."",
  ""Yeah, once again, lots of activity in that front right now, it appears that there'll be changes in the tariffs potentially and different regulations or the regulation environment or the regulatory environment, but too soon to really predict or to make a estimate on what we might change in our operations to account for that."",
  ""I think I understood most of you, you broke up a little bit there, Mac, but let me try."",
  ""We do have a factory in Shanghai, China, and we produce really some nice products there, some of which come into the US, but much of which goes to countries outside the US."",
  ""We also have another factory in Ireland where we produce products that sometimes come to the US, and once again, to many countries outside the US."",
  ""And we have our major production in kind of the South Dakota, central Minnesota area of the US, of which we source many semiconductor items like LEDs, the ICs to turn those LEDs on and off, power supplies and other components."",
  ""And we source some of those through China and some from other companies outside of China."",
  ""But China is a huge player in the semiconductor market, and so they have some influence on the overall pricing and availability of many components."",
  ""And those will be impacted by tariffs, certainly from China and possibly from other countries, depending on how broadly tariffs are applied by the next administration."",
  ""And may I point out, Mac, that most of our competition produces outside the US and China, Southern China, so it won't be necessarily a competitive disadvantage because they will be in the same sort of environment."",
  ""And we do have an advantage that we can bring in components and add value in the US, which is unusual in our industry."",
  ""We have the largest and really the biggest manufacturing facility in the US."",
  ""Appreciate everybody attending today's call and the nice words from Mac and Anja about the quarter."",
  ""We do have investor outreach activities planned for the next quarter, including here in December, there's a Benchmark Discovery Conference and a Singular conference and we'll be attending both of those."",
  ""And we'll also, of course, host the next earning call at the end of our Q3 when we release results."",
  ""Appreciate all you joining us today."",
  ""I hope you have a great holiday season."",
  ""I look forward to seeing you in February.""

  ""And , everyone, for joining us today."",
  ""This morning, we filed our Form 10-Q with the SEC and issued a press release that provided our financial results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2024, along with key business accomplishments."",
  ""As a brief overview for today's call, I'll start by discussing our third quarter performance and highlighting our progress toward our three-year financial goals."",
  ""I'll then pass the call to Mike to discuss our financial results."",
  ""Afterward, I'll return to discuss recent updates within our key target markets, product developments, and our go-to-market strategies."",
  ""I'd like to begin by reaffirming our three-year financial and operational goals, which are central to our overall strategy."",
  ""These objectives include maintaining our strong position in Live Production while accelerating growth in the MilGov sector in our recurring revenue services business, with the intent to achieve cash flow positivity in 2025."",
  ""We are pleased to report that our year-to-date revenue has increased over 26% compared to the prior year."",
  ""The results recorded in the third quarter alone reflected a temporary decline in revenues compared to the prior year, primarily caused by unusually high seasonal softness in the Live Production sector."",
  ""We believe this is primarily driven by broadcasters focusing on the 2024 Summer Olympics, which led to several non-Olympics projects being put on hold."",
  ""We also experienced some delays in procurement activities for new programs in the Middle East region due to heightened alert status caused by regional geopolitical tensions."",
  ""We expect these activities to return to their usual pace in the coming months."",
  ""This quarter brought several encouraging developments, signaling strong growth opportunities ahead."",
  ""Bookings within the MilGov sector continued to gain momentum, fueled by increased demand for our solutions."",
  ""We currently have numerous field product evaluations underway across local, national, and international law enforcement and defense agencies."",
  ""This reflects our strategic commitment to ensuring public safety and maintaining a tactical edge."",
  ""Our airborne video downlink systems, powered by the industry leading AeroLink transceiver and the Air-to-Anywhere solution, continue to set the benchmark for unparalleled reliability, efficiency, and performance in surveillance and emergency response."",
  ""We take pride in having our downlink solutions deployed in some of the most demanding and high-profile environments around the world."",
  ""Recently, we initiated a deployment of our systems with the US Department of Homeland Security."",
  ""We also secured an order from the DC Metro Police Department, and our technology is set to play a key role in supporting law enforcement at the 2025 G7 Summit in Alberta, Canada."",
  ""Additionally, we received a major order in Brazil for our downlink solution, which will be used for police and surveillance operations, utilizing our bonded cellular technology."",
  ""With expanding opportunities across global MilGov markets, including the US, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, we are well-positioned to build on this momentum and drive significant revenue growth in the coming months and years."",
  ""In the third quarter, we launched a new ERP system to unify and optimize our core operations, driving greater efficiency across the organization."",
  ""This system enables us to initiate a restructuring program to reduce significant cost delivering annualized savings of over $6 million starting in Q4."",
  ""While we are pleased with our year-to-date revenue growth, we've proactively responded to signs of near-term revenue softness by consolidating operations and strategically positioning ourselves for continued growth in the MilGov sector."",
  ""As part of this effort, we are consolidating our manufacturing facilities into a single location and streamlining our organization to better support our target markets."",
  ""These actions are designed to eliminate underperforming product lines, optimize staffing, and align our resources with the company's long-term objectives."",
  ""We remain committed to identifying additional opportunities for cost reduction."",
  ""Before I proceed with further updates, I'll pass the call over to our CFO, Mike Bond, to provide a detailed overview of our financial results for the third quarter."",
  ""Our MilGov markets remain on a strong growth trajectory."",
  ""Our strategic initiatives to grow in this market continue to bear fruit."",
  ""Currently, half of our sales funnel with a 40% or higher probability are MilGov opportunities."",
  ""This represents a significant shift for a market that historically accounted for less than 30% of our revenue."",
  ""It is important to note that this is not a result of a decline in our Live Production funnel."",
  ""Opportunities in both markets continue to grow."",
  ""We project over $9 million in MilGov bookings for 2024, which would represent year-over-year growth of over 60%."",
  ""Our success in the MilGov sector is driven by our airborne downlink systems, which are market leaders in delivering real-time video intelligence for critical missions."",
  ""AeroLink, our aircraft-based transmission unit, has become the cornerstone of our downlink solution."",
  ""In fact, the growing popularity of AeroLink is helping drive sales of other components in our downlink system."",
  ""Once law enforcement and defense organizations experience the enhanced image quality, lower latency, and other capabilities of AeroLink, it often leads them to upgrade their ground infrastructure, and other components of the transmit and receive systems, including migration to our Air-to-Anywhere secure streaming platform, ensuring optimal situational awareness for all stakeholders."",
  ""Further, the release of our Aero5 bonded cellular solution addresses the needs of those customers interested in leveraging of public cellular infrastructure."",
  ""We believe the drone public safety and defense industry is well-positioned for growth, driven by increased defense spending and formalized policy."",
  ""Enhanced investment in R&D for autonomous systems and secure communication technologies will drive innovation, positioning companies to lead in advancing global security and uncrewed solutions."",
  ""We view this as an exciting trend and believe that the increased investment we've made in Drone Command and Control positions us to capitalize on emerging opportunities in the sector."",
  ""We are taking steps to enhance our visibility as a thought leader in the sector of uncrewed communications and to engage more with key players in the market."",
  ""Turning to our services capability, we continue to focus on driving more recurring revenue through service level agreements for 24/7 support, depot repair, and software upgrades."",
  ""Less than 10% of our product base is covered by an SLA."",
  ""We see tremendous upside in this area and will continue to invest to create a capability to support our global customer base."",
  ""In December, we will introduce the LinkMatrix v2, which will provide a secure, user-friendly interface to communicate and diagnose not only our cellular products, but our entire product portfolio."",
  ""This will enable our service teams to remotely diagnose, manage, and provide software updates to all Vislink customers."",
  ""Going forward, we plan to continue targeted R&D investments, introducing incremental enhancements, and major upgrades to sustain our competitive advantage."",
  ""Among the noteworthy installations in our Live Production area in Q3, we won several bids from news agencies for airborne downlink systems featuring the AeroLink transmitter."",
  ""In these cases, our downlink systems will use to deliver aerial coverage for breaking news and sports."",
  ""This highlights how we are leveraging our expertise in supporting complex military and public safety missions to provide the During the quarter, we secured a bid for a bonded cellular transmission system to support live telecasts of Mexico's Supreme Court."",
  ""Additionally, our bonded cellular solutions were deployed to cover the elections in the country of Georgia at the end of October."",
  ""We also won a project to upgrade Malaysia's national broadcaster, enhancing live news and sports coverage."",
  ""Overall, international quoting activity remains strong, and we expect continued robust contributions to our global revenues from non-North American markets."",
  ""Our go-to-market strategy is continually evolving, yielding encouraging outcomes across our four primary focus areas; live video connectivity, video/data transport, AVDS, and Drone C2."",
  ""Progress in Drone C2 has been especially notable."",
  ""While still an emerging sector, we anticipate a rapid expansion in coming years, particularly related to border security and a focus on American-made defense platforms."",
  ""Our bonded cellular technology continues to be a cornerstone for live video connectivity and video/data transport, providing reliable, high-quality video transmission for a wide range of applications."",
  ""We are strengthening collaborations with key OEM partners to ensure our technology roadmap aligns with our evolving needs, further solidifying our leadership, and meeting market demands."",
  ""We look forward to engaging with companies in emerging technology fields such as virtual and augmented reality, and artificial intelligence where our live video transmission technology can unlock new commercial applications and drive growth."",
  ""Our collaboration with FocalPoint VR on the A2RL, Abu Dhabi Autonomous Racing League is a prime example of this, and has earned several awards for its innovation."",
  ""Looking ahead, we remain committed to our three-year strategy."",
  ""Though we may adjust the timeline to reflect the evolving market landscape, we have recalibrated our cost structure to align with this extended timeframe."",
  ""With strong, ongoing demand for our trusted solutions, a shift toward high-margin service revenue, and a continued focus on cost efficiency, we are confident in our ability to execute our strategy and achieve sustainable, profitable growth over the long term."",
  ""We appreciate your continued support and confidence in Vislink."",
  ""We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress in the coming quarters."",
  ""Operator, please provide the appropriate instructions."",
  ""Looking at our financial results for the third quarter, revenue in the third quarter was $7.1 million compared to $7.2 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2024, was $24.4 million, an increase of 26% over the prior period."",
  ""Gross margin was 51%, that's down from 54% in the prior-year period."",
  ""Net loss for the quarter was $3 million or a negative $1.22 per share."",
  ""That compares to a loss of $2 million or a negative $0.83 per share in the prior-year period."",
  ""This was the result of lower-than-expected revenue in the quarter and higher fixed costs across the organization."",
  ""Total expenses were $10.3 million compared to $9.5 million in the prior-year period."",
  ""Our Q3 expenses reflected an increase in costs associated with personnel required for the ERP implementation, which ramped up during the quarter, as well as higher expenditures for strategic R&D investments."",
  ""Turning to our profitability measures."",
  ""Operating loss was a negative $3.3 million compared to a loss of $2.3 million in the prior-year period."",
  ""Net loss attributable to common shareholders was a negative $3 million or a negative $1.22 per share compared to a loss of $2 million or a negative $0.83 per share in the prior-year period."",
  ""Moving to our balance sheet."",
  ""As of September 30, 2024, our cash and short-term investments stood at $9.2 million, compared to $11.5 million at June 30, 2024."",
  ""Working capital was $27.1 million at the end of third quarter, compared to $31.8 million at June 30, 2024."",
  ""The company expects to see improving working capital performance in the coming periods, primarily due to better vendor terms through consolidated purchasing, shorter installation, and customer acceptance periods for large systems implementations, and better inventory management, all driven by the new ERP system implemented in the third quarter."",
  ""That concludes my prepared remarks and I'll now turn it back to Mickey.""
]","[
  "" so much for taking my questions."",
  ""I may have missed it."",
  ""Did you share the total pipeline?"",
  ""I guess, I was wondering if it's been impacted by some of your short-term challenges."",
  ""If we could start with MilGov business."",
  ""In prepared remarks, you mentioned it was lower than expected."",
  ""You commented there was a MilGov order in the Middle East that was delayed."",
  ""How big was this order and what are your expectations based on discussions as at least it doesn't appear the heightened tensions in that area are ending any time soon."",
  ""And then, can you talk about the pipeline you mentioned in MilGov about half?"",
  ""I think the goal was to eliminate shortfalls due to one order being delayed obviously."",
  ""So are there are a dozen opportunities in there?"",
  ""Are there many more than that?"",
  ""I'm just trying to understand the diversification of that pipeline?"",
  "", and then lastly, on MilGov."",
  ""Can you quantify the percentage of revenue actually in the third quarter?"",
  ""I know you gave some rough numbers, and what it historically has been, but maybe a third quarter number might be helpful to understand the growth trajectory of the entire business."",
  ""And then moving to live entertainment, here we are five months after the Olympics."",
  ""Are you starting to see a pickup?"",
  ""And is that more first half of the year and we'll see another sluggish fourth quarter?"",
  ""Just, kind of, maybe help with timing and expectations for investors."",
  ""And last question, you started the answer that $6 million is a large number to cover your business."",
  ""Are you moving to one or two production facilities?"",
  ""And then how much is that reduced footprint saving versus people or maybe anything else that you're doing?"",
  ""Just doing the math here quickly."",
  ""When you say $800,000 for the facilities, is that per quarter, given that adds up?"",
  ""You didn't miss it, Brian."",
  ""The pipeline is above where we were last."",
  ""I think we shared it at $48 million."",
  ""We're around $50 million related pipeline right now."",
  ""As we mentioned after that, above 40% of MilGov opportunities, which we think is very positive, given that, traditionally, was a less than 30% revenue source for us."",
  ""So we continue to see opportunities on the Live Production side as well."",
  ""So it's not that those are going down."",
  ""We just saw, in this quarter, some softness on the Live Production side."",
  ""And a lot of it had to do with a lot of customers who were busy for a month-and-a-half in Paris with the Olympics."",
  ""Yeah, that's a good point."",
  ""We had – in August, we had a demonstration of the new technology that we'll work with."",
  ""This is a customer that particular that you're talking about is a customer where we're already embedded incumbent source, where they have over 200 rotary helicopters and fixed wing, as well as multiple receive sites to cover the entire country."",
  ""In August, that was delayed."",
  ""We're seeing signs that that will pick up in the early part of next year to be able to do that demonstration, and trial, and proceed with executing on that project."",
  ""So we're expecting about six-month delay on that."",
  ""Just to give you an example."",
  ""In this past year alone, Baltimore, so we deployed Baltimore City, but just looking at history and then we'll talk about the future."",
  ""We deployed Baltimore City, Baltimore County, the New Jersey State Police."",
  ""We mentioned DC Metro on this call."",
  ""We also got our first initial opportunity with Department of Homeland Security."",
  ""So, we've got quite a track record of high profile, very meaningful customer engagements that have resulted in success."",
  ""And we're building on that because most recently, we got an order from the Danish MOD."",
  ""And so, we're seeing pick up not only here in the US with state and local, which is going to strong point for us, but through our acquisition of BMS."",
  ""Now, we're having a much greater exposure to Middle Eastern, European, and Asian opportunities where they were incumbents."",
  ""And that's where we're seeing the big opportunities that traditionally weren't part of the Vislink portfolio of customers."",
  ""Brian, just proportionately, out of the $7 million we did, Live Production was $4.4 million, and MilGov was $1.8 million, and then we had some service revenue in there for $700 million."",
  ""I think, Brian, we're seeing a pickup in quoting and processing activity, that's for sure."",
  ""We had a good start to this quarter."",
  ""But again, we expect some of this will be back end loaded."",
  ""So we will have a sluggish fourth quarter."",
  ""One of the reasons we took proactive restructuring activity, just to point out on that, when we saw around margins, we had acquired BMS last year, with that we acquired the BMS production facility, and then, we also had two production facilities within Vislink."",
  ""And so, now we've consolidated to a single facility."",
  ""That's to allow us to obviously improve our conversion cost, to improve our management of inventory."",
  ""So we expect to weather through this next quarter."",
  ""But we're looking back to the, kind of, growth that we were looking at the beginning of the year in this quarter."",
  ""Got a good start in October."",
  ""And we hope to finish strong in December."",
  ""But much of that will be for deliverables next year."",
  ""Yeah, we're ready to move one, and Mike can give you the details."",
  "", Chris, and , everyone, for joining us today."",
  ""We look forward to continue to build this company and deliver those returns that you expect."",
  ""We're taking out costs associated with two facilities."",
  ""One we're taking out completely."",
  ""Those costs are around $800,000, and they'll come out in the next, I would say, the next quarter, fourth quarter or first quarter of next year."",
  ""And then we're taking out a significant number of head count."",
  ""And just that $6 million, the head count alone is $3.7 million."",
  ""And the majority of that is either notified, and is leaving the business now or will leave in the fourth quarter with some remainder in the first quarter of next year."",
  ""But the vast majority will be going out at the end of fourth quarter."",
  ""That's alleviation of rent, taxes, utilities, things like that."",
  ""And then we've got other expenses that we're cutting in the business."",
  ""That will total out to probably another $1.1 million that will come out over time, over the remainder of next year."",
  ""There'll be a ratable reduction in our run rate.""

  ""And lastly, the new executive board team is in place now at Aurubis with my colleague Steffen Hoffmann, but also with Inge Hofkens and Tim Kurth."",
  ""During this eventful last year, we stayed focused and made good progress on our strategic agenda."",
  ""Most moved significantly forward with the existing strategic project and have already transferred 5 out of the 11 strategic projects into a ramp-up or operations by now."",
  ""We managed to generate an operating EBT of €413 million."",
  ""Based on this year's earnings and taking the strategic and the investment plan into consideration, the supervisory board and the executive board will propose a dividend of €1.50 per share to our shareholders at the AGM in April 2025."",
  ""This is Looking at the next slide, safety and security."",
  ""Following the exceptional events of 2023, plant security and occupational safety continue to be the executive board's top priorities."",
  ""Let's take a look at plant security."",
  ""We completed a We have invested a middle double digit million amount in heightening security since September 2023."",
  ""Key objectives of these measures to raise plant security and better safeguard precious metals."",
  ""The comprehensive employee protection program was launched internally."",
  ""It includes risk analysis of critical roles, meaning those who could potentially be approached by criminal networks."",
  ""For work safety, we rolled out a program to transform occupational health and safety with three action areas."",
  ""Number one, management culture, introduce and establish safe conduct and practices."",
  ""Number two, risk management and safe side processes."",
  ""And number three, safety management."",
  ""Effective tools for safety management."",
  ""Our goal is to create a definite safety culture with effective safety management."",
  ""Looking on the next slide on the criminal activities directed against Aurubis."",
  ""In 2022/2023, You see that on the next slide."",
  ""The operating performance of the primary and secondary acids in the group was rather stable, which had slightly less throughput of primary and secondary input materials."",
  ""We did, however, face a longer than anticipated ramp-up phase at the Hamburg site."",
  ""After the major shutdown with strategic investment in the anode furnaces."",
  ""Despite lower volumes of secondary input material, Aurubis again processed well above 1 million tons of Recycling Materials."",
  ""Cathode output was in line with a slightly reduced throughput of input material, also slightly below previous year's figures."",
  ""The tankhouses in the group showed stable performance overall."",
  ""Cathode output was in line with the slightly reduced throughput of input materials, also slightly below previous year's figures."",
  ""The tankhouses in the group showed stable performance overall."",
  ""Sulfuric acid production was again in line with concentrate throughput, so also slightly below the previous year figures."",
  ""All in all, the acid reliability on a group level was satisfactory."",
  ""Let's look at the next slide of the market developments throughout the fiscal year."",
  ""You can see that market dynamics showed some shifts over the course of the year."",
  ""The copper and metal prices showed some volatility, while precious metals like gold and silver, a safe haven for investor shows positive momentum."",
  ""During the reporting period, the copper price ranged between $7,800 and $10,008 – $10,800 a ton, reflecting the macroeconomic developments."",
  ""Let's have a look at the various markets."",
  ""Aurubis experienced a good supply situation in quantity and quality of concentrate with increased TC/RCs during the reporting period, despite the significant drop of the spot market."",
  ""This, again, reflect Aurubis diversified supplier base with long-term contracts and the flexibility to adjust to market conditions."",
  ""As of today, Aurubis anticipates reduced pricing on the concentrate market, hence, reduced TC/RCs."",
  ""Aurubis concentrate supply situation is covered well into Q2 Looking at the Recycling Market."",
  ""Over the course of the fiscal year 2023/2024, we have seen sufficient availability of scrap materials."",
  ""The global sourcing markets with good refining charges during the reporting period."",
  ""CRU estimates an average RC of €340 per ton over fiscal year 2023/2024 for copper scrap number two without logistics."",
  ""This compares to €365 in the previous year, indicating a slight reduction."",
  ""RCs for complex recycling material showed a similar reduction in terms during the reporting period."",
  ""Looking forward, our production sites already supplied with material well into the second quarter of fiscal year 2024/2025."",
  ""The sulfuric acid market shows slow and steady improvement throughout the 2023/2024 fiscal year."",
  ""The return of some fertilizer manufacturers and stable demand from the European chemical industry met subdued European sulfuric acid production with increased price levels during the reporting ACP."",
  ""We expect ongoing strong demand for copper in Europe."",
  ""Therefore, the level of the Aurubis copper premium is expected on a stable level in 2025."",
  ""Aurubis has a long US dollar position of around approximately $560 million in the current fiscal year 2024/2025."",
  ""Within the scope of our hedging strategy, we hedge 60% of the US dollar exposure at $1.093 for the fiscal year 2024/2025 and around 30% at a rate of $1.094 for the fiscal year 2025/2026."",
  ""And now, I hand over to Steffen Hoffmann for further details."",
  ""We move on to our strategy and this slide that you here see now is not new for you."",
  ""The Aurubis strategic path will continue as announced to the capital market."",
  ""We are committed to deliver on the announced project and will continue to invest in our smelter network and especially into the recycling business."",
  ""Let's have a closer look at some of the milestones achieved with the strategic investments and the further outlook of our investment plan."",
  ""As said before, or 5 out of the 11 strategic projects have now been executed."",
  ""During the reporting period, we succeeded in delivering on the approved project."",
  ""The projects teams at all our sites work to fulfill what they have promised and handed the new facilities over for ramp-up of operations."",
  ""Subsequently, we are now in the ramp-up phases for the ASPA and BOB projects, while the new Anode Furnace, Industrial Heat Phase II and the Solar Park expansion in Pirdop are operating, and will start contributing to the bottom line."",
  ""And as a side note, the ceremonial inauguration of the BOB project will take place in Olen next Tuesday."",
  ""Let's take a look at the precise timeline of the projects still in implementation and the corresponding start of operations over the coming years."",
  ""Executing the approved strategic project is one of the key priorities for the executive board and for Aurubis."",
  ""As was mentioned, the first projects were implemented during the year."",
  ""After a ribbon cutting ceremony of Aurubis Richmond in September, we will ramp up the first module of the two step by step, now, during the running fiscal year 2024/2025."",
  ""The timeline for the start of operations of the strategic project are clearly laid out for the coming fiscal year, and such for when the first revenue will be generated."",
  ""Let's analyze how project progress corresponds with our CapEx spending."",
  ""You see that on the next slide."",
  ""In the reporting period, as mentioned, we saw the peak of CapEx spending for the current strategic roadmap."",
  ""We spent €855 million in total with a majority spent on realizing our growth projects."",
  ""Looking forward to the start of fiscal year 2024/2025, we will have another year of high spending before the group CapEx levels will normalize again."",
  ""We will continue to invest in our baseline to improve efficiencies and strive for higher production asset reliability."",
  ""Let's move forward to have a look at the additional earnings contribution from the strategic spendings and corresponding the change in free cash flow at midterm."",
  ""The business cases for our strategic investments remain promising."",
  ""We expect the additional EBITDA contribution from the wrapping up of the strategic projects of up to €260 million over the next three to four years."",
  ""Projects that have already been implemented like ASPA, the Solar Park expansion and BOB will contribute slightly positively to the EBITDA in the current fiscal year."",
  ""But will be outweighed by the anticipated ramp-up cost of around €50 million for the strategic projects."",
  ""The strong cash generation of the existing Aurubis business continues."",
  ""Our ambition is to significantly strengthen the free cash flow profile in the midterm."",
  ""Moving on to our efforts in sustainability."",
  ""Over the past years, Aurubis has made further progress in reducing CO2 emissions for its copper cathodes."",
  ""When it comes to sustainability, the environmental footprint of our production processes remains in a leading position compared to the global average."",
  ""Our absolute emissions for Scope 1 and 2 have also been further reduced by Finally, I would like to summarize what is important for the new executive board team of Aurubis."",
  ""We are committed to deliver."",
  ""We aim to improve the occupational safety and site security as our highest priority."",
  ""They serve as the basis for good working environment and our attractiveness as employer and safeguard our inventories."",
  ""We have delivered on the first project and are putting the investment plans into action."",
  ""For an improved earnings situation and a more positive free cash flow profile again, for the company's proven business model with balanced income components."",
  ""We will also continue to ensure that investors participate in the company's earnings profile."",
  ""Last but not the least, we continue to focus on reducing our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO2 emissions, following up on the first successful step towards this reduction."",
  ""With these final words, I would like now to hand back over to Elke Brinkmann."",
  ""I am here with our CEO, Toralf Haag; and our CFO, Steffen Hoffmann, who will present the figures for fiscal year 2023/2024 and current development at Aurubis."",
  ""After the presentation, the floor will be open for questions."",
  ""If you would like to ask a question during the Q&A session, please use the nine star key sequence."",
  ""Before we start, a brief reminder about the disclaimer on forward-looking statements."",
  ""Today's capital market presentation contains forward-looking statements about Aurubis' plans and expectations."",
  ""These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated."",
  ""Let me now turn the floor over to Toralf Haag."",
  ""And also from my side, a very warm welcome."",
  ""Moving from the market to the financial figures for financial year 2023/2024."",
  ""Revenues came in stable compared to the previous year, driven by higher copper and precious metal prices in the second half of the year, but offset by lower sales of shapes."",
  ""Gross profit stood at €1.7 billion and was significantly above last year's figures, which were impacted by the well-known one-offs."",
  ""This resulted in a robust operating EBT of €413 million, which is a 19% increase over the previous year's figures."",
  ""Main drivers were slightly increased TC/RCs for concentrates, a significantly higher metal result, higher earnings from the Aurubis copper premium coupled with ongoing high demand for wire rod, lower energy costs and income from the sale of the Buffalo site."",
  ""These effects were counteracted by significantly decreased sulfuric acid revenues, considerably lower income from refining charges, and higher costs, e.g. ramp-up costs for strategic projects."",
  ""Based on the rolling four quarters of the EBIT, this results in a ROCE of 11.4% – 11.5%, representing a slight enhancement despite much higher capital employed due to the strategic investments undertaking – undertaken in the fiscal year."",
  ""On the next chart, come to the gross margin."",
  ""We achieved a gross margin of more than €2.1 billion in total and the generation was again well-balanced across our income components, which is yet another sign of the resilience of Aurubis business model with its various earnings drivers."",
  ""On the metal result, stable production, acid performance, higher metal prices for copper, gold and silver in particular and the financial impact of the last year's one-off effect led to a significant increase in the metal results year-over-year."",
  ""On TCs and RCs, additionally, ongoing good market conditions for concentrate and slightly subdued terms for Recycling Materials led to a reduction of gross margin earnings year-over-year."",
  ""Finally, on Premiums and Products, last but not the least."",
  ""In absolute terms, gross margin earnings from Premiums and Products came in slightly above prior year levels, while they came in slightly below prior year figures in relative terms."",
  ""This is due to the significant increase of the metal result compared to the previous year."",
  ""Short deep dive on CSPs in the Custom Smelting & Products segment, operating EBT reached €446 million, which is a significant improvement."",
  ""This uplift compared to the previous year is in large part due to the last year's one-off effects that were allocated to the CSP segment."",
  ""As already mentioned, concentrate throughput was subdued as a consequence of the plant maintenance shutdown in Hamburg and the acid subsequent slower than anticipated ramp-up phase."",
  ""Adding these parts together, the return on capital employed reached a comparatively very good 19.6% and hence exceeded the previous year's 13%."",
  ""In the Multimetal Recycling segment, MMR, operating EBT came in at €79 million, and as such, substantially below the previous year figures."",
  ""Overall, operating performance in the segment was stable with slightly lower availabilities of input materials, which led to reduced throughput in the segment."",
  ""While tankhouses in the segment showed good operating performance."",
  ""The modernized tankhouse in Lünen is now operating at increased capacity, supporting the increase in cathode production versus the previous year levels."",
  ""Along with market factors, the result for this segment was influenced by the ramp-up costs for Richmond."",
  ""And as a result of the lower EBIT and the increased capital employed due to investments in the segment and to Richmond in particular, the segment's ROCE came in at 5.6%, which is below prior year figures."",
  ""On the cost piece, total group costs increased by 4.6% versus last year, with some movement between the expense positions."",
  ""On the positive side, at a group level, energy cost declined further, and a reduction in cost for consumables and external services was achieved."",
  ""These beneficial effects were negatively outweighed by higher personnel costs, which reflect general wage inflation and staff expansion related to our growth projects, as well as one-off effects for the compensation payments for the former executive board members."",
  ""Additionally, Aurubis had higher expenses for legal advisory as well as consultancy fees in connection with the criminal activities during the financial year 2023/2024."",
  ""Moving on to the walk from EBITDA to net cash flow."",
  ""In financial year 2023/2024, Aurubis generated an operating EBITDA of €622 million where working capital showed favorable development of plus €49 million."",
  ""This was counteracted by minus €17 million in Texas and minus €64 million for other positions."",
  ""These consist mainly of valuation effects of non-cash related positions."",
  ""In total, net cash flow amounted to a healthy €537 million and well in the guided range."",
  ""I think it's fair to say that Aurubis is very robust and capable of converting profits into cash flow from operating activities."",
  ""Let's now have a look at the cash flow bridge."",
  ""I mentioned the net cash flow of €537 million, which is well within the guidance we gave between €500 million and €600 million."",
  ""We used €726 million to pursue our growth strategy."",
  ""Here capital expenditure for Richmond represented the biggest single item, which will lead to higher EBITDA contributions in the medium term."",
  ""With moderate interest payments and the dividend payment for the last fiscal year, free cash flow amounted to minus €280 million."",
  ""At the end of financial year 2023/2024, Aurubis had a solid cash position of €322 million."",
  ""The key performance indicators show a healthy and robust picture."",
  ""Our equity ratio was at 55.9% and remains well above the target level."",
  ""Debt coverage will gradually pick up as the strategic investments are progressing and are partially financed by ongoing operating cash flows."",
  ""Even with this pickup, Aurubis was still very much in line with the guided range of below 1.0 during the investment period and well below the longer-term target."",
  ""CapEx was as planned on a high level at €855 million, more than 50% of the €1.7 billion envelope that is related to the strategic project is behind us."",
  ""The substantial increase in capital employed is a consequence of ongoing strategic investments and increases in our asset base."",
  ""Despite continued high investments for strategic projects, the executive board and supervisory board are proposing a slightly higher dividend to shareholders due to the good financial results achieved in the reporting period and the company's financial strength."",
  ""It is important to us that we ensure that our shareholders participate in the company's success."",
  ""We, therefore, suggest the dividend of €1.5 per share, which represents a dividend payout ratio of 20% of the group's operating EPS."",
  ""This would correspond to a yield of 2.3% based on the share price of €65.85 on September 30."",
  ""Let's move on to the next chart."",
  ""Let's move on to the outlook for the markets for financial year 2024/2025."",
  ""On concentrates, as already widely discussed with the capital markets, the concentrate market is expected to be tighter as the result of expansion in the smelter industry."",
  ""Despite the tight markets from a contractual perspective, we are already 90% supplied with concentrates for the new fiscal year and are only partially dependent on the benchmark."",
  ""As of today, there's not yet a benchmark as a reference known in the market."",
  ""On scrap and recycling materials, for the copper scrap market, we anticipate stable supply with RCs at stable levels."",
  ""The copper scrap market remains the short-term market defined by short-term developments and factors like collection rates, metal prices and Chinese imports."",
  ""The availability of complex recycling materials like shredder, PCBs, residues, slags and ashes is also expected to stay at stable levels."",
  ""We foresee equally stable RCs for those materials as the market is less volatile due to framework contracts."",
  ""Our production plants are supplied with recycling materials well into Q2 2024/2025."",
  ""On sulfuric assets, based on stable demand from the European chemical and fertilizer industry, we expect a slightly favorable price trend at the beginning of financial year 2024/2025."",
  ""Looking forward, there could be some potential for price changes once pre-capacity volumes from the Asian region are available for export markets."",
  ""On the Aurubis copper premium, the ACP is based on the expectation of ongoing strong demand for copper in Europe."",
  ""Therefore, the level of the Aurubis copper premium is expected on a stable level in 2025."",
  ""Coming to our products, rod, shapes and flat rolled business, we continue to foresee high demand for wire rod driven by the infrastructure sector though demand from the automotive business will remain low."",
  ""We expect shapes to be stable."",
  ""The flat rolled product sales are expected on lower levels due to the sale of Aurubis Buffalo."",
  ""Overall, we have already secured substantial volumes with good prices for calendar year 2025."",
  ""In line with our announcement on September 2024 and based on our last assumption for both earnings drivers and cost components, Aurubis is providing a forecast for the group result and continues to expect an operating EBT of between €300 million and €400 million and an operating ROCE of between 7% and 11%."",
  ""For the Multimetal Recycling segment, we expect an operating EBT of between €50 million and €110 million and an operating ROCE of between 4% and 8%."",
  ""The anticipated ROCE is subdued due in large part to the growth investments in Richmond."",
  ""For the Custom Smelting & Products segment, we expect operating EBT of between €310 million and €370 million and an operating ROCE of between 14% and 18%."",
  ""In these figures, the maintenance shutdown in Pirdop in May, June 2025 with a negative EBT effect of €34 million is already included."",
  ""And with this, I'd like to hand over to Toralf again."",
  ""Before we start the Q&A session, I would like to provide you with an outlook for the next event."",
  ""Our Q1 report will be published on February 6, followed by the AGM on April 3."",
  ""With this outlook, we would like to  for your attention and I would like to ask the operator to take your questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I will start on your project again."",
  ""My first question is basically just on the growth projects, which you've been removing from your CapEx agenda for 2026 and 2027."",
  ""We saw at least the CapEx load for the growth part has been coming down?"",
  ""And then maybe also related to that, what have been driving the increase by the base of the baseline CapEx by €50 million?"",
  ""Those are my first question."",
  ""So, there is not one big item which you removed away, even though the overall absolute amount of growth CapEx has come down a lot?"",
  ""And then just to stay on the CapEx side."",
  ""I mean, of course, there have been quite a few escalations in budgets over time."",
  ""I guess, you're not coming in with two of pairs of fresh eyes."",
  ""So, have you had the chance to conclude your, I think, second guess of the budgeting for both CapEx and maybe also the operational profile and targets of these projects?"",
  ""Would you still subscribe to those Okay, understood."",
  ""Then my last question is on the start-up losses and also the phasing of the contribution."",
  ""So, with regard to the, I guess, €50 million start-up losses, which you've been highlighting and you've been including in your guidance."",
  ""How should we be thinking about the phasing of this?"",
  ""Would this be very upfront loaded in 2025?"",
  ""And then we can already expect like a net contribution in the last quarter or should we be – those should we expect those start-up losses to drag on and potentially also continue to see some even in the course of the next financial year?"",
  ""And then, and I know it's early, obviously, to think about the next fiscal year, since you've guided for the upcoming one."",
  ""But is there still going to be more start-up losses which are going to drag into the following fiscal year or do you already expect a net contribution from your growth again?"",
  ""And I'll move back into the queue."",
  ""First, I have a question concerning the Buffalo intake."",
  ""If I got it right from your report, your EBT contribution was 32% and the cash flow contribution, €97 million."",
  ""So, does that mean that the entire free cash flow for the year was minus €400 million approximately?"",
  ""Is that the right assumption?"",
  ""And then, when it comes to legal and consulting, because these were more or less one-off costs for the system fraud issues."",
  ""Can you give us a number how much that was in the last fiscal year?"",
  ""So, going back to the cash flow and free cash flow."",
  ""When we start it is minus €400 million into the New Year, is there something that you put some kind of a buffer because of the uncertainty when it comes to TC/RCs and so on and so forth, that we can expect some more of a free cash flow generation from working capital in the year to come?"",
  ""And then a question concerning battery recycling."",
  ""Of course, you are currently in an ongoing testing phase, let's put it that way."",
  ""But the framework for EVs, especially in Europe, is a little bit lackluster."",
  ""And, of course, we see Are you in closer talks with any kind of possible joint venture partners or other partners?"",
  ""All the best for your stock."",
  ""So, coming back on Bastian's question on the contribution from new projects this fiscal year."",
  ""Previous management had guided for €100 million approximately of contribution."",
  ""But it seems in your comments that you only targeted minimal contribution."",
  ""And on top of that, there would be €50 million of ramp-up costs."",
  ""So, how do we reconcile the two statements and what's driving this big decrease there?"",
  ""And just a last follow-up on this one."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""I was just wondering whether you could maybe discuss there some areas you see for the TC/RC benchmark."",
  ""When do you expect the TC/RC benchmark to be set actually?"",
  ""And maybe you could discuss the case whether there would be a possibility that there's no benchmark set."",
  ""And because in the past years we typically see the benchmark set I think end of November or maybe October even."",
  ""And then also, if you could maybe quantify the one-offs?"",
  ""I know you've shed some light on the consultancy fees, but also maybe for outgoing management Yeah."",
  ""I just wanted to double check on the whole sort of TC/RC flow through thing."",
  ""So you've given guidance for next year."",
  ""Are you able to share with us the assumed TC/RCs that feed into that guidance?"",
  ""Just to follow up, if I could."",
  ""The – you've said that you're covered for concentrates for the first half of the year."",
  ""How do you think about giving guidance for the full year when you still haven't contracted your concentrate for the second half of the year?"",
  ""Okay, Steffen,  for the color."",
  ""Look, just something breaking on the wires right now."",
  ""So, we've just had an announcement on benchmark copper processing fees."",
  ""And so, this is apparently between Antofagasta and Jiangxi copper."",
  ""And they've signed at Okay."",
  ""I appreciate the color guys."",
  ""Yeah,  for taking my follow-up."",
  ""I just wanted to come back on your CapEx profile and also the earnings contribution part of your growth."",
  ""So, just having done the math, I think you've been removing about €400 million of growth CapEx from, I think, you're, I think planning for the next four years."",
  ""But then you still say that you aim to hit the €260 million earnings contribution over the next three to four years, which obviously I do struggle to reconcile."",
  ""So, could you just help us to solve that equation, i.e. like how can you still hit the €260 million if you're spending €400 million less on growth versus what you were indicating before?"",
  ""So, basically part of what you optimize, maybe where – maybe it were the sort of non like profit-yielding projects."",
  ""And then, I guess, you probably also had a bit of a profit buffer in your assumptions, I suppose?"",
  ""Well, as a new management board, of course, we looked at the CapEx plan for the next years for the midterm plan."",
  ""We did a more focused approach with the major CapEx projects."",
  ""And for the baseline investment business, we took I think a more conservative approach in order also to secure the reliable execution of our improvement."",
  ""So, in all in all, there have been no major changes."",
  ""We didn't take out one single big item."",
  ""It's more of a fine-tuning exercise."",
  ""Well, Steffen and I, we did, of course, which was one of the first tasks we did."",
  ""We did due diligence on the CapEx project first of all on the budget and the timeline, but also on the contribution."",
  ""And, of course, there have been some changes here and there, but no major changes."",
  ""And we are both convinced that the major strategic projects are very important for the further development of the Aurubis company and that the returns will come with the magnitude as previously proposed."",
  ""Well, as you know, we have invested quite a bit over the last years, this year to further develop our technology."",
  ""We've also invested in a pilot plant."",
  ""Right now, we continue to invest in this field, I would say, on a low level in order to stay ahead of the game in the technological development."",
  ""But we are watching the market developments carefully before we would do a further large investment in new operation."",
  ""So, we stay ahead of the game technological wise, with capacity expansions, we are currently careful because of the new quoted market developments."",
  ""We have talked with quite a few potential partners for technological leadership."",
  ""But as you might understand, we cannot or don't want to disclose these partners right now."",
  ""Well, I mean, I just want to repeat what we said."",
  ""We see ramp-up costs for strategic projects of €50 million."",
  ""I think the IR team also communicated that before at least I arrived on October 1."",
  ""So, that was, I think, a language that the team was using in September."",
  ""And we confirmed the midterm additional EBITDA impact of €260 million positive within the next three to four years."",
  ""We also said today that in the midterm, we don't want to be more specific than that."",
  ""Perhaps you're referring to statements that had been made at the early stage."",
  ""Probably not this year, neither by this management nor by the statement on this year."",
  ""But I understand your question, but please appreciate we would not want to go further than that."",
  ""But we are very sure and very definite that there's super good strategic projects s in place that will give the positive impact, as we've just outlined it."",
  ""On the TC/RCs, what we currently hear and see is that it could take some more weeks until a benchmark is set here."",
  ""So, we don't expect the short term."",
  ""And on the overall market development, we see some slight improvement of the TC/RCs from the lowest level."",
  ""But we don't expect significant improvements during this fiscal year due to the competitive situation, mainly from China."",
  ""We cannot give you an exact figure, but since we have a good mix in our coverage of also long-term contracts with our suppliers."",
  ""Our average TC/RCs are higher than the current spot rates, of course."",
  ""But we cannot give you the exact figure for competitive reasons."",
  ""So, on the ramp-up costs for the strategic projects, including a €50 million for the current, for the new fiscal year 2024/2025."",
  ""And I think we are all aware that more than the lion's share of that is related to Richmond."",
  ""This is basically relatively evenly now shared during – over the quarters."",
  ""Just as another data point, Q4 last fiscal year was around €15 million."",
  ""And now, here we talk about 50 divided by 4."",
  ""So, let's say, as I said, it's evenly distributed over the four quarters of this fiscal year."",
  ""I mean, we are happy to discuss the new fiscal year with you at this moment."",
  ""Would not yet be prepared to go in further details on the fiscal year 2025/2026."",
  ""We can commit as far as €260 million in the next three to four years as an EBITDA contribution from all of the strategic projects."",
  ""We can also confirm the message on €170 million EBITDA effect after the ramp-up of Richmond and that we at this stage would not want to be more precise on the exact phasing of the ramp-up."",
  ""So, on Buffalo, first of all, we are very happy with the Buffalo deal."",
  ""We found the best owner for Buffalo with Wieland."",
  ""We agreed contractually on the non-disclosure policy."",
  ""But you did your job and you found a few figures in the Annual Report."",
  ""So, we are here a bit in the limbo between Annual Report item that we have to disclose, but also contractual obligation."",
  ""So, I think you did your math well."",
  ""That was around €15 million."",
  ""So, 1-5, €15 million for the various consultancy pieces related to the fraud incidents."",
  ""I mean, generally, the pieces that we are giving to the market is that we want to achieve a operating free cash flow before investments of around €500 million to €600 million."",
  ""And as the Hamburg And if I might add, you were adding in your question this word closer."",
  ""So, Toralf confirmed general talks."",
  ""But we think we are not in close talks."",
  "" for that question, Maxime."",
  ""I mean, obviously, when you give a guidance, there's a reason why you give a range of So, we think this should have a positive impact on the Q1 results."",
  ""So, we are quite happy looking into the first weeks of this year."",
  ""And we also should be because if you look at the kind of the quarterly profile from an EBT perspective, we would assume that Q1, Q2, relatively speaking, in terms of looking at all the four quarters, Q1 and Q2 should be a bit stronger."",
  ""Because, obviously, Q3 will be impacted by Pirdop, by the shutdown, where we gave the indication that the shutdown impact would be around €34 million EBT."",
  ""So, Q1, Q2, stronger, Q3 impacted by Pirdop shutdown and then Q4 on a more normal level than Q3."",
  ""And as I said, Q1 so far, we are happy with what we have seen."",
  ""Well, as we said in the speech, beginning of this call, on energy cost, we would expect them being slightly up versus last year, which would be basically driven by CO2 and coal prices."",
  ""That's the rough indication we can give at this stage."",
  ""Cornelis, there was a second part in your question and I think Yeah."",
  ""So, basically, it's the two one-offs or the two items."",
  ""I would label one-off €15 million consultancy fees for the fraudulent cases and €9.5 million for compensation benefits for the former executive board."",
  ""I mean, we gave two statements, right?"",
  ""The one was that from a supply perspective, we are covered until Q2."",
  ""And we also said that from a contractual perspective, we are covered by 90%."",
  ""And we also usually make the point and you heard us saying that quite often, that obviously not all our contracts that – that we have are linked to the benchmark."",
  ""Many of the contracts are linked to the benchmark, but not all of them."",
  ""And those that are linked to the benchmark do not necessarily have only a one-to-one direct link to the benchmark."",
  ""So, there's quite some kind of translation effort one would need to do."",
  ""As Toralf said, we cannot give you a figure of what our assumption is."",
  ""But qualitatively, we did say that the concentrate market is expected to be tighter."",
  ""And I think you could translate that, that we think that TC/RCs are more under pressure than last year."",
  ""That would be qualitatively baked into the guidance."",
  ""Needless to say, that – you know, that we love also to discuss with you that besides TC/RCs, there's also quite some other interesting pieces on the Aurubis robust business model that can counteract it with the pressure on TC/RCs."",
  ""That goes in line with the mix we have of long-term contracts and spot market into our guidance."",
  ""So, it fits into our guidance."",
  ""I think I don't know whether you took into account that perhaps there's more behind us that you initially have thought."",
  ""So, as Toralf has said, we have not eliminated any of the important project."",
  ""So, that's why we are confirming the €260 million."",
  ""So, kind of online, I cannot exactly – This is correct."",
  ""The IR team will, of course, be happy to answer any further questions you may have."",
  ""We would now like to close today's conference call, and  for your attention."",
  ""We wish you a pleasant rest of the day and a wonderful pre-Christmas period.""

58,3140810,05RL67-E,2024-12-03,"[
  "" for joining us in the room and on our live webcast this morning."",
  ""I'm the Group CEO of SSP."",
  ""And I'm joined by Jonathan Davies, our Deputy CEO and CFO."",
  ""Before we take you through the detail of our full year performance for FY 2024, I wanted to start with some reflections on where the business sits today."",
  ""I've been CEO of SSP for two-and-a-half years now."",
  ""What's clear to me is both that SSP is a strong business and that we have more to do to reflect that strength in our profitability and returns."",
  ""While the pace of transition from COVID recovery to a business with demonstrably strong returns has been fast, it hasn't been fast enough."",
  ""And there are two key reasons for this."",
  ""First, as we emerged from COVID, we chose to take advantage of the immediate competitive opportunities we had to build a bigger and a better platform for long-term growth and returns."",
  ""By this I mean renewing, winning and opening new contracts, and also making four important infill acquisitions."",
  ""Out of that, we've strengthened our market leading positions in the most attractive and high growth food travel markets in the world and we have lengthened the remaining contract tenure in our estate from four years to six years."",
  ""At the same time, we've improved our customer propositions and we've strengthened our client and customer relationships."",
  ""While the early performance of these investments is encouraging, we have more to do to build out the returns that we require on these investments."",
  ""Second, the profitability in parts of our Continental European region has fallen short of our expectations, while we've done a nice job in retaining and extending almost 40% of our European contract base in the last two years, in addition to mobilizing new business."",
  ""But the operating disruption caused by this activity, together with a number of additional headwinds during the year – some macroeconomic, some structural, some temporary and some executional – have negatively impacted profitability in the region."",
  ""Importantly, though, both of these reasons are short-term and both of these reasons are fixable."",
  ""In a moment, I will take you through the specific actions we have in place to improve profitability in Continental Europe and to deliver faster returns on the total level of investments we've made across the whole group."",
  ""Our confidence in delivering these actions is demonstrated in clear earnings per share guidance for FY 2025 and granular performance expectations for our medium-term financial framework."",
  ""Consistent with these plans, we are proposing today changes to our incentive schemes to better align management targets with shareholder returns."",
  ""All of this I'll talk about in more detail."",
  ""But before I hand over to Jonathan to take you through the FY 2024 financials, I wanted to touch on three things."",
  ""First, our focus on FY 2024 operating performance, particularly in half two, has flowed through to cash."",
  ""We've ended the year with net debt at £593 million and leverage levels at 1.7 times, a little better than our initial expectations."",
  ""Two, three of our four regions, North America, Asia and the Middle East and the UK, delivered strong growth and strong operating profit progression, particularly in the second half."",
  ""And the third area for me to highlight today is our clear agenda for FY 2025, which you can see on the right-hand side of this slide."",
  ""This is where our whole team's focus is and we've got a clear set of actions to deliver on this agenda."",
  ""I'll come back in a few minutes to this and our focus in FY 2025 in more detail."",
  ""But for now, I'm going to hand over to Jonathan to take you through the FY 2024 results."",
  ""So, we've had a good second half, led by strong sales growth and a recovery in operating margin, and this left full year sales at £3.4 billion, up 17% year-on-year on a constant currency basis."",
  ""Underlying operating profit was up by 32% to £206 million, and EPS was as expected at £0.10, up 41% year-on-year, including, as we indicated in October, some one-off benefits in tax and interest."",
  ""Net debt was down to £593 million at the end of September."",
  ""So, better than our expectations in October."",
  ""And that left leverage at 1.7 times compared with 2.1 times at the end of the first half."",
  ""So, back within our target range."",
  ""And we're proposing to pay a full year dividend of £0.035 per share, representing a payout ratio of 35%."",
  ""So, briefly looking at the results under IFRS 16."",
  ""Operating profit was £247 million for the year, £40 million higher than the pre-IFRS 16 result."",
  ""The main difference here, as ever, is that under IFRS accounting, it's the treatment of our leases where the minimum guaranteed rents are capitalized, and therefore no longer included in the rent line."",
  ""The effect is to increase EBITDA by £277 million, but correspondingly increase depreciation by £236 million."",
  ""And the reported operating profit also includes an exceptional charge of £41 million, principally comprising impairment charges of £33 million."",
  ""Now, turning to our underlying performance."",
  ""Our overall results were in line with expectations."",
  ""And if we compare to the planning assumptions that we set out this time last year and which we gave on a constant currency basis, sales were at the top end of the range at £3.5 billion, EBITDA was bang in the middle of the range at £359 million, and operating profit at £218 million was just below the midpoint of that range."",
  ""Now, turning to sales and current trading."",
  ""Like-for-like sales have remained robust and very steady at around 6% during the second half, and over the first eight weeks of the new financial year, they've remained at a very similar level with like-for-likes running at 5%."",
  ""And we continue to see good sales growth across all our regions."",
  ""So, firstly, looking at the like-for-likes."",
  ""Asia and Middle East was the standout performer in the year with like-for-like at 17%."",
  ""And it was still in the mid-teens during the second half."",
  ""The region benefited from strong passenger growth in a number of markets, including India, Egypt, Thailand and Australia."",
  ""The like-for-like performance in the UK was very encouraging at 11% for the full year and was still running at 9% in the second half."",
  ""This was driven by good passenger growth in the air sector, particularly over the summer, and a steady recovery in rail passengers helped by the more limited impact of strikes compared to the previous year."",
  ""In North America, like-for-like was 6% for the year, 5% in the second half."",
  ""This was a good performance given that it was against pretty tough comparatives."",
  ""However, worth noting that passenger numbers were a little softer in the second half in the US, where a number of the major airlines have been operating reduced schedules, largely due to the well-publicized Boeing issues."",
  ""Like-for-like sales in Continental Europe was 6%, and that was despite the impacts on our rail business of the strikes and the weaker trading over the Paris Olympics, as well as the soft trading in our German motorway service business."",
  ""Looking at the net gains of 4%, these reflected the further mobilization of the contract pipeline that we've talked about in the past, notably in North America where this contributed a further 8% to sales growth."",
  ""We also saw a decent contribution from acquisitions in the year of 4%, principally again from North America at 12%, and this reflected the Midfield Concessions deal from the previous summer as well as the two smaller acquisitions in the first half at Atlanta and in Canada."",
  ""And we also saw a 9% contribution to sales in Asia and the Middle East, which came from the ARE acquisition in Australia in May."",
  ""Finally, over the first eight weeks of the new financial year, overall sales growth has remained strong at 13%, and that includes the 5% I just referred to earlier in terms of like-for-like sales."",
  ""Operating profit increased by 32% year-on-year with group operating margin up 70 basis points."",
  ""Looking at the regions, we saw a very strong result in North America with operating profit up 52% and with a 170 basis point improvement in operating margin, which is well ahead of the pre-COVID level."",
  ""In Asia and the Middle East profit also grew strongly, up 32%, driven by the strong sales growth I've just covered, as well as of course the contribution from the ARE acquisition in the second half."",
  ""In the UK we delivered profit growth of 26% year-on-year and a margin enhancement of 70 basis points."",
  ""Now this reflected a very much better second half, having seen margin actually down a little in the first half."",
  ""But of course that was largely due to the scale of the renewal program in the first half."",
  ""However, against this backdrop, the performance of continental Europe was disappointing with operating profit down 46% and the margin halving to 1.6%."",
  ""Now the macroeconomic backdrop for all of our continental European operations was difficult with weaker consumer spending, particularly in Northern Europe and passenger numbers in the rail sector still well below pre-COVID levels."",
  ""And all of this was exacerbated by a number of significant but largely temporary trading challenges."",
  ""So, let me just go through those."",
  ""Firstly, we saw the intermittent strike action in France and Germany and the impact of the lower volumes during the Paris Olympics, which hit our rail operations and drove up our labor costs."",
  ""Secondly, the sheer scale of the renewal program, particularly in the Nordic countries put short-term pressure on the P&L due to the disruption and pre-opening costs So in the round, we were able to mitigate many of these temporary headwinds through client compensation and in some cases the use of government support."",
  ""But that doesn't take away from the fact that these results were frankly, below our expectation."",
  ""Patrick will cover our profit improvement plans for continental Europe in more detail later, as he said."",
  ""Now let me turn to the overall group P&L. As I've already said, operating margin was up 70 basis points on a constant currency basis."",
  ""So, if we look down the key lines, gross margin improved by 60 basis points."",
  ""This was another strong performance, albeit helped by the easing of some of the inflationary pressures we've been seeing in many food commodities."",
  ""However, once again I feel this demonstrates our ability to mitigate inflation through pricing action as well as the effectiveness of our programs to work on menu and range engineering."",
  ""Labor issues were 60 basis points better than last year and that's despite the inflationary pressures on pay rates."",
  ""However again, here we were helped by the strength of the like-for-like sales in many regions and the deployment of digital order and payment technology."",
  ""Finally concession fees you can see were 70 basis points higher year-on-year."",
  ""But this of course, included the impact of this particularly high level of contract renewals, most notably in the continental European region, as I've described earlier."",
  ""So, if we look further down the P&L net profit of around £80 million was driven by the strong second half performance where we delivered net income of £88 million following the small net loss of £8 million in the first half."",
  ""And this reflects the increasing second half weighting of the business."",
  ""This is due to the higher dependence on air and leisure travel."",
  ""And frankly, we expect the first half, second half split to be very similar, as we look into 2025."",
  ""Interest costs were broadly flat year-on-year, but in underlying terms they increased slightly due to the higher average level of net debt, this arising from the acquisitions as well as the high level of CapEX and higher interest rates."",
  ""However these upward pressures were offset by a one-time £6 million gain on money market deposits in India."",
  ""The tax charge of £35 million represents an ETR of 19.5%, which benefited from the recognition of a deferred tax asset in the US, which of course is a direct consequence of the increasing profitability of our business in the States."",
  ""And looking forward, we anticipate a return to a more normal ETR of around 22% to 23%."",
  ""The lower contribution that you can see here from our associates was largely due to start-up costs in our new joint venture with Aéroport de Paris Extime, which commenced operation in early 2024."",
  ""And just to remind you, this joint venture will ultimately run nearly all of the food and beverage across both of the main Paris airports, ultimately running over 100 outlets."",
  ""Now let me give you just a little bit more detail on the minority interest figure."",
  ""Given that we have a number of moving parts within the JV arrangement."",
  ""So first of all, North America, you can see the minority interest charge rose at a slightly lower level than the overall operating profit in the region, reflecting the relatively stronger year-on-year performance in our airports with lower joint venture shares and the good performance in Canada where we own the business 100%."",
  ""And this was very much in line with what we actually saw in the first half."",
  ""In Asia and the Middle East."",
  ""The minority interest charge was flat because the operating profit growth principally came from the wholly-owned businesses, including of course, a good contribution from the acquisition of ARE in Australia."",
  ""Now the Indian numbers do require a little bit of explanation."",
  ""Firstly, the minority interest increased due to the one-off money market gain that I've just covered."",
  ""Secondly, TFS, our joint venture has entered into a new joint venture with Adani Airport who own, amongst other airports, Mumbai, where they've been both our client and our joint venture partner for several years."",
  ""So this new joint venture established last June specifically for the Mumbai operations, has enabled us to secure a long-term extension of our very successful business in Mumbai, including our lounge business."",
  ""And looking forward and importantly it gives us access to the growing portfolio of airports in the Adani estate."",
  ""And in fact, we're already running food and beverage outlets in six further Adani owned airports as well as Mumbai."",
  ""Now, under this new structure, our shareholding in Mumbai has reduced from 44% to 25% and therefore will no longer be consolidated."",
  ""And the effect of this on our 2025 numbers will be to reduce reported So now finishing with the cash flow."",
  ""We've used £233 million of cash in the year which was after the investment of £280 million in capital projects and a further £139 million on acquisitions."",
  ""It's worth noting that SSP share of CapEx net of contributions from partners and control joint ventures and associates was £267 million and again we've included more detail on that in an appendix to these slides."",
  ""We saw a working capital outflow of £20 million in the year and that reflects the normal generation of cash with increasing sales and therefore increasing negative working capital."",
  ""But this was more than offset in the year by the unwind of the remaining deferred payments from the COVID period amounting to around £40 million."",
  ""Net financing costs were £36 billion in the period and this left net debt of £593 million and leverage at 1.7 times, as I described earlier."",
  ""Now looking forward, given the anticipated seasonality of our CapEx and working capital cycle over the year and therefore the planned usage of cash in the first half, we would expect leverage to be slightly higher than this by the half year before reversing again in the second half and returning towards the lower end of our target range by the end of 2025."",
  ""And with that, I'm going to pass over to Patrick to take you through the strategic highlights and the outlook."",
  ""At the start of this meeting, I talked about the work that we have done to strengthen and to expand our business with the objective of delivering great propositions for customers and clients and also sustainable returns for investors."",
  ""We compete in structurally growing food travel markets and we've prioritized building our presence and capability in the higher growth and higher returning geographic air channel markets."",
  ""While, of course, defending our existing market positions by renewing and extending as the travel world reopens post-COVID."",
  ""All of this work has created a strong platform, but the benefits of this now need to be better reflected in how we build earnings and cash flows from here."",
  ""In a moment, I'll take you through our plans to deliver this step-up in performance."",
  ""But before doing this, let me take a moment to explain the why, where and how we've invested over the course of the last two years."",
  ""About 60% of the £690 million invested has been into the base estate where we've extended our existing contract base."",
  ""The higher than usual level of contract renewals, described previously as catch-up is a reflection of the fact that many renewals were put on hold in the aftermath of COVID."",
  ""It also, though, includes necessary investments we've made in our store and customer propositions in certain markets, notably the UK."",
  ""And the final piece of this space investment has been in technology."",
  ""Cumulatively, this has meant that over the last two years, approximately a third of our total estates and almost 40% of our Continental European estate has been renewed and extended."",
  ""And in doing so, we've lengthened average remaining contract term from four years to six years."",
  ""The second 40% of our total investment has been allocated to growing the business."",
  ""Winning and mobilizing new contracts, deliberately weighted to North America, to India, to Asia and the Middle East."",
  ""Within this expansion investment, we spent approximately £180 million on acquisitions to build our position and market share in North America and Asia."",
  ""The integration of these businesses has proceeded in line with our expectations."",
  ""Each of these new contract and M&A investments has been put through our well-established investment review process, with projected returns expected to be in line with our historical returns profile."",
  ""As I said earlier, much of the £690 million of investment is yet to fully mature."",
  ""Driving the profitability of this and delivering the expected return on this is a priority for us this year."",
  ""In addition to growth investment, though, we have fundamentally strengthened our proposition, our customer offers and enhanced our client relationships."",
  ""And we've made strong progress in each of these areas in FY 2024."",
  ""In the year we've added more than 20 new clients and entered two new geographic markets, Saudi Arabia and New Zealand."",
  ""We've done this, while materially strengthening our propositions to and relationships with customers."",
  ""Indeed, our customer rating, as measured by our Reputation tool now, which is based on monthly feedback from approximately 15,000 different customers, has improved to 4.4 out of 5 from 4.2 out of 5 in FY 2023 and 3.8 out of 5 in FY 2022."",
  ""And we've also strengthened our sustainability credentials both in short-term delivery and in the longer term, about which we've added more detail in the appendix to this presentation and which we will highlight in our third Sustainability Report, which we are going to publish later this month."",
  ""I'll now turn to our four regional divisions and highlight how we are driving growth and returns in each case, starting with North America."",
  ""With a strengthening competitive position there and experienced and highly capable team and momentum on all fronts in the large and growing North American market, our strategy is to build our market share to more than 20% in the medium-term."",
  ""To date, we've done this organically through like-for-like and new unit growth opportunities complemented by thoughtful in-fill M&A. While we're pausing new M&A activity this year, our recent experience of the three acquisitions that we made is very positive with returns building in line with our plans."",
  ""We now have a presence in 53 of the top 200 airports in North America, up from 37 two years ago or at the end of FY 2022, reflecting a combination of this business development momentum and M&A. This has delivered top line growth in FY 2024 of 26% at constant currency rates, as well as building operating profit margin, which is at nearly 10% this year."",
  ""Key to this North American performance has been a concurrent focus on efficiency and productivity, while we grow from menu optimization to drive gross profit, to automated kitchen equipment to reduce staffing needs, to consistent use of technology to drive down costs and waste."",
  ""North America will continue to be a great growth driver for this group, delivering high revenue growth and sustainable margin growth and returns."",
  ""Similar to North America, but from a very different starting point, we are planning to more than double the size of SSP in Asia and the Middle East over the medium-term."",
  ""These regions have some of the fastest growing airports infrastructure and food travel markets in the world, and we're investing both to build further scale in our existing geographic footprint and to very selectively enter attractive new markets to secure long-term growth and returns."",
  ""India in particular, is a strategically important market for us."",
  ""Here we operate with our joint venture partner, TFS."",
  ""This year, as Jonathan has described, we've combined strong like-for-like growth with an expansion of our partnerships in India, notably with TFS' new joint venture with Adani airports."",
  ""This partnership not only extends the tenure of our highly profitable operations in Mumbai, but also gives us access to six new airports across India."",
  ""Through TFS though we are also building industry-leading lounge propositions and we're positioned to capture more regional lounge opportunities outside of India into markets such as Malaysia and Hong Kong, where we have already opened multiple new lounges this year."",
  ""As a group, we're consistent in focusing our expansion investments in markets where we see the greatest long-term growth and return dynamics."",
  ""This has meant an expansion of our business into Saudi Arabia this year, as well as a trebling of the size of our Australian business through our acquisition of ARE and the integration of that into our strong performing original SSP Australia business is going well."",
  ""Critically, the margin profile of our Asia and Middle Eastern businesses has remained strong as we've continued to expand SSP in the region through FY 2024."",
  ""The UK is our heartland, as many of you know, a key priority, for me personally, has been to improve the performance of our home market in every sense."",
  ""What I mean by that is both delivering better propositions for customers and clients and improving our financial performance."",
  ""We set four key priorities, first, resetting the team under the leadership of Kari Daniels."",
  ""Second, rebuilding the quality of our customer propositions and store estates across the UK."",
  ""Third, developing a stronger and more exciting for customer business in the air channel."",
  ""And fourth, deepening and developing existing and new client relationships with both operators and with brand partners."",
  ""We've delivered substantial progress on all of these fronts, which has translated into the strong performance that we delivered in FY 2024, most particularly, as Jonathan said earlier, evident in the second half performance."",
  ""Our actions to refresh and innovate our own as well as our franchise brands is contributing to strong like-for-like sales uplift."",
  ""Some examples of this include the resetting and rebranding of 21 further formerly SSP Pumpkin stores to Café Locals, the continued rollout of premium bar concepts across multiple UK airports and the refurbishment of a further 18 M&S stores, all of this done in FY 2024."",
  ""Allied to this, we've seen a strong uplift in customer satisfaction and customers visiting our stores through Reputation up to 4.6 out of 5, from 4.5 out of 5 last year and only 3.3 out of 5 in 2021."",
  ""The work we have done on our proposition and concepts has been done in tune with what customers and clients are looking for in food travel."",
  ""These actions have driven progressively better, like-for-like sales, strong retentions and further net gains."",
  ""Importantly, the team are also driving now a focused efficiency program which delivered a good step-up in profit and margin in the second half of 2024."",
  ""And we will continue to build on that through 2025 and beyond."",
  ""The work we've done in the UK gives us a strong playbook for further proposition and efficiency development in the UK, but also across the group starting in Continental Europe."",
  ""Our Continental European businesses are an important part of our group."",
  ""We have a long established presence across the Scandinavian countries, in France, in Germany and Belgium, in Switzerland, in Austria and Spain, with strong market share positions in all of these markets."",
  ""As I've made very clear, though, our FY 2024 performance in Continental Europe was both disappointing and behind our expectations."",
  ""We can and will do better here."",
  ""While parts of the business, notably Spain, traded well, we experienced a combination of headwinds and performance challenges across many of our Northern European markets."",
  ""On a market-wide level, but most particularly in Germany, a weaker macroeconomic environment compounded by elevated levels of industrial action and labor cost challenges, which run actually across all of northern Europe, impacted negatively our business."",
  ""The slower post-COVID recovery in the rail sector compared to air, which accounts for about a third of our sales in the region, has left passenger levels below pre-COVID levels."",
  ""Additionally, our regional performance continues to be negatively impacted by our loss-making motorway service station business in Germany, for which we have now contractually agreed a phased exit completing in 2026."",
  ""We've also delivered, though, a significant number of new unit openings."",
  ""The scale of the contract renewal program, predominantly in the Nordics, is unprecedented and resulted in a drag on performance."",
  ""As ever, with mobilization, we experienced disruption and pre-opening costs with performance being reflective of the facts that these units are yet to fully mature."",
  ""However, to be candid, we've had executional issues in the region, too."",
  ""We suffered from this in the summer, where performance in France was behind our expectations during the Paris Olympics."",
  ""Like many, we planned for a step up in demand through July and August."",
  ""What we saw actually was the reverse of this, and having increased our staffing levels in advance of the games, we were unable to take out costs quickly enough."",
  ""The combination So what are we doing?"",
  ""We're on with this and recovering European performance."",
  ""We've changed the leadership model, appointing a new regional CEO, Satya Menard, who joined us in September, and he is leading and driving the plan, which consists of five elements."",
  ""First, acting to drive returns from our recent renewals program weighted towards the Nordic region."",
  ""We've been forensically assessing individual unit performance, identifying any underperforming units and taking action to address them."",
  ""Second, simplifying the organization structure and removing duplication."",
  ""This has resulted in greater transparency and accountability and is also reducing cost."",
  ""Third, driving better operational performance, including menu optimization and procurement disciplines, labor productivity through an acceleration of workforce management tools and lower overhead."",
  ""Fourth, tightly managing the exit from our German motorway service station business ahead of the final exit in 2026."",
  ""We're closing about half of our 60 units this year, the most loss-making ones, in fact."",
  ""And we're mitigating the expected in-year losses across the remainder of this state."",
  ""And finally, driving like-for-like sales through revised propositions combined with the use of digital to build our top line in the region, especially in the under-pressure rail channel."",
  ""Our confidence in this program means that today we're setting a near term regional operating margin target that builds from the 1.6% that we delivered in FY 2024 to approximately 3% in FY 2025 and approximately 5% in the medium term with further progression plans thereafter."",
  ""Now, turning to the outlook for both the current financial year and into the medium term."",
  ""Importantly, we're moving to a new phase in FY 2025, one that builds returns and profitability on the heightened level of recent investment."",
  ""We've tightened our business agenda to enable this."",
  ""So let me just highlight a few elements now."",
  ""We're pushing all of our recently renewed and newly opened units towards maturity and taking action to progress any pockets of underperformance."",
  ""And as I've just talked through, we have a clear recovery plan in place and underway for Continental Europe."",
  ""On cost efficiency, we've got to focus on optimizing menus, automating kitchens, resetting food supply chains, revisiting franchise fees in certain circumstance, and enhancing labor scheduling across the group."",
  ""We have tightened our levels of new capital expenditure with a more normalized pace of new business development, planned and no anticipated new M&A. This will strengthen operating cash flows and free cash flows in the year."",
  ""And finally, we're maintaining our core priority of driving sustainable growth through like-for-like enhancements with profitable organic growth and contract extension."",
  ""Looking specifically then at our planning assumptions for FY 2025."",
  ""Importantly, we build our expectations from the bottom up across our regions and functions, taking into account both headwinds and tailwinds as all of our planned – as well as all of our planned in-year actions."",
  ""In FY 2025, we're planning for group sales, at constant currency to be in the region of £3.7 billion to £3.8 billion, with the growth coming from a 4% to 5% uplift in like-for-like sales, approximately 4% further from net gains and a contribution of 2% to 3% from our recently integrated infill acquisitions."",
  ""We also expect a drag of approximately 2% from the accounting impact of the new Indian joint venture with Adani Airports (sic) [Airport] (00:35:14) and the phased exit from our German motorway service station business."",
  ""With the actions we're taking to drive profitability and returns, we're planning for a group operating profit margin uplift and an operating profit outcome for the year in the range of £230 million to £260 million at constant currency."",
  ""This year-on-year operating profit change is less of the impact of the new Indian joint venture with Adani Airports (sic) [Airport] (00:35:41)."",
  ""We're also setting out today an EPS planning assumption in the range of £0.11 to £0.13 at current rates, a strong year-on-year improvement."",
  ""This planning assumption factors in all of our actions on operating profit and elements of our technical guidance, which are included in the appendix to this presentation."",
  ""Turning now to our near-term capital allocation priorities, which will focus on the areas that will drive the greatest return while ensuring we maintain an efficient balance sheet, one that has net debt to EBITDA between 1.5 and 2 times."",
  ""Our priority is capital investment for organic growth, given our ability to deliver high returns on investment."",
  ""This year we're planning for lower year-on-year value creating CapEx investment in the region of £230 million to £240 million."",
  ""And we don't anticipate further M&A activity in FY 2025."",
  ""Let me say, though, that we're not stepping away from growth opportunities."",
  ""But in the short-term, we're pausing M&A as we focus on delivering value from the elevated level of CapEx and M&A activity in FY 2024."",
  ""As Jonathan has already mentioned, we're proposing to pay a full year dividend at a payout ratio of 35% in line with our target range of between 30% and 40%."",
  ""And furthermore, we expect a material step up in cash flow performance this year and are focused on creating the conditions to return capital to shareholders in the near-term while maintaining leverage in our target range."",
  ""In this set of results, we're introducing return on capital employed as a key performance indicator for the first time."",
  ""We're doing this to highlight our in-year returns on our capital base."",
  ""Importantly, the measure we're introducing, which is set out in our results, adjusts both the numerator and the denominator for joint venture We will progressively build our return on capital employed from this starting point, deliver through strengthening annual profit performance, driving higher returns on our recent investments, and anticipating somewhat lower levels of capital intensity going forward."",
  ""So, FY 2025, in a way, is a year in which we're going to pause for breath somewhat, build returns on all of our recent investments and address the specific challenges that I've outlined already."",
  ""But looking to the medium term, we're today updating our financial framework to give more granular guidance on our medium term performance."",
  ""We expect to achieve annual sales growth of 5% to 7%, comprising like-for-like sales growth of approximately 3%, and net gains of between 2% and 4% with both skewed towards North America, Asia, and the Middle East."",
  ""In terms of profitability, we expect to deliver sustainable operating profit margin enhancement of an average of between 20 basis points and 30 basis points per year post FY 2025, as we benefit from operating leverage, greater use of technology and automation and our wide ranging efficiency program."",
  ""Minority interests are expected to grow in line with the operating profit in the countries with joint venture partnerships."",
  ""Through the medium term, capital investment should be at somewhat lower levels than recent years, with contract renewal and maintenance CapEx to be an average of 4% of group sales, an expansionary CapEx driven by net gains."",
  ""Aligned to this financial framework, we expect to see growth in operating cash flow with enhanced cash conversion and we will continue to pay an ordinary dividend with a target payout ratio of between 30% and 40%."",
  ""The output then of this framework is twofold."",
  ""We expect to deliver sustainable double-digit earnings per share growth for the medium term, and our model targets both deleveraging and significant shareholder return."",
  ""It's been important to us as an executive team and to our board to more explicitly and directly align executive remuneration to these medium term financial objectives."",
  ""Recognizing that SSP is in a different phase now than it was when we introduced the restricted share plan in 2021, earlier this year, we felt it was the right time to reintroduce a performance based long-term incentive plan."",
  ""So having consulted already with shareholders, the proposed new scheme will align executive remuneration with earnings per share, return on capital employed and total shareholder return outcomes."",
  ""So a very quick summary from me before we wrap up for questions."",
  ""We've delivered a good FY 2024 performance in line with our planning assumptions and with three of our four regions having performed well."",
  ""And we have a clear set of actions to recover profitability in Continental Europe."",
  ""Today, we've set clear financial expectations for FY 2025, including at the earnings per share level."",
  ""And importantly, we've seen a positive start to trading in the new year."",
  ""Finally, we're updating our medium term financial framework and aligning our remuneration policy with a focus on delivering outcomes aligned to shareholders expectations."",
  ""With that, Jonathan and I will take questions now.""
]","[
  ""A couple of questions, please."",
  ""Firstly, interested in the introduction of return on capital metric as part of the KPI assessment."",
  ""Obviously, it was sort of a north of 17% last year."",
  ""Where can you see that settling over the medium to longer term?"",
  ""Maybe sort of put that in color with where that has been historically and if there's any sort of regional variations?"",
  ""And secondly, on sort of current trading that sort of 5% like-for-like is lapping what we think will be pretty strong or recovered comps and similar to the second half."",
  ""Do you think that is a sign of what the business can sort of generate going forward, given sort of the investment in formats and products and efficiencies, et cetera?"",
  ""Just firstly, staying with the UK, given the budget, do you think you can keep the good momentum in EBIT margin going this year?"",
  ""And I suppose most obviously what is the Yeah, very much ."",
  ""Jamie Rollo from Morgan Stanley."",
  ""First, just sticking with margins."",
  ""Obviously, very good margins in rest of world, sorry, Secondly, on cash returns, it sounds like this is sort of a year-end potential given that the sort of seasonality of leverage."",
  ""But do you have authority from shareholders already or can you just seek that or wish to seek that at the AGM in advance?"",
  ""And then just general strategic comments on your view on the sort of catering versus retail of a couple of your competitors, obviously Dufry, but also Smith pushing more into your area with that master concessionaire model, is that you seeing any change in the competitive environment?"",
  ""Is that sort of an angle you want to go off to that combined offer?"",
  ""Fintan Ryan here from Goodbody."",
  ""Two questions for me please."",
  ""Although both on sort of related areas."",
  ""For FY 2025, can you give us a sense of what you're expecting for inflation at the aggregate level for both food and raw materials and also labor notwithstanding the recent UK budget?"",
  ""And then secondly, within the mid-term 20 basis points to 30 basis points margin improvement."",
  ""So I get some of the moving parts at the regional level."",
  ""But at the group level, what should we think about contribution from gross margins, labor costs and concession fees within that sort of the next three years to four years?"",
  ""It's Harry Gowers from JPMorgan."",
  ""Just one question, if I can."",
  ""So, good to see that the detail, in terms of improving the performance."",
  ""And get into a 5% margin would obviously be significantly higher than the figure just reported."",
  ""But that is still lower than historical levels, which I think was 8% or 9%."",
  ""So I guess, is Europe, structurally impaired versus history just anything in terms of the moving parts over time, not just the one-offs from the last 12 months?"",
  ""Just on the medium-term like-for-like assumptions that 3%, is that all volume or all price or how are you thinking about that?"",
  ""And then, can we just talk about Taking your foot off the gas there?"",
  ""And at what point would you think about reentering the market there?"",
  ""I just had three questions, if I may."",
  ""My first question is on North America."",
  ""I think, in the slides, you stated it was 15% constant currency growth in the first eight weeks."",
  ""I wondered if you could give some color on what you're seeing in terms of customer behavior and like-for-like trends of – I appreciate we've had a few weather impacts... ...so, excluding that?"",
  ""And then, secondly, on the extension of the average contract length, I wondered if you could just give some color on, are you guys – are you seeing that being extended because you're going into markets where the average contract length tends to be longer, or are you securing longer contracts with on renewal in existing or more mature markets as well?"",
  ""And then, maybe just a quick one on CapEx, Jonathan, I wondered if you could remind us of how much CapEx for this year includes some of that deferred maintenance spend from COVID and how far through we are with that?"",
  ""James Rowland Clark from Barclays."",
  ""I've got two questions, please."",
  ""The first is on like-for-likes of 5% in the current trading versus 6% in Q4."",
  ""Can you give any regional color on the strengths, weaknesses, slowdowns, speedups there, and then also cost – sort of price versus volume for that 5%?"",
  ""And second, on your outlook guidance on like-for-likes, it looks to be a little bit higher than expectation."",
  ""So, is that volume or price driven?"",
  ""Greg, we'll start with you there."",
  ""Let me just kind of give a kind of point almost on how to put it."",
  ""The philosophy of why we're introducing return on capital employed and I'll let Jonathan talk about it in a bit more detail then."",
  ""I joined the business that is very, very good at individual capital allocation decisions."",
  ""And Jonathan and his team over frankly decades have built a way of assessing individual prospective capital projects through a process you've heard me talk about before, which is our group investment committee."",
  ""Somewhat surprisingly though, we didn't aggregate all that together into a single external measure on return on capital employed in the year and I thought we needed to do that."",
  ""And in particular, we needed to do that in a way that netted out the different impacts of our different ownership structures in different parts of the world, and gave us sort of a single integrating measure of what the return on capital for Sure."",
  ""So if you were to look back to the pre-COVID period, our return on capital employed would have been for the preceding couple of years, a little north of 20%."",
  ""But it's worth remembering that the business has changed a fair amount since then."",
  ""A couple of factors are quite important."",
  ""One is clearly the rail sector isn't as big as it was back then and as you might imagine, the rail sector historically had had lower levels of capital investment."",
  ""Part of that is due to the landlord and tenant protection in the UK rail estate, which is a big part of the rail business and that would have generated quite high returns on capital employed compared to other bits of the business and that's now somewhat smaller, proportionately and clearly hasn't fully recovered."",
  ""And the other point is that period, we also saw some quite big new contract wins in North America, some of which had a very slow phasing of the capital investment."",
  ""So there are a number of reasons why I don't think you can jump straight back to those sort of levels."",
  ""I think if you process the medium term guidance that Patrick has just spoken about, you would probably see over the medium term returns on capital employed heading back towards something in the region of 20%."",
  ""But again, Do you want to talk maybe just on current trading and sustainability of the 5% like-for-like?"",
  ""So I think there are a number of swings and roundabouts."",
  ""So I think we've basically said that we think something like 4% to 5% is the range of like-for-like for the coming year."",
  ""We're trading very slightly ahead of that."",
  ""I think the comparatives are relatively flat, if I look at the previous year."",
  ""With one exception, which is that we saw more strike action in the first half, which impacted the rail business."",
  ""So in a sense, the comps are slightly easier in the first half than the second half, hence an expectation that we might see like-for-likes a 1 percentage point lower in the second half."",
  ""I think the only additional point I'd make is that particularly in the UK, where we see high labor costs in the second half,  to the recent budget, I do expect that probably to flow through into pricing at some level in common with the rest of the industry, which might again just help flatten out the sort of H1, H2 trajectory."",
  ""But we think that's a reasonable expectation based on what we're seeing today."",
  ""Tim, I might jump to you next."",
  ""I mean, on the – you've referenced UK and Europe."",
  ""I might just broaden this out slightly."",
  ""You've heard us and indeed sort of a kind of SSP narrative over the last little while has been to kind of aggregate the UK and Europe in kind of one bundle of, how to put it, problem children."",
  ""And what you should take from these results is that we still have problems that we need to fix in Europe and we still have the potential to make the UK better."",
  ""But actually we're in very different places."",
  ""And some of you may remember when I started two-and-a-half years ago that I was in the eyes of some internal and external observers of SSP quite critical of our UK business."",
  ""That was grounded by the way in my previous experience as a supplier to SSP, as well as my knowledge of some of the brand partners and client partners and how they thought about SSP in the UK."",
  ""And to be blunt, it was also grounded in my experience as a customer of travelling around the UK rail network and UK airports."",
  ""I just didn't think our business was in a good place in the UK in terms of how we served customers when I joined."",
  ""I feel very differently about where our UK business is today."",
  ""The work that the team we've put in place, I mentioned So the outcome of all of that is that you are seeing a very strong step-up in financial performance in the UK that's most evident in the second half."",
  ""We're not at the finish line at all."",
  ""We can keep cracking on from here and we will and I would expect us to continue to strengthen the performance in the UK and that is a good thing."",
  ""It's a huge contributor to shareholder return, but it's also where we have to showcase SSP at its best."",
  ""It's our home and heartland market, as you heard me say earlier."",
  ""I don't want to do too much of a read across in terms of the specific initiatives from the UK to Europe."",
  ""But some of those principles will be parts of what we're doing, getting the team right, getting the proposition right, doing some of this heavy lifting in terms of channel mix and exiting from the loss-making German business."",
  ""I mean, obviously 1.5% or 1.6% return on sales is totally unacceptable for us as a business."",
  ""We have a very clear line of sight as to how we build that to approximately 3% this year and we know we need to do that."",
  ""But of course, that's not victory either, right?"",
  ""We need to push on from there."",
  ""But we did want to frame the size, I don't know if I just frame it in one last way, getting to 5% from 1.5% of the current sales level of our business generates £40 million of incremental EBIT for – which flows through at something like 4P of earnings."",
  ""So it's a big prize getting this done and it's got an appropriate level of attention in terms of how we're doing that."",
  ""Tim B, there's all sorts of moving parts in Europe between pace of getting value from renewals and speed of exit."",
  ""We've got to do each of the five things that I mentioned well and that's what we're going to do."",
  ""So Jonathan, do you want to pick up?"",
  "" We're seeing that – again, we would anticipate, given these are industry-wide phenomena, we will have to move pricing to generally mitigate the impact and the rest of the hospitality industry is going to be doing the same."",
  ""And it's – as I say, it's built into our planning assumptions In terms of Continental Europe, getting to your point, the overall impacts of the renewals program is something, year-on-year and potentially something in the region of £5 million to £10 million, but that weighted towards the Nordics."",
  ""Just to give you a sort of flavor of the impact that we might see from that as we look into next year."",
  ""In terms of TFS, the – just to sort of reiterate the points I made before and again, there is a slide the back of the deck you can see."",
  ""Again The accounting is the accounting, I'm afraid we will no longer consolidate that and that will therefore, as we've set out, I won't go through the numbers again impact the reported P&L. But important to note that it's now coming – the profit delivery will now come through the associates line, albeit it is complicated because there are some management service fees because we continue to operate this, which will flow into the headline profit."",
  ""Did that cover your questions on TFS Tim?"",
  ""So it will also mean – sorry."",
  ""It will also mean that we no longer consolidate some of the cash that sits within that particular business unit, within the joint venture."",
  ""But that we knew, but that is what you see in the normal course of events."",
  ""Let me try and push through that."",
  ""So, I mean, just starting with your point on margins."",
  ""We're focusing on trying to push margins forward at the group level and there would be initiatives everywhere you try to do that."",
  ""I think the starting point in our Asia and Middle Eastern businesses is I think, the a good answer in that region because there will be some accounting margin effect to what Jonathan has just described in India, would be keeping it at that sort of mid-teens level."",
  ""And North America is on a very, very good path in terms of progressing profitability and EBIT margin."",
  ""And we would – we'd want to see that continue to move forward from a healthy base."",
  ""And then you've got different dynamics in other parts, I mean, clearly we need a massive margin reset in Europe from a starting point of 1.5% to 1.6%."",
  ""And you've heard me talk about that already."",
  ""And I think the path we're on in this, that you see in the second half in the UK is quite encouraging in terms of where we're moving in margins."",
  ""And if I just move to cash return, I think you kind of – apart from this sort of decision rates point, you've sort of identified where our perspective is, right."",
  ""But let me just be very, very direct on that."",
  ""I probably would like for us to have been able to have announced the share buyback today."",
  ""But I think we have to be cognizant of the leverage range that we've given and recognize, as Jonathan outlined a couple of times in the presentation, this first half, second half dynamic issue."",
  ""So I think we need to – we feel very good about where we think leverage will be at the full year."",
  ""But we do need to trade the first half – and with this first half, second half split and see where that sets us."",
  ""And I don't think anyone would thank us for going early on that and then suddenly having – being towards the higher end of that 1.5 to 2 times range in the first half."",
  ""So the sentiments you should take from what we've said and what we've written is we would like to get to a place to be able to do that, but it's a nudge too early, it's how I would describe it."",
  ""And then the third point on strategic comment, I mean I want to be just quick here, and we like the parts of the market we're in."",
  ""We think hospitality and F&B is frankly a better place to be than retail and travel locations."",
  ""And we are investing quite a bit to be relevant in the grab and go portion of food."",
  ""And so you see that with most visibly in the UK with our M&S store estate."",
  ""But you'll also see it with things like points, with some, partnering we do, frankly, with WHSmith in some markets."",
  ""And I think you'll see us continue to be relevant and maybe even more relevant at that intersection of, convenience, food retailing with F&B, where you won't see us touching is luxury retail and duty free."",
  ""It's just a different thing, different capability."",
  ""And others, I think sometimes talk about wanting to have, fully integrated and hybrid offers."",
  ""And what they really mean is, they want to be an F&B. That's a more attractive part of the business than convenience retailing or duty free, which I think it is."",
  ""And so we're kind of happy where we are and we want to deliver for customers and clients Jon, will you pick up both of those?"",
  ""So first of all, in terms of inflation, our expectations are for generally easing food cost inflation pretty much around the group, actually."",
  ""So generally in the region of sort of 3%, thereabouts, certainly in our planning assumption."",
  ""However in aggregate, we're still assuming that labor inflation is going to be in the region of sort of 5% to 6% and that's built into our expectations."",
  ""For the reasons, I just mentioned in response to Tim about the UK, so I won't drain that again."",
  ""But clearly the national minimum wage is going up in the second half by I think 6.7% here."",
  ""The other region to call out is North America, where we continue to see high levels of average hourly rate inflation and to some degree still supply side shortages in terms of labor in the hospitality industry generally, as well as challenges from unionization."",
  ""So that's the other real area of pressure."",
  ""So that really covers and but that is all essentially built into our planning assumptions and as ever we are looking to mitigate that cost inflation where appropriate through efficiency programs and through pricing."",
  ""In terms of the 20 basis points to 30 basis points of long-term margin accretion, we're not giving guidance precisely on where that will come from."",
  ""But as ever, I think you'd expect to see some contribution from the efficiency programs across all of the P&L, but predictably with the focus on gross margin, which is what you would see if you looked at long run history pre-COVID, that's where a lot of that margin expansion came from."",
  ""And of course, what we're doing is planning really to have sufficient efficiency initiatives to mitigate and beat the long Harry."",
  ""I mean, I'd hesitate to use the language of structurally impaired."",
  ""But Europe is different than before."",
  ""And the – we've pointed to the fact that we're exiting motorway service stations, which was a part of Europe before."",
  ""We've also – I think it would be fair to assume that the sort of baseline level of rail and air performance has reset and we're in the normal now."",
  ""It – they may move up or down from Yeah."",
  ""7.5% is basically where we were in 2019."",
  ""So the gap isn't that quite big."",
  ""And again, worth remembering that, the business has changed a lot since 2019."",
  ""And therefore, as Patrick said Yeah."",
  ""And what we're trying to find the balance on here is."",
  ""What are some of the really effective practices and capabilities of SSP that would have been evident in 2019 delivery in some markets and can we replicate those."",
  ""But also, we would be mad as a consumer business to start to force fit consumers into behavior of six years ago."",
  ""So we have to figure out where food travel is actually happening and make sure that we're relevant against that."",
  ""I'll try to jump in."",
  ""I think it would be fair to assume that the medium-term guidance assumes a more historically normal level of inflation."",
  ""In other words, much lower, right."",
  ""So, if you were to run with 3%, 4% inflation, then the like-for-like would be higher, right."",
  ""And so – and that's probably the best way of describing it."",
  ""I mean, I think our philosophy in this medium-term guidance is we want to give people a baseline around how to think about how the business progresses, right?"",
  ""And we could have a, we could have an assumption around each of the individual lines and a debate around is it too high or too low?"",
  ""We think in net terms, what we do is a further reset in the earnings per share trajectory of the business in 2025 and 2024."",
  ""And then an ability to sustainably deliver double-digit earnings per share growth after that, right."",
  ""On your point on cash, the business should become more cash generative, partly because I think the run rate capital CapEx level is lower than what you've seen in the last two years because of this more normalized level of renewal activity, point one."",
  ""And secondly, the kind of completion of the unwind to some of these COVID effects around rental accruals means that we should revert to being a modestly negative working capital business as we grow."",
  ""And those two things should be helpful to the operating cash flow and free cash flow of the business and the deleveraging of the business."",
  ""And some of the points I referenced in Jamie's question to me about capital return earlier."",
  ""On your last question on strategy, listen, this is a dynamic growing market."",
  ""There's tons of opportunities out there for organic and inorganic growth."",
  ""They'll still be there in a year's time and two years' time and three years' time, given the level of infrastructure investment that's been put into particular the air channel, in particular in the markets that we've highlighted."",
  ""I think in terms of the – what we need to do in 2025, a tighter focus on getting the returns from this elevated level of recent investment, be it CapEx or M&A and really nailing that in 2025 makes a lot of sense."",
  ""But that doesn't – but don't interpret that as a change in how we think about strategy or how we think we create value over time."",
  ""There is no art, do we see any material opportunity cost, as you put us to that level of focus on 2025."",
  ""Just those questions So, when we look at the different constituent parts of how we're growing in America between this elevated level of net gains and this big new airport acquisition program that we're under, the integration of M&A and like-for-like, the net of that feels quite good for us in terms of growth, but we do observe quite marked movements for different factors if you look at it on a very, very short term basis is how I would describe it."",
  ""But the important thing is that the aggregate momentum of those things is building a bigger and bigger business where we have more and more space into which to step as our biggest traditional competitor sees a number of their very, very large airport units come up for tender, some of which has already happened and some of which is impending, and that's space for us to step into."",
  ""I mean, on extensions, I think it's yes to both of your hypothesis, actually."",
  ""Firstly, the regional mix of how we're growing and in particular where we're putting our net gain activity is weighted towards markets that have longer term contracts."",
  ""I could bring us back to North America again in talking about that, but the same will be true in Saudi, the same will be true in some of the South East Asian markets that we've referenced."",
  ""But I think it's also true that everywhere in the air channel, there is a momentum to increase contract length."",
  ""Some of that, by the way, is a function of some of the negotiations that Jonathan referenced in the presentation actually, which is, where you have more challenged economics, part of the solution to that is not to have to refresh the capital every three, four years."",
  ""And actually, the airport sector increasingly gets that."",
  ""And I think if you – you'll have all of your own sources on this anyway."",
  ""But there is an upward momentum in length of contracts that's evident in every market, and our business is – with our business mix, we – you see an even kind of stronger progression for us in that respect."",
  ""Do you want to pick up either of those, but then I'll also talk about CapEx?"",
  ""I mean, just one point to add really, agree with everything what Patrick said, of course, that clearly the sheer scale of the renewals program over the last couple of years has given us a little bit more remaining contract term just because even if we weren't actually, as Patrick's described, extending those contracts on average, that in itself secures a little bit of extra term."",
  ""But it's a combination of factors."",
  ""In terms of the CapEx, straightforward, pretty much in line with what we've said to you before, there is still the very tail end of that sort of COVID catchup investment in this coming year."",
  ""And we figure that's probably somewhere in the region of £15 million to £20 million of the overall program that we've talked about, the £230 million to £240 million of guidance."",
  ""But, that is then it's and I think we're back into the normal course of business when it comes to capital investment."",
  ""Jonathan, do you want to...?"",
  "" So, if you look at the current trading, in broad terms, holding up very well in the UK, helped actually by a continued good performance from the Marks and Spencer Simply Food franchise and very consistent actually what they're seeing in the high street."",
  ""It's remained reasonably healthy, as you'd expect, in Asia and the Middle East."",
  ""It is a little bit softer in the round in North America, but also in parts of Continental Europe."",
  ""But clearly, the fact that it's only running at 5% compared to 6% says that none of those are massive shifts."",
  ""And Patrick's commented on some of the volatility that we've seen in North America."",
  ""In terms of cost – price versus volume, I mean, not much change, really, as I say, I think we'd entered a period of to some degree stability around cost inflation compared to what we've seen over the last couple of years, and therefore had to reflect in pricing, which we've talked about at great length."",
  ""Clearly, in the UK, as we look to the rest of the year, I think that debate will probably surface again as people confront the increases in the national minimum wage and the changes in the NI regime."",
  ""But, I mean, that probably covers it, quite frankly."",
  ""I don't think we're looking at any great change."",
  ""I mean, it's probably ever so slightly less price... Yes...  ...in Q1 than would have been the case in Q4 as we begin to lap the price increases we've put through in the previous year."",
  ""So, volume, I suspect, is pretty similar to be honest with you, James."",
  ""I mean, I think the – it's very difficult to have a market comparison for the kind of business that we are with the geographic mix that we have."",
  ""So, the best answer I can give is the points that we made as we set out the planning assumptions for FY 2025, which is we build this in detailed bottom up, market by market, channel by channel, and typically unit by unit."",
  ""And so, we're very conscious of the need to make sure that our outcomes reflect how we've guided."",
  ""And I think we feel right now that the 4% to 5% guidance for the full year on like-for-like is about right."",
  ""Listen, I think we might – we'll finish up there."",
  ""I  for staying with us."",
  ""We had a lot to cover today."",
  ""And we're very happy to follow up both with you individually and with your clients as need be over the next few days and weeks."",
  ""But I  for being with us this morning."",
  ""And if I don't get a chance to do this to everyone, I wish you for a couple of weeks' time, happy Christmas.""

  "", Brian, and hello, everyone."",
  ""At the midpoint of the year, we're pleased with our continued progress."",
  ""Our revenue and profit performance are in line with our expectations, our investments are starting to pay-off, and we remain confident in our full year trajectory."",
  ""We're working to deliver compounding growth and material margin expansion over time."",
  ""Our knowledge businesses remain recession tolerant."",
  ""Our balance sheet and cash flow remain core strengths, and we're starting to see AI-related tailwinds."",
  ""I know you may have questions about the political environment in the US."",
  ""It's too early to speculate on any impact, positive or negative, that a new administration could have."",
  ""I'll just say this: the scientific exchange and global R&D investment have always risen above the changing political tides, given their vital importance to economic growth and quality of life."",
  ""Research and learning remain the twin foundations of the global knowledge economy, and Wiley is enabling them through the creation of new knowledge and its application."",
  ""We have become a most trusted source in an ever-changing world that is overloaded with unsubstantiated information and skepticism."",
  ""We remain confident, as ever, in our central role of ensuring the accuracy, trust, impact, and application of knowledge."",
  ""It's getting more important by the day."",
  ""Let me also welcome Chris Caridi to his first official ."",
  ""Chris has assumed the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer in September."",
  ""He's been our controller for eight years, and continues to be a trusted partner to me and our leadership team."",
  ""I'll give him a more proper introduction later in my presentation."",
  ""Okay, let's review the headlines this quarter."",
  ""Revenue growth was driven primarily by Learning, which saw favorable market conditions across both Academic and Professional."",
  ""Research generated modest growth, driven by positive demand trends, partially offset by a large year-on-year decline in legacy print and licensing revenue."",
  ""Chris will speak to our segment performance in more detail."",
  ""Margin expansion and EPS growth were notable this quarter."",
  ""On AI, we're moving decisively but methodically, structuring and expanding our available content and data catalogs, formalizing business development teams and pipelines, and developing publishing and other tools."",
  ""There were no announced projects this quarter, but we are confident in both our pipeline and our progress."",
  ""We made some recent leadership changes to move faster and more effectively as an organization."",
  ""I'll talk about them in a later section."",
  ""We are advancing a culture of continuous improvement where we constantly evaluate the effectiveness of our spending and eliminate waste in all forms, where every investment is rigorously scrutinized and where we pivot without doubt or mercy, as they say."",
  ""Let's review how we delivered on our key objectives this quarter."",
  ""As a reminder, our first is to drive recovery and growth in Research."",
  ""We began the year with a 4% top line growth in Research Publishing and saw growth moderate this quarter due to the year-over-year swing in our legacy products, as I discussed."",
  ""It's important to note that quarterly performance can fluctuate due to onetime items and other timing issues, and it's far more relevant to look at us on a full year basis."",
  ""The core of the business continues to perform well, driven by gold open access and our institutional models."",
  ""Demand to publish remains strong."",
  ""We recently commenced our calendar year 2025 journal renewal season with research libraries and consortia around the world."",
  ""It's too early to report numbers, but we see a healthy environment for our combined institutional models."",
  ""The Indian government recently approved a One Nation, One Subscription program, representing over 6,000 research institutions."",
  ""So, instead of reaching only a portion of these institutions through regional subscription agreements, we'll now have one national license to service directly and provide read access to scholarly journal content."",
  ""We're not ready to talk about incremental benefit, but we're encouraged by this development and India's 40% growth in article submissions."",
  ""Finally, we're cautious but pleased with the incremental improvement we're seeing in our solutions business with new leadership there and moderately improved market conditions."",
  ""Our second objective is to move decisively on near-term AI opportunities."",
  ""Year-to-date, we've realized the full $21 million of the previously announced rights project."",
  ""We also have a healthy pipeline of pharma and other R&D-centric companies exploring content and data for their internal AI applications."",
  ""A recent example is a targeted agreement with a large pharmaceutical company for access to specific journal titles."",
  ""They will use this content and data to power internal drug discovery through AI."",
  ""Our third objective is to drive continued profit improvement."",
  ""Through the half, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS were up 17% and 47%, and our adjusted EBITDA margin was up 220 basis points over prior year."",
  ""Finally, all divestitures are officially complete."",
  ""Note, I'll be excluding divested assets in my commentary unless otherwise noted."",
  ""Revenue was up 3%, driven by Learning growth of 7% and Research growth of 1%."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA rose 14% to $106 million due to revenue performance and run rate cost savings."",
  ""These savings were partially offset by investments in Research."",
  ""Our adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 24.9%, up from 22.7% last year."",
  ""Our Q2 margin is not a run rate number at this point, but it does demonstrate our underlying earnings power as we continue to drive for improved efficiency."",
  ""Adjusted EPS was up 36% due to higher adjusted operating income and accrued interest income from our divestitures."",
  ""A few words about our GAAP performance."",
  ""The GAAP revenue decline was impacted by foregone revenue from sold businesses."",
  ""The significant GAAP EPS increase was primarily due to prior-year impairments and restructuring charges."",
  ""Let's talk about our leadership changes, starting with finance."",
  ""As noted, Chris assumed the role of Interim Chief Financial Officer in mid-September."",
  ""He has been our Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer since 2017, and has been a very steady hand ever since."",
  ""Chris has over 30 years in the industry with top finance executive roles at multiple public companies."",
  ""He and I, and the rest of the leadership team, will be focusing on further optimizing our cost structure and improving our capital efficiency and decision-making."",
  ""We eliminated the CTO position and are combining the technology and operations organizations under Andrew Weber, our Head of Operations since 2021."",
  ""Andrew is already leading the Research end-to-end platform and enterprise modernization projects, in addition to running the traditional operations function."",
  ""Prior to Wiley, Andrew headed both technology and operations for several large publishers."",
  ""He's a proven leader and a proven economizer with a very strong financial acumen."",
  ""Andrew, Chris, and I will be looking very hard at our technology spend and existing infrastructure."",
  ""Finally, marketing has become an important differentiator given the business model shifts in Research."",
  ""Anna Reeves joined Wiley in 2023 to lead our marketing efforts, and she's made an immediate impact in building state-of-the-art digital marketing capabilities, attracting authors, and increasing the top of the submissions funnel."",
  ""Anna will assume the position of Chief Marketing Officer and join the executive leadership team, representing another voice of the customer when we make key business and strategic decisions."",
  ""I want to take this opportunity to thank Christina Van Tassell and Aref Matin for their service as CFO and CTO, respectively."",
  ""Let's turn to the AI opportunity."",
  ""As a reminder, we see it in three pillars: productivity, publishing innovation, and licensing and application."",
  ""We have surveyed our authors, enterprise customers, LLM developers, and colleagues."",
  ""The findings show widespread needs but an early market, and we are recognized as a company at the forefront of this paradigm shift."",
  ""Wiley has succeeded for 217 years because it not only embraced and benefited from technological and business model change, but helped propel it forward."",
  ""That's what a knowledge company does."",
  ""On productivity, we accelerated our pace this quarter in deploying multiple tools for our employees, enabling them to drive their personal productivity."",
  ""Can we materially reduce our large administrative burden?"",
  ""Certainly, and we're seeing it already in our early adopters."",
  ""On publishing innovation, we're focused on publishing efficiency, content creation, and research integrity."",
  ""Jay, Andrew, and I are obsessive about publishing efficiency and cycle time."",
  ""In our industry, it can take six to nine months to accept and publish a scientific article, two years for a new professional book title, and three years for an advanced textbook."",
  ""We are applying AI to reduce these cycle times, which will result in more publishing volume at lower cost and, importantly, a much improved author experience."",
  ""But this will take time to achieve as we work to perfect these AI tools, which, as you know, can have accuracy issues."",
  ""We're also using AI to detect fraudulent research, and are working with several partners to commercialize this capability."",
  ""Finally, at the Frankfurt Book Fair in October, we announced the launch of a co-innovation program to develop new AI applications in partnership with R&D-centric companies."",
  ""Our first announced partner is Potato, a startup building out an AI research assistant for biology."",
  ""On licensing and applications, we realized $44 million of licensing revenue to-date and continue to build out a robust pipeline."",
  ""As a reminder, our high quality content and data in science, medicine, technology, engineering, and business is foundational for training large language models, and also in demand for vertical-specific models in industries like tech, pharma, and information services."",
  ""As the market is rapidly developing and iterating, it's difficult to size the addressable market for licensing."",
  ""It's a bit like the Wild West at the moment, but we are actively in the market and learning in real-time along with our large corporate customers."",
  ""Again, we're confident in our direction of travel, but it will take time to develop some of these opportunities."",
  ""On the application front, besides the co-innovation program I just referenced, we've recently partnered with the School of Engineering at Arizona State University on a Gen AI-powered tutor to help students succeed in their computer science labs."",
  ""The purpose of the AI tutor is to provide immediate feedback to students who have hit a barrier in their zyBooks coding lab."",
  ""This pilot is another example of Wiley collaborating with others to couple knowledge and application with AI capabilities."",
  ""Let's talk about the importance of reinvestment after several years of underfunding our profitable core businesses."",
  ""As a reminder, we are reinvesting around half of our previously executed cost savings and all of the proceeds from our Q1 AI project into several key areas to drive compounding growth and further margin improvement in the years ahead."",
  ""First, we're investing to drive incremental growth in Research where we have a unique right to win."",
  ""Our aim is to increase Research Publishing market share and exceed market growth of 3% to 4% over time."",
  ""We're investing to expand our editorial capacity to meet the demand to publish, expand our journal portfolio, and optimize our go-to-market efforts to drive author engagement and retention."",
  ""So, how are we progressing?"",
  ""Our investments in journal brands and marketing capabilities are driving submissions growth of 18% and output growth of 7%."",
  ""However, a very important reminder is that output does not automatically convert to incremental revenue growth."",
  ""Much of this volume goes to supporting our multi-year subscriptions and transformational agreements, which remain the foundation of the business."",
  ""While not a one-for-one, this volume allows us to strengthen and increase the value of these recurring revenue models."",
  ""That said, we are encouraged by demand recovery in mature markets where acceptance rates are higher, along with strong growth in emerging markets."",
  ""We are seeing good momentum in our strategy to build out our top journal brands, notably our Advanced Collection."",
  ""This flagship portfolio consists of 22 high impact journal titles."",
  ""This year we're launching two new journals focused on AI, Advanced Intelligent Discovery and Advanced Robotics Research, and additional journals in areas of strategic importance in the life and health sciences will follow."",
  ""Top brands are often what differentiate the top publishers, and Advanced is a gold standard."",
  ""We're also investing to transform our publishing and author experience through our Research Publishing platform."",
  ""We've migrated a large number of journals to-date and continue to make progress in our development work."",
  ""This platform will allow us to deliver new content offerings and improve cost per article and article transfer."",
  ""During the quarter, we started a pilot, new referrer and transfer capabilities and research exchange review before rolling it out to all journals."",
  ""This technology uses AI to match articles to journals, giving a better experience to authors, reviewers, and editors alike."",
  ""Finally, we're reinvesting in AI growth and productivity, as noted in rights management and business development, and in working to make content available and structured for prospective and existing LLM developers."",
  ""So, there's a lot happening."",
  ""Our focus continues to be on driving margin expansion while reinvesting in sustainable growth initiatives."",
  ""I'll turn the call over to Chris now to talk about our segment performance, outlook, and financial position."",
  ""As I said last quarter, we're off to a good start, but we're not declaring victory."",
  ""We have a lot more work to do to achieve our full revenue and margin potential, which will be a multi-year effort."",
  ""Still, we remain confident in core demand trends and other performance indicators, our execution, and our alignment as an organization."",
  ""We're making good progress in margin improvement with more to come."",
  ""We're an early mover in AI."",
  ""We're one of the first publishers to close a large licensing deal with LLM developers; and we're early to market on AI-driven research fraud detection."",
  ""We're an early adopter of Salesforce's Agentforce for our customer service optimization."",
  ""They even cited our example on their recent ."",
  ""We're working through various opportunities, and feel good about the pipeline and our execution in this area."",
  ""We have a leaner, more focused executive team now, and we're off and running."",
  ""Our performance to-date is as expected and we're confident in achieving our outlook."",
  ""Continuous improvement is our multi-year drumbeat."",
  ""We're reinvesting where we have competitive advantage and operating leverage, and we're continuously evaluating our cost structure."",
  ""This is not a one- or two-year trajectory; it's a continuum."",
  ""I'll finish by thanking our Wiley colleagues for everything they do to make Wiley, Wiley; a historically significant company at the forefront of change, a company doing good in the world."",
  "" all for joining us today."",
  ""I want to wish you and your families are safe and happy holiday season."",
  ""I'll now open the floor to any comments and questions."",
  ""I'm with Matt Kissner, Wiley's President and CEO; Christopher Caridi, Interim CFO; and Jay Flynn, Executive Vice President and General Manager of Research and Learning."",
  ""Note that our comments and responses reflect management's views as of today and will include forward-looking statements."",
  ""Actual results may differ materially from those statements."",
  ""The company does not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect subsequent events."",
  ""Also, Wiley provides non-GAAP measures as a supplement to evaluate underlying operating profitability and performance trends."",
  ""These measures do not have standardized meanings prescribed by US GAAP and, therefore, may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies; nor should they be viewed as alternatives to measures under GAAP."",
  ""Unless otherwise noted, we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call and variances are on a year-over-year basis and will exclude divested assets and the impact of currency."",
  ""Additional information is included in our filings with the SEC."",
  ""A copy of this presentation and transcript will be available on our Investor Relations webpage and investors.wiley.com."",
  ""I'll now turn the call over to Matt Kissner."",
  "", Matt, and hello, everyone."",
  ""As Matt noted, our results are in line with expectations and we remain confident in our full year revenue, profit, and cash flow outlook, although there is some unusual quarterly phasing to discuss."",
  ""Let's start with Research performance."",
  ""Second quarter and year-to-date revenue were up 1% and 2%, respectively."",
  ""For the quarter, Research Publishing growth of 1% was driven by growth in Gold Open Access in our institutional models, offsetting an unusually large quarterly swing of $5 million in legacy print and licensing revenue."",
  ""Legacy revenue includes many different smaller products such as backfiles, article pay-per-view, digital archives, and title-by-title sales to libraries."",
  ""The vast majority of this revenue is nonrecurring and so it tends to be very uneven."",
  ""Legacy performance this quarter was largely due to unfavorable comps, notably a onetime backfile deal in the prior year."",
  ""Research Publishing is largely a recurring revenue business, dominated by multi-year licenses to Research institutions in the form of subscriptions and transformational agreements."",
  ""We're in the early stages of the calendar 2025 renewal season, but we feel good about what we're seeing so far."",
  ""We've already renewed several transformational agreements, including with one of our largest library consortia, and are making good progress on our overall goals here."",
  ""The renewal season runs from now until March-April 2025."",
  ""Research Solutions continued to improve this quarter, with revenue growth of 2% driven by career centers, managed services, and databases."",
  ""This offset softness in advertising."",
  ""We anticipate continued improvement for this business in the second half, driven by new products and our society business pipeline."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for Research rose 1%, driven by revenue performance, offset by reinvestment in the growth and productivity initiatives that Matt touched on earlier."",
  ""Our Q2 margin was 31.3% compared to 31.6% in the prior-year period."",
  ""Year-to-date, it was 30.3% versus 30.7% in the prior year."",
  ""To summarize, we are confident in our continued growth and improvement in Research and in the reinvestments we're making to drive long-term success."",
  ""We remain confident in our full year outlook for Research."",
  ""Learning continues to perform well."",
  ""Q2 revenue rose 7%, or 5% excluding AI, driven by growth in both academic and professional."",
  ""Academic was up 5%, or 3% excluding AI, driven by continued double-digit growth in our zyBooks STEM courseware, inclusive access, and licensing, offsetting continued print declines."",
  ""Year-to-date, academic was up 12%, or 4% excluding AI."",
  ""After a down Q1, Professional had a very good quarter, with revenue up 11%, or 8% excluding AI."",
  ""We saw a positive online retail environment with improved store inventory levels and sell-through, and we're benefiting from publishing more frontlist titles in high demand categories."",
  ""Most importantly, we've accelerated our pace in signing new titles, the most we secured in years."",
  ""This bodes well for future revenue growth in this business."",
  ""Professional publishing is a great example of where our targeted investment is starting to pay off."",
  ""We're not declaring victory yet, as this business tends to be more cyclical than others, but we're certainly encouraged."",
  ""Finally, on the assessment side, which includes personality profile and team building offerings, we saw low single-digit growth this quarter due to a soft corporate spending environment."",
  ""Year-to-date, Professional was up 8%, or 1% excluding AI."",
  ""To summarize, the Learning team continues to execute well, driving both revenue growth and over 500 basis points of margin improvement this quarter compared to the prior year."",
  ""Year-to-date, our adjusted EBITDA margin was 35.2% versus 29.1%."",
  ""It's an example of what a more focused Wiley can accomplish."",
  ""Corporate expenses were flat this quarter or up slightly year-to-date, with higher tech spending for enterprise modernization offsetting lower executive severance costs and cost savings."",
  ""As a reminder, these corporate expenses are not allocated to the business."",
  ""Corporate expenses are certainly an area that we'll be looking at going forward."",
  ""Let's talk about the remainder of the year."",
  ""First, it's important to look at us on a full year basis rather than by quarter."",
  ""To that end, we anticipate an uneven second half, with Q3 challenged and Q4 elevated."",
  ""Through the first half, revenue is up 2% and our adjusted EBITDA margin is up 220 basis points to 21.9%."",
  ""In the second half, a significant portion of our fiscal year revenue and profit growth is expected in Q4."",
  ""This is due to strong momentum and favorable comparisons in Research."",
  ""As a reminder, Research revenue and adjusted EBITDA were down last Q4 due to the timing of certain journal renewals and market headwinds in our Solutions business."",
  ""This year, we're seeing strong momentum in Publishing and improvement in Solutions."",
  ""This, along with underlying growth in our core Learning business, is expected to offset the $23 million onetime AI deal in Q4 of the prior year."",
  ""Q3 is typically a lighter quarter due to seasonal fluctuations in Learning revenue and will be challenged by our current year investments."",
  ""That said, we are reaffirming our full year guidance across all metrics, given our first half performance and leading indicators."",
  ""Let me quickly summarize our full year outlook."",
  ""We're projecting full year revenue of $1.65 billion to $1.69 billion for a top line growth rate of 2% to 4%."",
  ""The two AI projects already executed, one in Q4 and one in the first half of this year, largely offset each other in the year-on-year comparisons."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $385 million to $410 million, for a growth of 4% to 11%."",
  ""This reflects a margin target of 23% to 24%."",
  ""As a reminder, we expect to realize $60 million of cost savings in-year, but are reinvesting half of that, or $30 million."",
  ""On top of this, we're reinvesting the $15 million of proceeds from our Q1 AI deal for total in-year reinvestment of $45 million."",
  ""As Matt noted, we come out of a multi-year period of underinvestment in the core, so we are moving decisively on growth opportunities and strengthening our position in the market."",
  ""As a reminder, margin expansion is a multi-year objective for us, with our goal of 23% to 24% this year rising to 24% to 25% in fiscal 2026, and working to continuously expand beyond that."",
  ""Adjusted EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.25 to $3.60 for a growth of 17% to 29%."",
  ""The primary drivers are higher expected adjusted operating income and accrued interest income from divestitures offsetting higher interest and tax expense."",
  ""Free cash flow is anticipated to be approximately $125 million, up from $114 million."",
  ""This is due to improved working capital and lower restructuring payments offsetting higher incentive compensation payments compared to the prior-year period."",
  ""Note that annual cash incentive payouts are made in Q1 for prior year performance, and that over 90% of our colleagues are in the annual incentive plan."",
  ""We will have more full year visibility when we report our Q3 results in March."",
  ""Let's turn to our financial position."",
  ""Free cash flow for the half was a use of $130 million, slightly ahead of prior year."",
  ""Always a reminder, free cash flow is historically a use of cash in the first half due to the timing of annual journal subscription receipts, which are concentrated in Q3 and Q4."",
  ""Lower CapEx year-to-date was due to timing."",
  ""Also, we have some foregone cash earnings from divested assets."",
  ""As a reminder, we don't adjust that out in cash flow."",
  ""Year-to-date, we allocated $64 million towards dividends and share repurchases, up from $61 million in the prior year."",
  ""Approximately $25 million was used to acquire 557,000 shares at an average cost per share of $44.89."",
  ""In June 2024, Wiley raised its dividend for the 31st consecutive year."",
  ""Not many small cap companies can say that."",
  ""Finally, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.2 at the end of October, compared to 2.0 in the prior-year period."",
  ""And with that, I'll pass it over to Matt.""

  "" for taking the questions and color."",
  ""You covered a lot of ground, so I may have a few questions this morning as well, if it's okay."",
  ""Maybe start with the momentum that you're seeing in the Learning business."",
  ""You talked about some of the drivers, but maybe elaborate a little bit as well as your confidence in the sustainability of that growth going forward."",
  ""And then switching to Research."",
  ""Maybe just talk a little bit more about trends that you're seeing in article submissions, as well as your expectations for growth overall."",
  ""And then, secondarily, may be limited in what you can say at this point, but the new agreement in India is certainly interesting."",
  ""When might you have more to say about the growth potential as well as any margin impact that you see from that type of opportunity?"",
  ""No, that's probably intuitive, but a great reminder."",
  ""Maybe just – you touched on additional cost rationalization, my word, not yours, but cost reduction or management opportunities."",
  ""Where do you see the most opportunity?"",
  ""And do you expect to be in a position to quantify kind of a second leg of targeted cost reduction initiatives, or you expect additional savings to be more kind of incremental and ongoing?"",
  ""Any update on potential collections from sale of divested businesses?"",
  ""From a capital allocation perspective, obviously, cash flow much heavier in the back half of the year, as is typical."",
  ""But you continue to return cash to shareholders, including $25 million for buybacks."",
  ""Just talk about priorities going forward."",
  ""As that cash comes in, would you be content to further reduce leverage?"",
  ""You do have internal investments, but – or would you continue to be aggressive in terms of returning cash to shareholders, or are there other areas of investment I should be thinking about?"",
  ""We've made a ton of progress."",
  ""The portfolio has been reshaped."",
  ""You're getting further down the path in terms of your restructuring activities, pivoting to growth."",
  ""Any plans for more aggressive investor relations outreach?"",
  ""It's been a while since we did an analyst Investor Day."",
  ""Obviously tons changed since then."",
  ""So just wondering what your thinking is on that front as we head into maybe fiscal 2026."",
  "" again for all the color."",
  ""And Chris look forward to working with you."",
  "" again for all the color."",
  ""We also have Jay with us."",
  ""So I'm going to ask Jay to comment on that."",
  ""Dan, there's also an important nuance to the volume, which is that even though the Western markets have lower growth rates, because of the maturity of science in the Western markets, those articles have higher approval rates."",
  ""So it's both, it's mix plus how many articles do we accept."",
  ""As we have talked about in the past, there's some complex dynamics around the article pipeline."",
  ""Couple of perspectives, and then I'll ask Chris to comment."",
  ""We see opportunities across the board, particularly an area of focus for us is technology as we modernize our infrastructure."",
  ""We have some substantial investment going on in infrastructure modernization and we are looking forward to seeing the benefits of that."",
  ""It's obviously – probably in a year or two when those projects are completed."",
  ""But I think the more important message is margin improvement is now a way of life here, and we don't view it as separate projects, but really a continuous effort to improve margins year-on-year."",
  ""And the good news is that we all get it."",
  ""It's a shared goal among the team and we're excited about it."",
  ""So, we will give more visibility into what the next few years look like later this year as we see how our landing point and how this year plays out."",
  ""But we're excited about the opportunity to continue to drive margin improvement as we reinvest in growth in the core business."",
  ""Chris, anything you want to add to that?"",
  ""Yeah, I've been – I agree with you."",
  ""We have a different leadership team in place."",
  ""So, we're evaluating when is the best time to do this."",
  ""It'll be sometime in the next calendar year."",
  ""But we do want to do an Investor Day, because we have, really, a lot of good things going on that we want to share."",
  ""So, the question is when is the best time to do that?"",
  ""But I would expect one in the new calendar year."",
  ""Well,  for joining us on this journey."",
  ""Wishing you and your families a happy and healthy holiday season, and we look forward to sharing more in our Q3 earnings in March."",
  ""How are you doing, Dan."",
  ""Nice to talk to you again this morning."",
  ""And  for the continued interest and coverage."",
  ""We feel optimistic that we're on track to achieve our guidance, driven in part by performance in Learning."",
  ""I want to focus for a second on the margin side."",
  ""The team's done a great job over the last 18 months to adjust our cost structure and continue to drive top line performance at the same time."",
  ""And that has been a really strong effort by the part of the leadership there."",
  ""We are seeing continued growth in our zyBooks platform in computer science, data science, AI."",
  ""That is a core driver of performance Learning, as well as a bit of recovery in our trade business, which, as Chris noted in his prepared remarks, had been an underinvested area for us."",
  ""We also feel very good about the progress that the team is making in new content acquisition, in particular in signings, which are a good forward-looking indicator for us."",
  ""So, all that taken together with some added tailwinds from AI revenue, which is always nice to see in that business, we feel like we're on a good footing in Learning."",
  ""We've stabilized that business and the return to growth is exactly what we predicted when we started on this journey."",
  ""Let me start with India just for a second and then we'll kind of work backwards."",
  ""We have been working with the Indian government for multiple years to evaluate the potential for a One Nation One Subscription agreement, and we're very pleased."",
  ""First of all, we want to congratulate the Indian government for getting this deal over the line."",
  ""It's been a priority for the Modi government for a number of years to get this done."",
  ""So, we think this is going to have a huge impact for Indian research."",
  ""This expands coverage of access to journal and database content to a tremendous number of Indian institutions."",
  ""And we're going to see – it is a little early to talk about impact, but we're going to see commensurate growth in our subscription revenue base."",
  ""We've also, through this process, really developed close partnerships with some of the key Indian institutions, and India's the sixth largest market in the world for articles."",
  ""So, those partnerships give us an opportunity to think about new ways to adjust our publishing approach in India."",
  ""We feel like there's great potential in the market in core areas that we all know about, like engineering."",
  ""But also increasingly as the government expands its priorities into core primary research in physics and life sciences and biosciences, it's a market with a lot of potential and we're glad to be in on the ground floor with the One Nation One Subscription agreement."",
  ""In terms of overall what we're seeing in article submissions, the pattern holds the same."",
  ""The markets in Asia are growing faster than markets in the West."",
  ""But what I'd like to point out is that the markets in the West have recovered."",
  ""So, in fact, we've seen a return to growth in the kind of mid-single digits in most of the Western markets and continued tailwinds from places like India, China, excitingly also Japan."",
  ""So we're feeling really good about continued demand for our services."",
  ""As we always like to point out, a lot of these articles go to underpin the value of our subscription business."",
  ""So it's not going to pop as incremental revenue, but it underlies that core engine for Wiley and continues to bolster that."",
  ""And then, as Chris said in his prepared remarks, we did see nice growth in the prior Q from our author paid revenue streams and, in particular, author paid open access in the journals business and we expect that to continue throughout the year."",
  ""No, I don't necessarily have a lot more to add to that, Matt."",
  ""I would say, shared services in general is an area where we see the opportunities and it's just a bit premature to put specific numbers on anything at this point."",
  ""At this point, we anticipate getting the funds that are owed us."",
  ""We do not have timing necessarily on the largest outstanding balance, which was related to our University Services business."",
  ""We continue to watch that business closely and it's performing, and we anticipate that we will see some funds in the future, but not on a date or a schedule that we can articulate at this point."",
  ""The due date on that note is substantially in the future, but we would hope that they will be able to secure some rounds of funding before that due date."",
  ""We've had traditionally a very balanced approach, and we would look to continue that as that cash came in."",
  ""We are always evaluating opportunities to deploy it for future growth and have solid returns to shareholders."",
  ""Wouldn't look for anything unique to come out of that."",
  ""It most likely be initially used to pay down debt, but be able to secure our ability to make investments into the future.""

  ""And, fourth, given our strong execution, key contract awards, robust pipeline and 95% visibility to the midpoint of our guidance range, we reaffirm revenue, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS guidance for fiscal year 2025."",
  ""Our strong second quarter results, coupled with other key achievements in the quarter, clearly positions us to continue creating value for all our key stakeholders."",
  ""For example, we were awarded two large sole source Switchblade IDIQ awards, representing a record $1.7 billion in contract ceiling."",
  ""While the funded amounts under these awards were expected for this fiscal year, the long-term visibility and demand for Switchblade has improved even further."",
  ""In addition, we launched our latest market leading UnCrewed Systems solution, the P550."",
  ""This new Group 2 UAS further strengthens our portfolio and fills the gap between our Puma and JUMP 20 ISR platforms."",
  ""The P550 offers unmatched payload capacity, endurance, flexibility and adaptability for our customers' most demanding missions."",
  ""This solution is performing well in the U.S. Army's Long Range Reconnaissance competition, which is valued at approximately $1 billion over the next decade."",
  ""We're also receiving multiple additional domestic and international interest for this industry-leading solution."",
  ""We believe the P550 will become another global franchise product similar to our Raven and Puma solutions."",
  ""With an expanding pipeline of opportunities and growing backlog, we continue to focus on increasing our production capacity and throughput to meet our customers' needs."",
  ""We remain on track to achieve the production goals we shared last quarter."",
  ""And, last but not least, we took a major step towards achieving our future state when we announced our agreement to acquire BlueHalo, a defense technology leader operating in several key franchises in space, counter-UAS, cyber and electronic warfare."",
  ""This acquisition will enable us to become an even stronger and more diversified defense technology provider, delivering highly innovative mission-critical solutions with enhanced speed and agility."",
  ""We believe our combined portfolio will provide us with industry-leading positions in space communication, unmanned aerial systems, counter-UAS, Loitering Munitions, electronic warfare and cybersecurity, all enabled by the best in class autonomy and AI software suite."",
  ""On a pro forma basis, the combined company is expected to deliver approximately $1.7 billion in annual revenue."",
  ""We continue to work diligently towards completing this transaction and expect it to close in the first half of calendar year 2025, subject to regulatory and AV shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions."",
  ""We're confident that as a combined business, we will leverage our strengths and deliver even better outcomes for our customers, employees and shareholders."",
  ""With that, I'd like to now discuss results from each of our three business segments, starting with Loitering Munitions Systems or LMS."",
  ""As we stated previously, LMS was once again, our strongest revenue growth driver for the quarter, as expected."",
  ""Revenue increased by more than 2 times from the same period last fiscal year."",
  ""Revenues totaled about $78 million, a new second quarter LMS record."",
  ""Our Switchblade products are performing very well in the field and has become the global standard for Loitering Munitions globally."",
  ""Our customers value Switchblade's unmatched ability to operate in heavily contested environments, with very high success rates."",
  ""Switchblades 300 and Switchblades 600 continue to strike very high value targets in a cost-effective manner, presenting an incredible value proposition for our customers."",
  ""Additionally, demand for both Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 continues to grow, as evidenced by our most recent multiple U.S. DoD IDIQ awards."",
  ""These contracts enable our customers to procure greater quantities of our products more quickly."",
  ""The U.S. Army announced a five-year sole source IDIQ award, with a ceiling value of nearly $1 billion, and we've already received an initial $128 million task order under this contract for the U.S. Army's Directed Requirement for Lethal Unmanned Systems."",
  ""We also received a separate sole source modification to an existing contract from the U.S. Army, which increased the contract ceiling for Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 by nearly $750 million."",
  ""Under this U.S. Army IDIQ, we have received a task order valued at roughly $55 million of Switchblade 600 and Switchblade 300."",
  ""Both IDIQ awards contain beneficial new terms that allow for progress payments, which will significantly improve our cash flow and working capital usage."",
  ""These orders should also facilitate a faster procurement process for key additional domestic and international opportunities."",
  ""In addition to increasing domestic demand and orders, our Switchblade product line continues to see more international demand."",
  ""As part of the $55 million award I just mentioned, we received FMS orders from three additional allies: Lithuania, Romania and Sweden."",
  ""Moreover, Taiwan and Greece have also publicly announced their intention to purchase significant quantities of Switchblades in the near future."",
  ""Looking ahead, we have even more countries in our pipeline planning to add Switchblades to their other AV offerings to create a comprehensive family of system solution set."",
  ""Additionally, we're pleased to share that we delivered our first tranche of Switchblades to the In support of all this growing demand, we remain focused on further scaling manufacturing to support more than $500 million in annual Switchblade product revenue by the end of this fiscal year."",
  ""We have also selected an additional new location, where we will expand our Loitering Munitions manufacturing beyond fiscal year 2025."",
  ""In the meantime, AV's track record of delivering Switchblades and high quality, high reliability and high volume remains unmatched in the industry."",
  ""Finally, we continue to invest in new Switchblade variants and upgrades to current product."",
  ""We hope to announce further details on these new offerings at a future date."",
  ""In summary, we're very confident about the growth trajectory of our LMS business, and we anticipate continued momentum that goes well beyond fiscal year 2025."",
  ""Now, onto our UnCrewed Systems segment."",
  ""Revenue for the second quarter was nearly $86 million, reflecting another quarter of solid performance."",
  ""Our UnCrewed Systems segment remains a strong revenue and profitability driver for the company, largely due to our Puma and JUMP 20 platforms."",
  ""That said, we strengthened our portfolio with the P550, our latest UnCrewed Systems product, which we showcased at the annual AUSA Conference in Washington, D.C. in early October."",
  ""Consistent with our track record, we expect this solution to be the gold standard for Group 2 UAS and create another global franchise in UnCrewed solutions for the company."",
  ""The P550 is part of our recently submitted proposal for the U.S. Army's Long Range Reconnaissance program or LRR, and we hope to receive an update on our submission in the coming months."",
  ""We also anticipate strong global demand for this product beyond the U.S. Army's program of record, with additional interest coming from the The P550 demonstrates our continued commitment to provide innovative, intelligent, autonomous platforms that ensure operational superiority for our customers, and we expect this platform to be a significant contributor to this segment's future growth."",
  ""In addition, we're seeing continued momentum in our JUMP 20 system."",
  ""We now have a sales pipeline of more than $0.5 billion and hope to share additional details on at least two expected wins soon."",
  ""Additionally, we remain engaged with the U.S. Army's FTUAS program office to potentially compete for upcoming tranches."",
  ""Given favorable feedback on our Puma, JUMP 20 and now the P550 platforms, we anticipate domestic and international demand for our UxS solutions to remain healthy in 2025 and beyond."",
  ""Moving now to our MacCready Works segment."",
  ""MacCready Works continues to make solid progress on its key opportunities, with the goal to provide solutions and capabilities that meet our customers' evolving needs, especially through the development of novel platforms and autonomous capabilities."",
  ""As an example, this past quarter, we continued our flight test program with the defense variant of our HAPS Sunglider, which demonstrated the ability to fly at high altitudes, while providing persistent and reliable surveillance."",
  ""As part of this flight test program, we flew a state-of-the-art Synthetic Aperture Radar or SAR payload, and demonstrated advanced surveillance capabilities."",
  ""Additionally, our efforts with the U.S. DoD are continuing to progress, and we were recently awarded another $7 million follow-on contract to continue the HAPS Defense Flight Test program."",
  ""We remain convinced that our HAPS platform is another unique and game-changing capability for our customers' current and future missions."",
  ""MacCready Works continues to play a significant role in the overall development of AV's new and innovative solution offerings."",
  ""We look forward to sharing more exciting announcements from this business segment in future quarters."",
  ""In summary, our strong execution, key contract awards and robust pipeline gives us confidence in the remainder of fiscal year 2025 and beyond."",
  ""Our solid performance today, a healthy backlog and recent orders have increased our visibility to 95% of the midpoint of our revenue guidance range, but we still see some risks with order timing, especially given the continuing resolution environment and change in administrations."",
  ""Therefore, we are reaffirming our fiscal year 2025 revenue, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS guidance and now expect third quarter revenue to represent about 40% of second half revenues."",
  ""With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Kevin McDonnell for a review of our second quarter financials."",
  ""Our second quarter performance validates the increasing importance of our products and solutions to our customers."",
  ""Global demand for autonomous, AI-enabled uncrewed solutions continues to rise, and we're well-positioned to deliver innovative products in volume and quality to support our customers' evolving needs."",
  ""We believe we're well-positioned to benefit from the U.S. DoD's budget priorities and look forward to working with the new administration."",
  ""We're also encouraged by the increase in international demand, especially for our Switchblade and JUMP 20 solutions."",
  ""Finally, we believe the addition of BlueHalo will position us as the best-in-class next-generation defense technology leader, focused on our global customers' most critical mission objectives and priorities."",
  ""We also just concluded our Technical Interchange Meeting or TIM, where we hosted participants from 24 countries."",
  ""The primary objective of our TIM event is to educate our customers on our market-leading solutions and hear their feedback and needs."",
  ""There's a fundamental shift occurring in war strategy, requiring significantly more UAS and Loitering Munitions."",
  ""We now see a new wave of procurements across the globe."",
  ""Customers want sustainable partners with the experience, track record and resources to deliver innovative and cost-effective solutions with agility."",
  ""These factors, coupled with our strong performance of our systems in combat, especially in Ukraine, position us to capture our fair share of this expanding opportunity."",
  ""Before turning the call over for questions, let me again summarize the key takeaways from today's call."",
  ""First, second quarter fiscal year 2025 revenue grew to $188 million, setting a new second quarter record."",
  ""Second, our Loitering Munitions Systems segment continues to be the key growth driver for the company."",
  ""Third, funded backlog is a healthy $467 million, and fourth, we reaffirm our revenue, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP EPS guidance for fiscal year 2025 and anticipate we will set new records for the company this fiscal year."",
  ""Before we take questions, I would like to thank our customers for their continued faith that our company and products can meet their high standards and support their critical missions."",
  ""I would also like to thank our incredibly talented team, here at AV, for their dedication and hard work in enabling the growth and adoption we are now seeing."",
  ""And, finally, I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued interest and support of our growth strategy."",
  ""It is truly an honor to support our country and allies at this important time."",
  ""And, with that, Kevin, Jonah and I will now take your questions."",
  ""Welcome to AeroVironment's fiscal year 2025 second quarter ."",
  ""This is Jonah Teeter-Balin, Vice President of Corporate Development and Investor Relations."",
  ""Before we begin, please note that certain information presented on this call contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""These statements involve many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations."",
  ""Further information on these risks and uncertainties is contained in the company's 10-K and other filings with the SEC, in particular in the risk factors and forward-looking statement portions of such filings."",
  ""Copies are available from the SEC on the AeroVironment website at www.avinc.com or from our Investor Relations team."",
  ""This afternoon, we also filed a slide presentation with our  and posted the presentation to the Investors section of our website under Events & Presentations."",
  ""The content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of today, December 4, 2024."",
  ""The company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise."",
  ""Joining me from AeroVironment are Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, Wahid Nawabi; Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Kevin McDonnell."",
  ""We will now begin with remarks from Wahid Nawabi."",
  ""Today, I'll be reviewing the highlights of our second quarter performance, during which I will occasionally refer to both our press release and earnings presentation available on our website."",
  ""In summary, we posted another strong revenue and adjusted EBITDA quarter."",
  ""We also saw our funded backlog grow after several quarters of decline and our outlook remains for another strong fiscal year."",
  ""Given the pending BlueHalo acquisition, any references to future performance, exclude the impact of BlueHalo, which is expected to close during the first half of calendar 2025."",
  ""As Wahid mentioned in his remarks, revenue for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 was $188.5 million, an increase of 4%, as compared to the $180.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""Slide 6 of the earnings presentation provides a breakdown of revenue by segment for the quarter."",
  ""Our largest segment for the quarter was UnCrewed Systems or UxS, which is the combination of small UAS, medium UAS and the UGV businesses."",
  ""UxS had revenue of $85.4 million in the quarter, which is down 36% from last year's total of $132.8 million, primarily driven by a decrease in Ukraine revenue of $54 million."",
  ""Puma demand remained strong, accounting for 71% of UxS revenue, but we also saw meaningful contributions from our UGV products, JUMP 20 and Tomahawk, during the quarter."",
  ""Our Loitering Munitions Systems segment or LMS, recorded revenue of $77.7 million, a 157% increase as compared to the $30.2 million during last year's second quarter."",
  ""The LMS undefinitized contract actions or UCAs, were definitized in Q2, which resulted in approximately $10 million increase to Q2 revenue and gross margin."",
  ""Revenue from our MacCready Works segment came in at $25.3 million, an increase of 42% as compared to $17.8 million for the second quarter of last fiscal year, primarily driven by HAPS revenue from both SoftBank and the U.S. Department of Defense for stratospheric flight testing."",
  ""In slide 6 of our earnings presentation, there's also a breakdown between product and service revenue."",
  ""Specifically, during the second quarter, product revenue accounted for 80% of total revenues, which is in line with the corresponding quarter of the previous year, primarily due to the strong product revenue from both our small UAS, LMS and medium UAS products."",
  ""We expect product revenues as a percentage of revenue to remain above 80% for the foreseeable future."",
  ""Moving to gross margins, slide 7 of the earnings presentation shows the trend of adjusted product and service gross margins, while slide 12 reconciles the GAAP gross margins to adjusted gross margins, which excludes intangible amortization expense."",
  ""In the second quarter, consolidated GAAP gross margins finished at 39%, which is lower than the second quarter last year due to the higher margin UxS mix in the prior period."",
  ""Now, turning to adjusted gross margins, second quarter adjusted gross margins were 41%, which is lower than the 43% for the same period last year, due to the change in sales mix, as described previously."",
  ""We expect adjusted gross margins for the second half of the year to be 38% to 40% and ending the full year between 40% and 41%."",
  ""We should exit the fourth quarter at the higher end of the second half range."",
  ""Adjusted product gross margins for the second – for the quarter were 44% versus 47% in the second quarter of last fiscal year."",
  ""Again, we had a strong UxS revenue in the second quarter of last year, driven by Ukraine sales, which contributed to higher adjusted product margins."",
  ""We do expect adjusted gross product margins to decline in the coming quarters as we continue to expect the contribution of product revenues from LMS to increase."",
  ""In terms of adjusted service gross margins, the second quarter was at 28%, in line with the same quarter of last year."",
  ""In terms of adjusted EBITDA, slide 13 shows the reconciliation of GAAP net income to adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 was $25.9 million, down from last year's Q2 of $39.5 million."",
  ""Just a reminder that our last year's first half was very strong because of Ukraine revenue."",
  ""Year-over-year, revenue was up slightly, but SG&A and R&D expense are running higher, resulting in a lower first half adjusted EBITDA versus last year."",
  ""However, these higher SG&A and R&D expenses are in line with guidance for the year and I'll go into more detail shortly."",
  ""We expect adjusted EBITDA for Q3 to be slightly down from Q2, but Q4 is significantly higher than any of the first three quarters."",
  ""Also note that we incurred $3.7 million acquisition-related expenses in Q2."",
  ""We'll continue to incur these expenses related to the BlueHalo transaction for the remainder of the fiscal year and likely into next fiscal year."",
  ""Because of the difficulty of predicting the timing and amount of transaction expenses, which impact GAAP net income, we're only providing revenue, non-GAAP EPS and adjusted EBITDA guidance."",
  ""SG&A expense, excluding intangible amortization and acquisition-related expenses, for the second quarter was $33 million or 18% of revenue, compared to $26 million or 14% of revenue in the prior year."",
  ""The increase in SG&A expense is partially the result of an increase in sales and marketing expense, primarily driven by an increase in bid and proposal activity, along with employee-related costs due to increase in average head count to help support our expected growth and expansion of our operations."",
  ""We expect SG&A, as a percentage of revenue, before intangibles and acquisition-related expenses to decline in the next two quarters as we end the year in the 15% to 16% range."",
  ""R&D expense for the second quarter was $29 million or 15% of revenue, compared to $22 million or 12% of revenue in the prior year."",
  ""The R&D spend in the quarter was driven by several key development projects, specifically our Group 2 UAS; the P550, introduced at AUSA; the meritization of the JUMP 20 and the integration of the Tomahawk controller into several of our UxS products."",
  ""In addition, we continue development of several Switchblade variants."",
  ""Our R&D investment reached a high point in dollars and percentage for the year in Q2, and we expect sequential decreases in dollars and percentage in Q3 and Q4."",
  ""We expect R&D to be in the range of 12% to 13% of revenue for fiscal year 2025."",
  ""Now, turning to GAAP earnings."",
  ""In the second quarter, the company generated net income of $7.5 million versus net income of $17.8 million, reported in the same period last year."",
  ""The decrease in net income of $10.3 million can be attributed to several factors, namely a $9.8 million increase in SG&A expenses, including a Slide 11 shows the reconciliation of GAAP and adjusted or non-GAAP diluted EPS."",
  ""The company posted adjusted earnings per share – diluted share of $0.47 for the second quarter of fiscal 2025 versus $0.97 per diluted share for the second quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""Turning to the balance sheet, at the close of the second quarter, our total cash and investments amounted to $91.2 million, compared to $103 million at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""Unbilled receivables declined $15 million during the second quarter from the first quarter, but continue to be elevated largely attributable to our LMS business segment."",
  ""Although our new payment terms on LMS contracts didn't have any impact on the second quarter, we expect these new terms to start favorably impacting our unbilled receivables beginning in the third quarter."",
  ""We, therefore, anticipate an improvement in working capital for the remainder of the fiscal year."",
  ""We also completed a $200 million revolving credit facility with four banks during the quarter, which included paying down the remaining term loan balance and funding $15 million on that revolver."",
  ""I'd like to conclude with some highlights of our backlog metrics."",
  ""Our funded backlog at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2025 finished at $467.1 million, an increase of $94.2 million or 25%, compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2025, driven by our recent LMS domestic and Foreign Military Sales award."",
  ""In addition, we currently have $1.8 billion of unfunded backlog."",
  ""Now, I'd like to turn things back to Wahid.""
]","[
  ""Hey, Wahid, can we dig in a little bit on the UnCrewed kind of category?"",
  ""This is, I think, the lowest revenue quarter that you've had in that, in the last I think like eight quarters."",
  ""So maybe just to – can you kind of describe what you're seeing from the demand environment there?"",
  ""And because I guess, we're not really expecting any revenues from P550 maybe this fiscal year, but it seems like it's going be a great product from what we saw at AUSA."",
  ""Just what can you describe about what you're seeing and how you think you're positioned in that category?"",
  ""I appreciate the color there."",
  ""And just as for my follow-up, could talk a little bit about where you stand on, I guess Replicator deliveries and if you've started to ship to Taiwan and any comments that you can make on the protest that was put against the IDIQ contract?"",
  ""I'll jump back in the queue."",
  ""Have you been making progress in terms of adding the Switchblade to the Kinesis Ecosystem?"",
  ""You've discussed the – a very robust growth for the Switchblade portfolio as it relates to Replicator and less so – and for foreign military sales, and we're just wondering on how you're making investments on the software front for Switchblade?"",
  ""And along those lines, in terms of integrating Kinesis with third-party products."",
  ""Do you feel that Kinesis will be able to provide a common operating system for the many different BlueHalo product lines as well and tie those together with the Switchblade and the Puma and JUMP 20 product lines?"",
  ""And, one final one, you discussed pressure from Ukraine for the UnCrewed Systems segment, and we were wondering, how did Ukraine impact the Loitering Munitions segment?"",
  ""And, just in general, what are the overall expectations for Ukraine funding and contributions to your business for this year and for future years given all the discussions of a potential ceasefire there?"",
  ""Maybe just to start on international Switchblade, I think you called out three additional allies as part of that $55 million task order and also called out Taiwan and Greece."",
  ""Can you maybe just remind us where you stand?"",
  ""I think in the past you've talked about, 20 potential customers just in terms of converting the rest of the international pipeline."",
  ""And then, also with the awards that you did get, how do you think about those kind of building over time?"",
  ""I'm assuming those were just initial quantities?"",
  ""And then, maybe just to clarify one remark you made in the prepared ones, I mean, you talked about risk due to a change in administration, 40% of H2 revenues in Q3, but said you had 95% visibility for the year."",
  ""I mean, how do you think about that risk materializing?"",
  ""And is that captured in the current guidance?"",
  ""How much of that's in the order front and how does that materialize?"",
  ""So – hey, Wahid, I wanted to ask about a couple of Army programs that I don't think you were involved in, and just maybe you can give us some context."",
  ""The first was this Army Short Range Reconnaissance program."",
  ""I think it's a program of record that, I believe, Red Cat won, but you guys didn't really talk about it, as far as I can recall."",
  ""So, it leads me to believe that maybe you didn't compete for it at all."",
  ""Maybe you could validate that and give us a sense of why you chose not to invest or compete there?"",
  ""And then, I have a follow-up."",
  ""I appreciate all that color."",
  ""And then, just one follow-up."",
  ""The other thing I – we've seen over the last few months or so is the Army making an award I think to two companies for – I believe it was for company-level UAVs."",
  "" so much for the color."",
  ""Wahid, Kevin,  for the question."",
  ""I know previously you guys have called out that Ukraine was roughly about 40% of sales at some points."",
  ""Could you maybe call out roughly how much of it attributed to this past quarter sales?"",
  ""And on your final remarks on the number of countries you announced."",
  ""I asked about this last quarter, you previously had said something around half a dozen plus different countries in which you're actively engaging with and kind of in the red zone with so to speak."",
  ""Where does this number stand out now?"",
  ""Have there been additions with some of those that we've seen finalization with?"",
  ""How should we think about how many we have in the red zone right now?"",
  ""I'll jump back in the queue."",
  ""Absolutely, it's my belief that our UxS segment has been and will continue to be one of the strongest revenue and profitability driver for our business as a whole."",
  ""We believe that the UxS or UnCrewed Systems segment has a tremendous long-term growth and value proposition opportunities in several key areas."",
  ""The reason for the revenue and the UxS not being as high as historical levels is because we've transitioned away from the Ukraine big, big demand that happened last year."",
  ""We were expecting that, we have been working successfully to diversify from that and we are successfully delivering on that strategy."",
  ""Secondly, I would say that there is a tremendous amount of demand for both our existing Puma systems, both Puma AE and Puma LE, as well as our JUMP 20 system."",
  ""For example, we have over $0.5 billion worth of real solid pipeline of opportunities for our JUMP 20 systems, and most of that is both domestic and international."",
  ""So it's a very good mix of customers in multiple geographies."",
  ""And third, we believe that the next wave of demand for our UxS systems, especially the non-lethal one, is going to be fueled dramatically over the next two years to three years with our P550 introduction and a few other products that we have in the development pipeline."",
  ""So, we believe that the position that we have right now with the LRR competition program record, which is another $1 billion program, is going to fuel another wave of growth and establish a new, sort of what I call a franchise product similar to our Ravens, similar to our Pumas and the Group 2 UAS category."",
  ""So, overall, I'm very confident about that business, its ability to be able to continue to grow."",
  ""It's going to be lumpy and variable on a quarterly – quarter-by-quarter basis."",
  ""That's because of the nature of the business."",
  ""And the long-term, though looks quite strong, and we are looking for lots and lots of opportunities for growth."",
  ""So, related to Replicator, we're pleased to report that we are an incredibly successful company and being able to deliver on the promises and expectations of the U.S. Military and the Pentagon has had on that program."",
  ""What I referred to as a poster child of that entire initiative."",
  ""We have already shipped a significant portion of product, specifically the Switchblade 600s to that customer, and we'll continue to ship more as we go forward."",
  ""So, in general, the Replicator program has been a quite good, good success for us, and there is more to come on that program as part of our backlog and as well as the future order that we expect for the growing business of Switchblade in general."",
  ""Secondly, and related to the protest, we are still under – waiting for the decision of the Department of Justice."",
  ""They have until mid-December, until late December to decide."",
  ""And, although during that time, the government, the U.S. Army has given us authorization to proceed to be able to ship products, so we can meet our customers' needs."",
  ""We believe that our position is strong."",
  ""I think we have a very compliant, competent bid and award, and we can – we expect to continue delivering product under the Replicator, as well as the IDIQ for our customer."",
  ""So, it has been our plan from the beginning to continue to integrate the Kinesis, the common ground control station in the software ecosystem with the rest of our portfolio."",
  ""It is a major driver of value to our customers' missions to simplify the operating process for them and actually achieve the stated outcomes they've got."",
  ""The priority list of which product to integrate first is primarily driven by our customers' priority."",
  ""Our customers today really need to deliver product, the Switchblades with the existing controllers because there's a training process that has to happen with the customer in the field, with all the products that we've got to deploy."",
  ""We are making progress and we have plans to eventually integrate it with Switchblade as well."",
  ""We're in the testing and integration phase, and soon, we will be able to announce that we are successfully now shipping that product, but we're not at that point yet, and that's primarily driven by prioritizing this activity with our customers' requirements and their ranked order of what they want to see first."",
  ""But overall, we're very pleased with the Tomahawk controller and their business and their team."",
  ""They continue to grow and make really significant wins, and we're going to continue to integrate their controllers, not only with our product portfolio, but many other third-party products that are out there."",
  ""So, we're very pleased with the progress we're making on that so far."",
  ""So, Louie, absolutely, it's our – it's part of our plans to eventually provide our customer with a holistic common operating picture of our entire portfolio of solution set, including any other third-party platforms and assets that are potentially in the theater or in the battlefield, and that is the objective that we've had from day one, and we're going to continue to do that."",
  ""We're very, very excited about the possibilities of integrating our solutions with BlueHalo, although I'm not in a position to be able to comment on that because we're obviously through the regulatory approval process, and we must wait and follow the rules on the regulatory approvals that have to come from the Department of – from the government and various departments, SEC, and also our shareholder approval."",
  ""However, in general, I could say that it's fundamental to our strategy to be able to provide this successfully for our customers because that is what the customer needs and has – is expecting from players like us."",
  ""We're fortunate to be in a position that we are, because our solution set is widely used in the government, and they're very happy with the way that we've actually delivered these integration and interoperability with our system so far, and we're going to continue to do that, I believe, in the future."",
  ""So – and so, Louie, it's a great question."",
  ""I'm glad you asked the question because, we feel very, very positive about the prospects of growth for our company regardless of Ukraine, regardless of any specific one conflict in any part of the world."",
  ""The world is not safer than what it was before, and it doesn't look like it's continuing to become any better, safer, A. B, Ukraine has tremendous existing needs for our systems and they continue to ask for more."",
  ""Even if there's a ceasefire, we believe that there's going to be significant amount of buildup of capabilities to avoid another potential secondary or Lastly, I would say our portfolio is incredibly diversified."",
  ""The growth that we see in our Loitering Munitions is not fueled by one source or one particular customer or demand."",
  ""It is global, it is multi-faceted and it's going to continue for the next, I see, at least 5 to 10 years."",
  ""It is – it's essentially become a shift in the defense strategy around the world, where small unmanned systems like our Pumas and Ravens and P550s and others, as well as Loitering Munitions such as Switchblade, are becoming a much, much bigger integral piece of that defense strategy for every one of the allies that we have and for the U.S. DoD. So, I think that's going to be a very strong, healthy growth for us for the years to come besides and beyond Ukraine."",
  ""So, Greg, as I mentioned on the call that, as part of one of the task orders or contract awards of the $55 million as part of those IDIQs that we have, under the IDIQ ceilings contracts, there was initial orders for Lithuania, Romania and Sweden."",
  ""On top of that, Taiwan and Greece has also publicly announced their intention to purchase significant quantities of Switchblade."",
  ""And so, that is, again, these are the initial orders that we're going to be – we have just received."",
  ""And, as I said on the remarks, the list of countries that are planning to acquire and procure Switchblade, both Switchblade 300 and Switchblade 600 is growing every quarter, and we continue to make progress on that."",
  ""And so, we think that the outlook for growth for Switchblades 300 and Switchblades 600 combined, and the other variants, is incredibly bright and positive, not only for this year, but well beyond this year, for the next several years."",
  ""For that same reason, we are continuing to invest in increasing our production capacity."",
  ""So, by the end of this fiscal year, as I stated on those previous calls, we intend to be at about a $0.5 billion worth of production run rate capacity and in volume."",
  ""And we already are in planning on actually bringing up another site to continue to grow that business beyond this fiscal year and fiscal 2026."",
  ""And so, our plans, our expectations and our progress has been solid."",
  ""I believe that it would not surprise me over the next three years to four years that we have a very large international – a set of countries that are at place or going to continue to place orders with Switchblade, and that's going to be a fantastic franchise for us long-term."",
  ""And so, lastly, I would say, we continue to invest in new variants of Switchblade, Greg, that allows us to continue to expand the portfolio."",
  ""I mean, this is a new category for the entire defense industry, and we're the, by far, the leading player and provider there."",
  ""And we've got a massive, massive head-start compared to everyone else."",
  ""And our track record of performance is great."",
  ""All of that bodes to a very, very good outcome, in my view, in terms of growth of that business."",
  ""So, we have executed our first half plans, Greg, incredibly well."",
  ""I'm very proud of what our teams have been able to achieve so far."",
  ""We're on track with our plans and we're setting new records, quarterly records, and we're going to be setting a new record with our existing – with the current guidance."",
  ""With 95% visibility at the midpoint of our revenue guidance, we're looking really strong historically compared to what we're providing."",
  ""That's why we reaffirmed our guidance on the top line and the non-GAAP So, with all that we reconfirm guidance, but it's going to be another record year, growth year, with strong profits and top line growth and will set us up with a very healthy backlog for – beyond fiscal 2025."",
  ""Our goal here is consistent with the past, which is to continue to deliver top, top performance in all metrics that we are being measured against and we hold ourselves accountable to."",
  ""We intentionally chose not to compete for that program."",
  ""It is a different set of capability that we strategically decided a while back that that's not a market that we're going to go very strongly on initially."",
  ""There are several factors or the reasons why."",
  ""A, making money in that market and that business is not an easy thing and, if you look at the financials of some of these companies, it's very evident in that regard."",
  ""B, we see that we can deliver a lot more value for our customers and our shareholders, but focusing on much larger and more systemic areas of demand globally that we can deliver a lot more value to all of our customers, as well as shareholders."",
  ""So, we did not compete in that opportunity."",
  ""At the same time, I just want to underline that we continue to monitor those specific capabilities and market niches, and we always have an option to come back in later, if we needed to."",
  ""And the customer also has not had a really good sort of successful outcome so far in terms of executing on that program."",
  ""As you know, that program has been around for a long time, and still, the customer is trying to find the right set of capabilities to execute on that program even further."",
  ""But you're correct, based on my readings publicly and the announcements from customer, that Red Cat Holdings has actually been awarded the next tranche of the SRR program."",
  ""I'm glad you asked that question as well, Pete."",
  ""That is not a threat to the LRR program."",
  ""It is actually very complementary to the LRR."",
  ""We believe that we have a very strong position in the LRR program."",
  ""That program has very good strong support from the customer."",
  ""It has an incredibly strong need from the war fighters perspective and we have a very, very compelling and strong position."",
  ""And, lastly, it represents almost a $1 billion worth of opportunity for AeroVironment or the market in general for the next half a decade to a decade long."",
  ""Now, having said that, the one that you're referring to the company-level ISR, UAV, a small opportunity, the U.S. Army is experimenting with a couple of other platforms to see what the right solution set would be if they were to go into program of record for on MRR, Medium Range Reconnaissance program of record potential opportunity."",
  ""That program However, we're keeping track of that and we intend to compete for the MRR and we believe that we can actually compete very successfully, like we've done in the past in many other programs that we engage in."",
  ""But the main focus today for the U.S. Army and us is the Long Range Reconnaissance program, which we expect to hear something from the customer in the next couple of months."",
  ""And we believe that we are performing really well in that exercise and competition so far."",
  ""So, Andre, historically, I think, in fiscal year 2023, in our 10-K filings, it showed that about 40% of our revenue that year came from Ukraine, and that was the main driver for the surge in demand for our Pumas when Ukraine didn't have any, and U.S. Army and Military decided to give a whole bunch of it to them."",
  ""And it's, since then, they've We have intentionally decided to diversify our revenue mix about a year-and-a-half, two years ago, so we can actually make sure that we still continue to grow, if the Ukraine demand for Pumas went away, as well as for Switchblades."",
  ""We see tremendous amount of new demand for our solutions, and that's why we've been able to actually very successfully achieve that and deliver still top line growth as our business."",
  ""I would argue that, regardless of the Ukraine situation, the demand for small UAS, including Pumas and P550s and Ravens and JUMP 20 and our Loitering Munition is going to continue to actually sustain itself well beyond Ukraine, even if the war were to stop tomorrow."",
  ""We have a tremendous set of drivers for demand and lots of opportunities and a very healthy pipeline in all of those products well beyond Ukraine."",
  ""And as you could see from my remarks earlier, we announced several new countries, there's lots of new platforms, there's a lot of new program of records that are coming up."",
  ""So, we feel very good about our position, both in small UAS, as well as in our Loitering Munitions business."",
  ""So, as you could see, just today, I reiterated two – five countries, Lithuania, Romania, Sweden, those three actually placed initial orders with us."",
  ""We just received their initial orders."",
  ""And then, Taiwan and Greece are asking for – and are now requesting and they have a active case."",
  ""In addition to these countries, we have another half a dozen plus list of countries, which is in different phases of their acquisition process."",
  ""It also requires quite a lot of effort from the US Government and State Department side, besides the customer side, and I believe that within the next several years, the list of countries are going to continue to grow, and the list of customers and installed base for Switchblade are naturally going to continue to grow."",
  ""I foresee, in the next two years to three years, that the Loitering Munitions business is going to have a robust set of international customers, almost equivalent to our domestic business and very similar to our small UAS franchise that we have 55 countries internationally."",
  ""We should have a very large list of countries internationally for Switchblade as well."",
  ""Switchblade is just the gold standard around the globe now with all of our allies in terms of Loitering Munitions."",
  ""And we are thrilled because our strategy to invest in this segment and to deliver that capability has worked, and I think we're going to benefit from that and our customers are going to benefit from that in the next decade or so."",
  "", and , once again, for joining today's conference call and for your interest in AeroVironment."",
  ""As a reminder, an archived version of this call, SEC filings and relevant news can be found under the Investors section of our website."",
  ""We hope you have a good holiday season and look forward to speaking with you again following next quarter's results.""

  ""I'm going to review our fourth quarter and year-end results, and I'll also comment on the current housing environment."",
  ""Brad will follow me with more details, and of course, we'll open it up for Q&A afterwards."",
  ""Let me begin on slide 5."",
  ""Here, we show full-year guidance compared to our actual results."",
  ""Starting on the top of the slide, revenues were $3 billion, which was slightly better than the midpoint of our guidance."",
  ""Our adjusted gross margin was 22% for the year, which was exactly at the midpoint of the guidance we gave."",
  ""Our SG&A ratio was 11.4%, which was very near the midpoint of the guidance that we gave."",
  ""Our income from unconsolidated joint ventures was $52 million, which was slightly below the guidance we gave due to the delayed deliveries in three communities related to utility connections."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA was $456 million for the year, which is above the high end of the range that we gave."",
  ""And finally, our adjusted pre-tax income was $327 million, which was also above the high end of the guidance range that we gave."",
  ""We're obviously pleased that our profitability for the full year was above the high end of the guidance range."",
  ""On slide 6, we show how our full-year results compared to last year."",
  ""Starting in the upper left hand portion of the slide, you can see that our total revenues increased 9% to just over $3 billion."",
  ""Moving across the top to gross margin, our gross margin was 22% in fiscal year 2024, which was slightly below the prior year's gross margin."",
  ""Moving to the bottom left, you can see that adjusted EBITDA increased 7% for the year to $456 million."",
  ""And in the bottom right-hand portion of the slide, we're excited about the adjusted pre-tax income improvement over the prior year, up 16% to $327 million."",
  ""If you go to slide 7, here, we show our results compared to last year's fourth quarter."",
  ""Keep in mind that last year's fourth quarter was one of the strongest fourth quarters that we've had in a very long time, particularly for gross margin and pre-tax income."",
  ""It makes the year-over-year comparisons for the quarter much more difficult."",
  ""Starting in the upper left-hand quadrant of the slide, you can see our total revenues increased 10% to just under $1 billion."",
  ""In the upper right-hand portion of the slide, you can see that our gross margin was a healthy 21.7%, but down compared to a particularly strong margin the previous year."",
  ""On a sequential basis, we decreased slightly from 22.1% in the third quarter of 2024."",
  ""Gross margins declined year-over-year as per our guidance despite a 1% decrease in construction costs over the same period."",
  ""The lower gross margin is primarily due to the continued use of mortgage rate buydowns, which have been stubbornly high due to the elevated levels of mortgage rates as well as some other incentives."",
  ""It's also related to a greater conscious focus on pace versus price, which we will discuss more fully in a moment."",
  ""Going forward, we continue – we expect to continue to use mortgage rate buydowns to help with buyer affordability."",
  ""During this year's fourth quarters, incentives were 8.5% of the average sales price."",
  ""This is up 120 basis points from a year ago and up 500 basis points higher than fiscal 2022, which was prior to the mortgage rate spike impacting deliveries."",
  ""Because of the continued use of incentives and increased land-light position, we expect gross margins to decrease further in the first quarter as we provided in our guidance."",
  ""We continue to emphasize pace over price, and we expect to report strong EBIT ROI again going forward."",
  ""As a side note, we utilize a comparable level of incentives in new land acquisitions and they must meet our IRR minimum hurdle rate of 20% even after the cost of these incentives."",
  ""Moving to the bottom left-hand portion of the slide."",
  ""As a result of the lower gross margin percentage, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA decreased a bit to $159 million in this year's fourth quarter."",
  ""Finally, in the bottom right-hand portion of the slide, correspondingly, adjusted pre-tax profit also decreased a bit to $126 million."",
  ""While the fourth quarter met our expectations and guidance, it would have been better if not for the hurricanes right toward the end of our fiscal year."",
  ""We ended up missing deliveries primarily due to a lack of meters installed in homes and the scarcity of subcontractor crews due to the shift toward rebuilding."",
  ""Our current communities were spared major damage, but there was a tornado that touched down recently in one of our completed communities in Florida's east coast, causing some damage to about a dozen homes."",
  ""I know that new orders and current levels of demand are very much in focus by investor and analysts, so I'm now going to discuss contracts from several different perspectives."",
  ""If you turn to slide 8, while the year was choppy from quarter to quarter, we ended the year with fourth quarter contracts increasing 48% year-over-year."",
  ""Going to repeat that statistic because it's pretty significant."",
  ""Our fourth quarter contract increased 48% year-over-year."",
  ""The contract pace continued in the month of November following the fourth quarter with our contracts up 55% year-over-year as demand for our homes remained robust."",
  ""Regardless of one's politics, there does seem to have been a little post-election enthusiasm regarding the outlook, the economic outlook, at least for our homebuyers."",
  ""If you turn to slide 9, you can see contracts per community for the fourth quarter increased to 10.4, a 25% year-over-year increase and more than double the sales pace of Q4 2022."",
  ""This was a solid fourth quarter sales pace, setting this up for a great fiscal 2025."",
  ""We're pleased with these results, especially given all the uncertainty with the presidential election, the impact of hurricanes, the volatility in mortgage rates, and the general economic and geopolitical uncertainty."",
  ""If you turn to slide 10, we show mortgage rate trends."",
  ""The gray line on this slide shows what happened to mortgage rates last year between July of 2022 and November of 2023."",
  ""The blue line shows what happened with mortgage rates this past year between July of 2023 and November of 2024."",
  ""For most of the time shown, it coincidentally followed a very similar pattern of monthly increases and decreases just at slightly higher rates this year."",
  ""However, beginning in July of this year, mortgage rates fell below the levels of the prior year for the same month and continued to decline until the end of September."",
  ""Mortgage rates have increased since the beginning of October, but they still remain lower now than they were last year."",
  ""In addition, Web traffic continues to be very strong."",
  ""For the last month of the quarter, as well as the month of November, weekly visits to our website were only surpassed by the COVID surge of 2022 and 2021."",
  ""This trend makes me particularly optimistic about future demand."",
  ""On slide 11, we give even more granularity and show the trend of monthly contracts per community compared to the same month a year ago."",
  ""Other than the month of September when our sales pace was flat compared to the previous year, our contracts per community were up significantly compared to the same month the previous year."",
  ""As you can also see on the slide, BFRs were not very impactful in any of the months shown."",
  ""We continue to believe that many of the fundamentals that led to our outperformance remain intact, such as the low supply of existing homes for sale and the good jobs report."",
  ""Furthermore, the overall health of the economy and positive demographic trends remain solid."",
  ""Turning to slide 12, we show contracts per community as if we had a September 30 quarter end."",
  ""That way, we can compare our results to our peers that report contracts per community on a calendar quarter end."",
  ""At 10.7 contracts per community, our September quarterly sales pace is the third highest among public homebuilders that reported at this time."",
  ""This occurred despite September being one of the slower months in the quarter as I showed you on the previous slide."",
  ""On slide 13, you can see that our year-over-year growth in contracts per community for the same period was the second highest among our peers."",
  ""Again, this was as if our quarter ended in September, so we could compare to many other companies."",
  ""The following two months were dramatically stronger in sales for us."",
  ""What we're trying to illustrate on these last two slides is that we are still selling an above average number of homes compared to our peers."",
  ""On the top of slide 14, you can see that for a sizable percentage of our deliveries, our homebuyers continue to utilize mortgage rate buydowns."",
  ""The percentage of customers that used buydowns in this year's fourth quarter was 72%."",
  ""The buydown usage in our deliveries indicates that buyers have been consistently relying on these mortgage rate buydowns to combat affordability at the current mortgage rate levels."",
  ""Given the persistently high mortgage rate environment, we assume buydowns will remain at similar levels going forward."",
  ""We are budgeting the cost of the same buydowns to remain constant."",
  ""As I said earlier, this includes the analysis of any new land acquisitions."",
  ""We continue to find land opportunities for growth even with these high levels of incentives."",
  ""In order to meet homebuyers' desires to use mortgage rate buydowns, we're intentionally operating with an elevated level of quick-move-in homes or QMIs, as we call them, so that we can offer affordable mortgage rate buydowns in the near term."",
  ""On slide 15, we show that we had 7.9 QMIs per community at the end of the fourth quarter, which is consistent with where it was at the end of the third quarter."",
  ""We define QMIs, by the way, as a home once we start the building."",
  ""In the fourth quarter of 2024, QMI sales were 72% of our total sales, an increase from 67% in the third quarter of 2024."",
  ""Historically, that percentage was about 40%."",
  ""Obviously, demand for these QMIs remains high, so we are very comfortable with the current level of QMIs per community."",
  ""Due to the increase in community count in the quarter, it's not surprising that our finished QMIs increased to 233 finished homes."",
  ""On a per community basis, that puts us at 1.8 finished QMIs per community."",
  ""That's up slightly from 1.5 finished QMIs per community at the end of the third quarter, but it's lower than the 1.9 QMIs at our first quarter."",
  ""Our goal with QMIs is obviously to sell them before completion."",
  ""During the fourth quarter, we emphasized pace versus price."",
  ""We're pleased with the significant increase in sales pace and the effect on ROI."",
  ""This did result in a lower gross margin for the fourth quarter and an even lower margin in our guidance for the first quarter of 2025."",
  ""But again, the tradeoff of pace versus price resulting in lower margin is producing great returns on inventory for us."",
  ""The decrease in gross margin is primarily due to increased use of incentives, particularly in the West."",
  ""The focus on quick-move-in homes results in more contracts that are signed and delivered in the same quarter, which leads to higher backlog conversion."",
  ""Our fourth quarter is an extreme example of this increase, as 31% of our homes delivered in the fourth quarter were contracted in the same quarter."",
  ""This resulted in a backlog conversion ratio of 86%."",
  ""This is the highest backlog conversion ratio we've had for the past 14 years."",
  ""We'll continue to manage our QMIs at a community level."",
  ""We track our start schedule at a community level, and we make sure that there is a match with our current sales pace per community so that we don't get too far ahead of ourselves."",
  ""If you move to slide 16, you can see that even with the economic and political uncertainty as well as the higher mortgage rates, we are still able to raise net prices in 34% of our communities during the fourth quarter."",
  ""While we are focusing on pace versus price, we are still able to raise prices in about a third of our communities."",
  ""Turning to slide 17, I'll add that in addition to the use of our incentives and the increased level of QMIs, we also attribute part of our performance metrics to the introduction of our new national portfolio of home designs that we referred to as Looks."",
  ""The new designs feature curated interiors with simple and honest pricing that reduced the complexity of the selection process for the homebuyers and the building process for us."",
  ""There are significant other advantages to our Looks programs, but we'll discuss that at some point in the future."",
  ""The current high levels of demand should support the growth that we're focused on achieving over the next several years."",
  ""I'll now turn it over to Brad O'Connor, our Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""I just wanted to wrap up the call by saying that we're very excited about the growth we hope to achieve in fiscal 2025."",
  ""Our recent sales have been fantastic."",
  ""In the fourth quarter, again, contracts increased 48%, and then we follow that up with a 55% growth in contracts in November."",
  ""These are very strong year-over-year improvements, and these are improvements over last year which was a great year for us."",
  ""Some of you might be concerned about our gross margin guidance for the first quarter."",
  ""Although these contracts are at a lower gross margin, I want to repeat that we made a conscious effort on trading pace for margin, given our focus on inventory turns, EBIT ROIs and QMIs."",
  ""The improved sales pace and the expected corresponding growth in revenues should result in continued industry-leading inventory turns, EBIT ROI and ROE over the coming year."",
  ""In closing, the housing market continues to show positive fundamentals, notwithstanding the affordability challenges."",
  ""Given the growth in our lot count, our community count and our land and land development spend, we think we are really well positioned to drive delivery growth in excess of 10% on an annual basis over the next few years, and we expect to continue to deliver top tier industry returns for our shareholders."",
  ""That concludes our formal comments, and we're happy to turn it over for Q&A., Marvin, and  all for participating in this morning's call to review the results for our fourth quarter and year-end."",

  ""Joining me today are Ara Hovnanian, Chairman, President and CEO; Brad O'Connor, CFO and Treasurer; and David Mitrisin, Vice President, Corporate Controller."",
  ""I'll now turn the call over to Ara."",
  ""On slide 18, you can see that we ended the quarter with a total of 147 open for sale communities, a 14% increase from last year."",
  ""130 of those communities were wholly owned."",
  ""During the fourth quarter, we opened 21 new wholly owned communities and sold out of 17 wholly owned communities."",
  ""We had 17 unconsolidated joint venture communities at the end of the fourth quarter."",
  ""We opened one new unconsolidated joint venture community and closed four unconsolidated joint venture communities during the quarter."",
  ""Even with the growth in community count this quarter, we still experienced delays in opening new communities, primarily due to utility hookups throughout the country."",
  ""We expect the unit count to continue to grow further in fiscal 2025."",
  ""The leading indicator for further community count growth is shown on slide 19."",
  ""We ended the quarter with 41,891 controlled lots, which equates to a 7.8 years supply of controlled lot."",
  ""Our lot count increased 6% sequentially and 32% year-over-year."",
  ""If you include lots from our unconsolidated joint ventures, we now control 44,720 lots."",
  ""We added 5,500 lots and 56 future communities during the fourth quarter."",
  ""Our land teams are actively engaging with land sellers negotiating for new land parcels that meet our underwriting standards."",
  ""In fiscal 2024, we began talking about our pivot to growth."",
  ""This followed a stretch of several years where we used a significant amount of the cash we generated to pay down debt."",
  ""On slide 20, we show our land and land development spend for each quarter going back five years."",
  ""You can see how that pivot to growth has impacted our land and land development spend."",
  ""During the fourth quarter of 2024, our land and land development spend increased 45% year-over-year to $318 million."",
  ""You can clearly see that the land and land development spend in every quarter of fiscal 2024 was the highest over the five years shown on this slide."",
  ""Our fourth quarter represented the highest quarterly spend since 2010 when we started reporting that metric."",
  ""Our corporate land committee continues to be busy, which is an indication that our lot count should continue to increase over time, but not always in a straight line."",
  ""We are using current home prices, including the current level of mortgage rate, buydowns and other incentives, current construction cost and current sales based underwrite to a 20-plus percent internal rate of return."",
  ""Our underwriting standards automatically self adjust to any changes in market conditions."",
  ""We are finding many opportunities in our market that are very focused on growing our top and bottom lines for the long term."",
  ""And this growth in lots controlled precedes growth in community count, which precedes growth in deliveries."",
  ""We are very pleased with the trends."",
  ""On slide 21, we show the percentage of our lots controlled via option increased from 46% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 to 84% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""This is the highest percentage of option lots we've ever had, continuing our strategic focus on land life."",
  ""Turning now to slide 22, you see that we continue to have one of the higher percentages of land controlled via option compared to our peers."",
  ""Needless to say, with the second highest percentage of optioned lots, we are significantly above the median."",
  ""On slide 23, compared to our peers, we have the second highest inventory turnover rate."",
  ""High inventory turns are a key component of our overall strategy."",
  ""We believe we have opportunity to continue to increase our use of land options and further improve our returns on inventory in future periods."",
  ""Our focus on pace versus price is evident here."",
  ""Even after spending a record $318 million on land and land development, we ended the fourth quarter with $338 million of liquidity, which is above the high end of our targeted liquidity range."",
  ""Turning now to slide 25."",
  ""This slide shows our maturity ladder as of October 31, 2024."",
  ""Over the past several years, we have taken a number of steps to improve our maturity ladder, and we remain committed to further strengthening our balance sheet going forward."",
  ""In February of 2025, one year prior to maturity, we plan to pay off all of the remaining $27 million of the 13.5% notes, which is our highest coupon debt."",
  ""Turning to slide 26, we show the progress we've made to-date to grow our equity and reduce our debt."",
  ""Starting on the upper left-hand part of the slide, we show the $1.3 billion growth in equity over the past few years."",
  ""During the same period, on the upper right-hand portion, you can see the $700 million reduction in debt."",
  ""On the bottom of the slide, you can see that our net debt to net cap at the end of fiscal 2024 was 49.3%, which is a significant improvement from our 146.2% at the beginning of fiscal 2020."",
  ""We still have more work to do to achieve our goal of a mid-30% level, but we are comfortable that we are on a path to achieve our target soon."",
  ""We've made considerable progress, which is evidenced by the credit rating upgrades we received from both S&P Global and Moody's during fiscal 2024."",
  ""Our balance sheet has improved significantly over the last five years, and we expect to continue to make noteworthy progress moving forward."",
  ""Given our remaining $241 million of deferred tax assets, we will not have to pay federal income taxes on approximately $800 million of future pre-tax earnings."",
  ""This benefit will continue to significantly enhance our cash flows in years to come and will accelerate our growth plans."",
  ""Regarding guidance, our internal plan, given our significant new community openings and current sales pace, is for substantial growth in deliveries and revenues in fiscal 2025, which is off to a spectacular start."",
  ""However, given the volatility and a difficulty in projecting margins with moving interest rates and volatility in general, we will focus our guidance on the current quarter, the first quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""Our financial guidance for the first quarter of 2025 assumes no adverse changes in current market conditions, including no further deterioration in our supply chain or material increases in mortgage rates, inflation or cancellation rates."",
  ""Our guidance assumes continued extended construction cycle times averaging five months compared to our pre-COVID cycle time for construction of approximately four months."",
  ""It also assumes that we continue to be more reliant on QMI sales, which makes forecasting gross margins more difficult."",
  ""Our guidance assumes continued use of mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives similar to recent months."",
  ""Further, it excludes any impact to SG&A expense from our phantom stock expense related solely to the stock price movement from $176.04 stock price at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024."",
  ""I also want to emphasize that our first quarter has historically been our lowest performing quarter in terms of gross margin, SG&A and pre-tax, and 2025 will not be different."",
  ""Slide 27 shows our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""Our expectations for total revenues for the first quarter is to be between $650 million and $750 million."",
  ""Adjusted gross margin is expected to be in the range of 17.5% to 18.5%."",
  ""This is lower than a typical gross margin particularly because of the cost of mortgage rate buydowns and our focus on pace versus price."",
  ""Keep in mind that all else being equal, first quarter gross margins are lower than the rest of the year as a result of a lower volume given there are some period costs in cost of sales."",
  ""We expect the range for SG&A as a percentage of total revenue to be between 13.5% and 14.5%, which is still higher than usual."",
  ""One of the reasons our SG&A is running a little high is that we are gearing up for significant community count growth and we have to make new hires in advance of those communities."",
  ""The upcoming growth is evident from our land position and land spend."",
  ""In addition, as we have said before, our first quarter is typically our lowest volume quarter, and therefore SG&A as a percent of revenues is often the highest in the first quarter."",
  ""We expect income from joint ventures to be between $15 million and $30 million."",
  ""Our guidance for adjusted EBITDA is between $55 million and $65 million."",
  ""And our expectations for adjusted pre-tax income for the first quarter is between $25 million and $35 million."",
  ""Turning to slide 28, we show that our return on equity was 34.6%, the second highest over the trailing 12 months compared to our peers."",
  ""And on slide 29, we show that compared to our peers, we have one of the highest consolidated EBIT returns on investment at 30.7%."",
  ""While our ROE was helped by our leverage, our EBIT return on investment is a true measure of pure homebuilding operating performance without regard to leverage and was the highest among our midsized peers."",
  ""We believe we are striking a good balance between pace and price, which is delivering industry leading ROIs and ROEs."",
  ""Over the last several years, we have consistently had one of the highest ROIs among our peers."",
  ""Eventually, investors will recognize our consistent superior returns on capital and significantly improved balance sheet."",
  ""Given our rapidly growing book value, we think it would be appropriate to consider a variety of metrics, including EBIT return on investment, enterprise value to EBITDA, and our price to earnings multiple when establishing a fair value for our stock."",
  ""We believe when all of the fundamental financial metrics are considered, our stock is one of the most compelling values in the industry."",
  ""On slide 30, we show our price to book multiple compared to our peers, and we are just above the median."",
  ""On slide 31, we show the trailing 12-month price to earnings ratio for us and our peer group."",
  ""Based on our price earnings, multiple of 5.98 times at yesterday's stock price of $189.96."",
  ""We are trading at a 45% discount to the homebuilding industry average PE ratio if you consider all public builders and a 36% discount when considering our midsized peers."",
  ""We recognize that our stock may trade at a discount to the group because of our higher leverage, but our leverage has been shrinking and our equity has been growing rapidly."",
  ""On slide 32, we show that despite our extremely high ROE, there are a number of peers that have a higher price to book ratio than us."",
  ""This slide more visibly demonstrates how much we are undervalued relative to the other builders when looking at the relationship between ROE and price to book, a very similar result exists when looking at ROE to price to earnings."",
  ""On slide 33, you can see an even more glaring disconnect with our high EBIT ROI and our PE."",
  ""We have the third highest EBIT ROI, and yet our stock trades at the lowest multiple to earnings of the group."",
  ""These last four slides further emphasize our point that given our high return on equity and return on investment, combined with our rapidly improving balance sheet, we believe our stock continues to be the most undervalued in the entire universe of public homebuilders."",
  ""I will now turn it back over to Ara for some brief closing remarks.""

  "" for all the commentary so far."",
  ""I'd love to drill in a little more on the strategy – shift might be too strong of a word, but just the kind of the pace versus price kind of decision right now."",
  ""And clearly a bit of a change this quarter."",
  ""I think we had always expected margins to gradually pull back from the recent levels we've seen."",
  ""But admittedly, it's happening a lot quicker than even we would have expected."",
  ""And I know this is intentional on your part, but 18% gross margin plus or minus is kind of back to where you were pre-pandemic."",
  ""And it kind of brings your EBIT margin levels down to something in that kind of mid, maybe high single-digit range."",
  ""And I'm just curious, if you think about the outlook for 2025, it doesn't sound like you're anticipating much change in incentives."",
  ""You do have some unknowns out there with tariffs and labor costs and things like that."",
  ""Is there a level of gross margin, if you were to see some cost creep, where you would perhaps shift back to maybe more of a price over pace dynamic, maybe pull back a little bit on the QMIs or the start base in order to try to preserve that margin?"",
  ""Or do you feel like there's enough in the bag here that you can kind of maintain this level 18% plus or minus and drive that 10% growth regardless of happens on cost?"",
  ""No, I appreciate all that added color and understood on all those points, and I think it makes a lot of sense."",
  ""Brad, I was going to – my second part was going to be kind of on the topic you ended with, which is kind of the asset-light, land-light strategy and how it gives you that flexibility to either attempt to renegotiate or maybe walk away from deals that no longer make sense."",
  ""I'm just curious if you've started that process in any markets or any communities at this point."",
  ""Are there any deals where they're no longer making economic sense of the prior underwriting?"",
  ""Or is that still kind of a ways off into the future?"",
  ""Makes a lot of sense."",
  ""And one last quick housekeeping question."",
  ""The joint venture guide for $15 million to $30 million, is that kind of just straight profitability from JVs or are there any consolidations contemplated within that guide like you had last quarter?"",
  ""Good luck and happy holidays."",
  "", guys, and great job in the quarter."",
  ""Glad to see the growth is coming."",
  ""I wanted to ask about, is there any thought or possibility that you guys could be taking out the debt earlier than its maturity and able to swap it for a lower interest rate debt?"",
  ""I mean, that's the hope."",
  ""As far as share buybacks, I couldn't figure out if you guys bought any this quarter."",
  ""I know you did in the last couple of quarters."",
  ""And as far as your shift towards increasing sales pace, is there like an average target you guys are trying to aim at?"",
  ""And if I could ask one more, I saw some homes advertised with a 3.5% mortgage rate."",
  ""And I was wondering if that was just a temporary thing that led to the lower guidance."",
  ""In other words, if you're no longer offering that, is there a chance that margins could bounce back in the back half of the year?"",
  ""Well, best of luck for 2025."",
  ""Hey, guys,  for taking my question and you answered several of them already."",
  ""You talked about SG&A as a percentage of revenues."",
  ""I guess 4it was 11.4% in the year."",
  ""Can you give us a sense like what that can trend towards in future periods and kind of as you scale your business, and how that would potentially offset some amount of gross margins?"",
  ""Well, Alan, first, I'll note that you certainly were accurate about projecting margin for the industry would drift down from the particularly high levels that they were just post-pandemic."",
  ""But I do want to remind you of two things."",
  ""Number one, as Brad said, our first quarter gross margins have historically been the lowest."",
  ""That is the case again this year."",
  ""And while that may seem counterintuitive, as Brad mentioned, there are some fixed cost, particularly construction overhead, that are time related."",
  ""So it's not just cost subtracted from price."",
  ""We do expect improvement over the quarters from that level."",
  ""But given the volatility, we're just going to project a quarter at a time."",
  ""The second point, I just lost my train of thought."",
  ""Brad, you want to jump in on a second point on margin?"",
  ""But I'll focus on that point – I was going to enunciate it."",
  ""We are shifting to a greater land light."",
  ""It's always been part of our strategy."",
  ""It's becoming even more of our strategy."",
  ""As you saw from some of the graphs, land-light gross margins are inherently lower than wholly-owned gross margins, which is what we were pre-pandemic that you're comparing to."",
  ""If everything was perfect, our gross margin should go down because you pay more for a land-light lot than you do for a wholly-owned lot that you carry for two years or three years."",
  ""But we'd done a lot of analysis and we think our ROI and earnings are much better off with lower margins and higher turnover and a higher sales pace."",
  ""I want to focus, Alan, on a 55% increase in sales last month following the 48% increase in sales for the quarter."",
  ""That, along with what Brad mentioned, the benefits of SG&A, we feel very comfortable are going to offset the margin decrease and it's a tradeoff that's very well worth it."",
  ""We don't currently expect our gross margins to fall."",
  ""We actually expect them to be up from the first quarter for all the reasons that we mentioned."",
  ""Alan, I'll mention one other fact that's interesting and has not been focused on very often, and that is that as we go more toward a land-light strategy and as you saw, we're one of the leaders in that area."",
  ""Our balance sheet has a lower percentage of land and land development as a percentage of our overall balance sheet compared to work in process."",
  ""And I mentioned that because it really is a risk reducer, because if the market slows down, it's much easier to turn a finished home into liquidity than it does a raw or developed lot into liquidity."",
  ""So we feel like one of the side benefits of the QMI strategy is more safety as well because you could get liquidity extremely fast, even faster than we were able to in prior cycles."",
  ""However, I think it's fair to emphasize that as the call premiums become more reasonable, there will be significant savings and interest if all things hold semi-steady with the current levels."",
  ""When we do refinance, there will be significant savings in our interest cost, and it's not way out in the future."",
  ""The opportunities are going to be coming pretty soon as our call premium is reduced rapidly."",
  ""We just look at pricing and pace on a community-by-community basis."",
  ""So we don't have a specific target."",
  ""I'll add that similar to retail stores, even if a community offers a 3.5% 30-year fixed, it doesn't mean every home in the community is."",
  ""It's usually for a select number of homes that have been finished and are ready to deliver."",
  ""It's not an across the board offering."",
  ""We are pleased with the results for our last quarter, and we look forward to giving you continued great results during fiscal 2025."",
  ""I think one of the things I'll add, Alan, is as we drive for growth that we've been talking about, our EBIT margins should improve because our SG&A will improve with more volume."",
  ""So you start to squeeze some of the other components of EBIT margin through the volume."",
  ""So if gross margin comes down a little, you can make room for it with better SG&A percentage, with growth."",
  ""The other thing is, as we think about whether we would pull back on gains, and I think that's what Yeah."",
  ""We haven't had to do that yet, Alan."",
  ""Certainly something we look at with every community as its performing."",
  ""Fortunately, we haven't had to walk away or frankly renegotiate anything at the moment."",
  ""As you can see in our numbers, we did have a couple of impairments for stuff that we did where we were underperforming and we had to take an impairment."",
  ""But our walkaways have been very normal, which is typically walkaways that happened during the due diligence period as opposed to something that happens once we've gotten going."",
  ""So fortunately, so far, no, we have not had to do that."",
  ""That's just straight normal JV income."",
  ""There's no consolidation considered in that number."",
  ""I mean, it's something that we're looking at."",
  ""As you'd probably know, a lot of our debt currently has pretty high prepayment penalties."",
  ""So it's a balance of considering what the lower rate might be versus the cost of doing that."",
  ""As I mentioned, we're going to pay off the $27 million that's coming due in 2026."",
  ""We'll do that in a year early."",
  ""So just in a few months here, we're going to pay that off."",
  ""But otherwise, we are monitoring as the call premiums reduce versus what we expect we might be able to issue new debt out and consider when we should do that."",
  ""So it's something we're definitely paying attention to."",
  ""But those We did not have any in the fourth quarter."",
  ""It's something we'd certainly consider in many cases because we've moved to more land light."",
  ""We've got scheduled land take requirements, lot take requirements per month or per quarter."",
  ""So we want to at least make sure we're hitting a sales pace that hits those requirements, that we go faster, we can buy it a lot faster."",
  ""And so we would consider doing that, but we certainly want to make sure we're at least hitting the pace we need to hit the minimum lot takedowns."",
  ""There's certainly a chance the margins could get better in the back half of the year."",
  ""It all depends on what happens with mortgage rates, what happens with the market, and what it takes them to sell the homes and maintain the pace we want to maintain."",
  ""The example you gave on our website, we do have those advertisements in those incentives by communities so we could have one or two communities that might have very low rate while other communities wouldn't be as low."",
  ""So it's certainly something we look at every community, how that community is performing, what the peers, competitors to that community are offering and make sure we're competitive."",
  ""But to your point about whether margins could get better late in the year, we absolutely think that could happen if the market were to get stronger or mortgage rates come down and the cost of the buydowns were giving decreases."",
  ""So that's certainly a possibility."",
  ""I think as we grow, we've talked about the fact that we've had to invest ahead of some of that growth."",
  ""But as we intimated in the remarks, we said we think we're positioned for 10-plus percent growth over the next few years."",
  ""And if we can achieve that, I think SG&A goes from 11.4% to something south of 10% ultimately, which still would put us at the high end of the range of our homebuilding peers."",
  ""So we are continuing to look at ways to drive that further."",
  ""But just pure growth should get us in the single digits over the next couple of years if we can grow the way we anticipate.""

  ""Our teams delivered strong performance with record quarterly sales of over $2 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $277 million."",
  ""We have once again shown that Core & Main can grow in any environment."",
  ""Our ongoing focus on driving organic market share gains, combined with our disciplined approach to M&A, enabled us to achieve nearly 12% sales growth in the third quarter."",
  ""We will discuss our results in more detail later in our prepared remarks."",
  ""But first, I'll begin on page 5 of the presentation with some emerging themes in the water sector."",
  ""The United States continues to face a growing disparity between water supply and demand, driven by a combination of environmental, demographic and economic factors."",
  ""Groundwater reserves are being depleted at a rapid pace, especially in agricultural areas reliant on irrigation."",
  ""Aging water infrastructure compounds the problem as leaks and inefficiencies lead to significant losses in a resource that is becoming increasingly scarce."",
  ""Together, these factors create a challenging situation for maintaining reliable water supply."",
  ""At the same time, demand for water is surging."",
  ""Population growth is driving higher consumption levels for municipal and domestic use."",
  ""Economic development, including energy production and expanding industrialization, also requires vast amounts of water."",
  ""Meanwhile, agriculture, which accounts for approximately 70% of freshwater use in the US, continues to consume large quantities to meet the demands of a growing population."",
  ""Without significant efforts to improve water conservation and repair and upgrade aging infrastructure, the gap between water supply and demand will continue to widen."",
  ""Addressing the widening gap requires bold investments in modernizing and expanding water infrastructure and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act provides a critical opportunity to do so."",
  ""The Act allocates billions of dollars to improve water systems across the US, funding projects to repair aging pipelines, upgrade treatment facilities, and develop technologies for water reuse and recycling."",
  ""These investments, which we expect will continue to receive bipartisan support, are crucial for enhancing efficiency and reducing water loss, ensuring that every drop counts in a time of increasing scarcity."",
  ""With our extensive product and service portfolio spanning water, wastewater, storm drainage and fire protection systems, Core & Main is well-positioned to play an important role in meeting the growing demand for infrastructure upgrades and supporting the development of resilient future-ready water systems."",
  ""Turning now to our end markets in the third quarter."",
  ""The residential end market was modestly positive and there continues to be significant pent-up demand for new housing in the US."",
  ""If mortgage rates come down and affordability improves, we expect to see stronger levels of residential construction activity as homebuyers reenter the market, unlocking demand that has been accumulating over the past few years."",
  ""The non-residential end market remained stable and our backlog and bidding activity continued to grow."",
  ""This momentum strengthens our confidence in our outlook."",
  ""Municipal repair and replacement activity continues to be resilient, and we were pleased to see an increase in new project starts from the second quarter."",
  ""We are also beginning to see more projects funded by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, signaling a positive trajectory for investments in municipal water infrastructure in 2025 and beyond."",
  ""Each of our end markets benefit from secular growth trends that are expected to continue over the long term."",
  ""Municipal demand, which represents over 40% of our business, has demonstrated steady growth historically due to the critical need to replace aged water infrastructure."",
  ""With better access to capital, higher water utility rates and federal funding on the horizon, we expect this market to grow steadily for the foreseeable future."",
  ""Residential and non-residential construction activity remained below long-term historical averages when adjusting for population growth."",
  ""And both end markets are poised to benefit from demographic shifts, population growth, a shortage of buildable lots for new homes, and the need for non-residential infrastructure to support the expansion of suburban and rural communities."",
  ""Moving to our operations, our facilities in the Southeast were up and running again shortly after Hurricanes Helene and Milton passed, and they suffered minimal damage."",
  ""Hurricanes can be disruptive to our operations in the short term, but they can create medium- and long-term tailwinds for our business."",
  ""In the short term, shipments slow down as products are not able to be brought onto the job sites due to the destruction, flooding and ground saturation."",
  ""And many of our customers are focused on the recovery efforts."",
  ""Over the medium term, we typically see a favorable impact from critical infrastructure repairs."",
  ""And over the long term, new projects and regulations are designed and constructed to handle higher volumes of storm water."",
  ""Our associates in Florida and Carolinas are safe and accounted for, but many had their lives disrupted and we continue to offer support to those who need assistance."",
  ""Our product customer geographic expansion initiatives continue to outpace core end market growth, highlighted by the 24% growth we achieved in meter sales during the quarter and supplemented by our execution on water and wastewater treatment plant projects."",
  ""Last quarter, we talked about our position as one of the nation's leading providers of advanced metering solutions and the value proposition we bring to our municipal customers."",
  ""We are also a leading provider of engineered products that are found within water and wastewater treatment plants."",
  ""We have historically focused on the connections that bring water and sewer utilities to and from treatment plants and their customers."",
  ""But these treatment plant projects provide us with a substantial opportunity to expand inside the fence, selling a wider variety of specialty valves and equipment."",
  ""We have continued to invest in key talent that understands the unique specifications for treatment plants, have the knowledge to navigate the complex funding processes they follow."",
  ""These investments, coupled with our partnerships with national contractors who specialize in these projects, have been key to our growth."",
  ""We also opened new locations in Hayden, Idaho and Chattanooga, Tennessee, during and after the quarter, expanding our geographic reach and allowing us to better serve our waterworks customers in key markets."",
  ""Each time we add a new location, we add key talent that enhance our value proposition, giving us the opportunity to earn market share."",
  ""Our team is actively evaluating a pipeline of priority markets to expand into, and we have plans to open more locations over the next several quarters."",
  ""We expanded gross margins by 20 basis points sequentially from the second quarter through the success of our initiatives."",
  ""We have done a tremendous job structurally enhancing gross margins over the years through the addition and expansion of our private label strategy, driving synergies through M&A, and optimizing the way we source and price our products."",
  ""We have been very transparent about the temporary gross margin tailwinds we have experienced over the past two years, and our expectation for gross margin normalization."",
  ""As we communicated last quarter, we expected that gross margins had normalized, providing a solid baseline for us to build upon moving forward."",
  ""We generated robust operating cash flow of $260 million during the quarter, and our disciplined approach to capital allocation further demonstrates our commitment to growth and creating value for shareholders."",
  ""We completed five acquisitions during and after the quarter to expand our presence in key geographies, gain access to new product lines and add key talent."",
  ""We also deployed $100 million to repurchase and retire nearly 2.5 million shares under our share repurchase program."",
  ""We operate an asset-light model which has allowed us to convert between 60% to 70% of our adjusted EBITDA into operating cash flow historically."",
  ""We expect to maintain that same level of operating cash flow generation going forward, resulting in significant available capital that we will reinvest back into the business and return to shareholders."",
  ""We highlighted the acquisition of HM Pipe Products, GroGreen Solutions, and Green Equipment Company in our second quarter call in September."",
  ""We completed two more acquisitions since then, including Eastcom Associates and ARGCO Northeast."",
  ""Eastcom Associates is a distributor of utility protection equipment with a single location in New Jersey."",
  ""Since 1972, the Eastcom team has provided exceptional service to surveyors and contractors across 13 states, by offering damage prevention equipment, training and services."",
  ""They have a strong reputation for their commitment to being dependable partner and we are excited to welcome them to the Core & Main family."",
  ""ARGCO Northeast is a single branch distributor of fire protection products and services operating in New Jersey."",
  ""They have become a trusted partner to the customers they serve, delivering top quality fire protection products and outstanding support."",
  ""They mirror our own level of commitment to customers here at Core & Main."",
  ""We look forward to partnering with them to further our customer success."",
  ""On a combined basis, the five acquisitions we completed during and after the quarter generate roughly $150 million of annualized net sales."",
  ""And year-to-date, we have now completed 10 acquisitions with combined annualized net sales of approximately $620 million."",
  ""Integrating new businesses is a complex process that involves aligning diverse systems, operations and cultures to create one cohesive organization."",
  ""Our integration process is well-defined, scalable and highly flexible based on the needs of each acquisition."",
  ""With an experienced team, deep relationships with high-performing companies, and a reputation as the acquirer of choice in our industry, we remain well-positioned to grow through acquisitions for many years to come."",
  ""Lastly, I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with our key investment highlights and what makes Core & Main an exceptional business."",
  ""Core & Main stands out as an industry leader in a large and growing $39-billion addressable market."",
  ""We are one of only two national distributors competing in our space with the remainder of the market served by hundreds of other local and regional distributors."",
  ""Our local presence and expertise are backed by national scale."",
  ""We can utilize our size and resources to capitalize on new growth opportunities, strengthen our competitive edge, deliver even better products and services that support our customers."",
  ""As I mentioned earlier, the end markets we serve are supported by secular tailwinds, including the undersupply of housing relative to population growth and household formations, the critical need to repair and upgrade municipal water systems, and a growing focus on water sustainability."",
  ""We have multiple levers to drive organic growth, including investments in greenfields, the addition of new sales talent, our ability to drive the adoption of new products throughout the industry, and our relentless focus on proving our value proposition at the local level."",
  ""We also have multiple levers to drive sustainable margin expansion, including the expansion of our private label portfolio, optimizing the way we source and price our products and driving operational efficiencies throughout our vast distribution network."",
  ""Our ability to identify, execute and integrate acquisitions has been a cornerstone of our success, enabling us to expand our capabilities, increase market share, and deliver synergies across our network."",
  ""Core & Main is not just a distributor."",
  ""We differentiate ourselves through a comprehensive portfolio of product and service offerings enhanced by proprietary technology tools that streamline workflows, improve efficiency, and deliver a superior experience to our customers."",
  ""We are a trusted source to our customers because of our operational excellence across all products, services and markets."",
  ""Very rarely do our customers come to us with a list of materials."",
  ""Instead, they come to us with a project idea or engineered drawing, and we bring those projects to life by converting them into comprehensive material project plans."",
  ""Our geographic footprint and reach to local communities is also essential to our suppliers, as we have a large and highly knowledgeable sales force with boots on the ground and the ability to reach our fragmented customer base."",
  ""With a resilient financial profile characterized by strong cash flow generation, disciplined capital allocation and attractive return characteristics, Core & Main is well-positioned to create and deliver value for shareholders, while fulfilling its mission to advance reliable infrastructure across the communities we serve."",
  ""Before I turn it over to Mark, I want to take a moment to reflect on the past few quarters."",
  ""Our teams have had to navigate several challenges and distractions from dynamic market conditions to unprecedented weather events and other external factors beyond our control."",
  ""Our teams consistently rose to the occasion, demonstrating focus, agility, resilience and commitment."",
  ""Their continued ability to adapt, collaborate, focus on our customers and drive results speaks volumes about the strength of our culture and the dedication of our people."",
  "" for your ongoing support."",
  ""I look forward to what we will accomplish in the years ahead."",
  ""This is Robyn Bradbury, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations for Core & Main."",
  ""We are happy to have you join us this morning for our fiscal 2024 third quarter ."",
  ""I am joined today by Steve LeClair, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer; and Mark Witkowski, our Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Steve will lead today's call with a business update and an overview of our recent acquisitions."",
  ""Mark will then discuss our third quarter financial results and updated fiscal 2024 outlook, followed by a Q&A session."",
  ""We will conclude the call with Steve's closing remarks."",
  ""We issued our earnings press release this morning and posted a presentation to the Investor Relations section of our website."",
  ""Our press release, presentation and the statements made during this call may include forward-looking statements."",
  ""These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations and projection."",
  ""Such risks and uncertainties include the factors set forth in our earnings press release and in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."",
  ""We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we believe are useful in assessing the operating results of our business."",
  ""A reconciliation of these measures can be found in our earnings press release and in the appendix of our investor presentation."",
  "" for your interest in Core & Main."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to Chair and Chief Executive Officer, Steve LeClair."",
  ""I'd also like to extend my  to our teams for their hard work in delivering another record quarter."",
  ""We grew net sales approximately 12% in the third quarter to $2.04 billion."",
  ""As Steve mentioned, this was the highest level of quarterly sales in the company history."",
  ""Acquisitions contributed about 9% of our sales growth, and organic volumes were up mid-single digits due to a rebound in municipal project starts and more favorable weather conditions, which allowed our customers to resume some of the projects that were deferred last quarter."",
  ""As anticipated, pricing remained stable on a sequential basis."",
  ""Gross margins for the quarter finished at 26.6%, compared with 27% in the prior year, a difference of approximately 40 basis points."",
  ""During our second quarter call in September, we communicated our expectation that gross margin normalization had run its course and that we would be in a position to expand gross margins sequentially through the execution of our initiatives."",
  ""Our teams delivered on that, delivering strong execution to expand gross margins by 20 basis points from the second quarter."",
  ""Selling, general and administrative expenses increased 14% in the third quarter to $274 million."",
  ""The year-over-year increase in both SG&A, and SG&A as a percentage of net sales, primarily reflects the impact of acquisitions."",
  ""Interest expense in the third quarter was $36 million, compared with $20 million in the prior year."",
  ""The increase was primarily due to the addition of the $750-million term loan due 2031, and higher borrowings under our Senior ABL credit facility."",
  ""The provision for income taxes in the third quarter was $47 million, compared with $39 million in the prior year and our effective tax rates were 25.1% and 19.8%, respectively."",
  ""This quarter's effective tax rate reflects a more normalized ongoing rate, and the increase over the prior-year period was primarily due to exchanges of partnership interests in conjunction with secondary offerings and the repurchase transactions we completed in fiscal 2023."",
  ""We recorded $140 million in net income in the third quarter, compared with $158 million in the prior year."",
  ""The decrease in net income was primarily due to higher SG&A and amortization expenses and an increase in interest expense."",
  ""Diluted earnings per share increased approximately 6% in the third quarter to $0.69."",
  ""The increase in diluted earnings per share was due to lower share counts following the share repurchase transactions executed throughout fiscal years 2023 and 2024, partially offset by a decline in net income."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter increased approximately 7% to $277 million."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA margins decreased 60 basis points year-over-year to 13.6%, reflecting a 50-basis-point sequential improvement from the second quarter."",
  ""Moving to our balance sheet and cash flow."",
  ""We ended the quarter with net debt of approximately $2.4 billion, and our net debt leverage was 2.7 times."",
  ""Total liquidity was $1 billion, consisting of $10 million of cash and the remaining amount being excess availability under our ABL revolver."",
  ""We generated $260 million of operating cash flow during the quarter, reflecting over 90% conversion from adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""We continue to strategically allocate our cash flow, and our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged with investments in growth being our top priority."",
  ""This year, we have completed 10 acquisitions and we continue to have a healthy pipeline."",
  ""Our second priority is returning capital to shareholders and in the third quarter, we deployed $100 million to repurchase and retire 2.46 million shares under our share repurchase program."",
  ""This brings our year-to-date share repurchases to $121 million and 2.89 million shares in total."",
  ""As of today, approximately $379 million remains under our existing share repurchase authorization."",
  ""Before we head to Q&A, I'll wrap up my prepared remarks with a discussion on our updated outlook for fiscal 2024 and a framework to consider for fiscal 2025."",
  ""The municipal repair and replacement portion of our business remains resilient, and we continue to expect that our end markets will be stable for the remainder of fiscal 2024."",
  ""We expect the pricing environment to remain sequentially stable and we believe our gross margins will sustain at current levels through the fourth quarter."",
  ""With three quarters of the year behind us and considering our recent acquisitions, current backlogs and order trends, we are raising our full-year estimates for net sales and adjusted EBITDA."",
  ""We now expect net sales to range from $7.35 billion to $7.45 billion and we expect adjusted EBITDA to range from $915 million to $935 million."",
  ""This will mark our 15th consecutive year of positive sales growth, averaging approximately 10% annually over that period."",
  ""The consistency of this growth would not be possible without our resilient business model, the diversified end market mix we've developed over the years, the targeted investments we are making to support and execute our growth initiatives, and the expertise and dedication of our associates."",
  ""As we look beyond this year, our growth algorithm remains firmly intact."",
  ""We plan to provide our outlook for fiscal 2025 during next quarter's ."",
  ""However, as we sit here today, we generally expect end-market volumes will be positive next year depending on broader economic conditions, including the effect of interest rate movements and progress on federal infrastructure funding."",
  ""We are committed to driving 2 to 4 points of organic above-market growth through the execution of our product, customer and geographic expansion initiatives."",
  ""In terms of M&A, we anticipate 2 points of growth from acquisitions that have already closed so far this year."",
  ""We maintain a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities and expect to remain acquisitive as we progress through the rest of this year and into next year."",
  ""We're optimistic about our ability to achieve 30 to 50 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion annually through the execution of our initiatives, and we will strive to do this while producing strong operating cash flow at a rate of 60% to 70% of adjusted EBITDA on an ongoing basis."",
  ""We will continue deploying capital on initiatives that will drive above-market growth, including executing on our M&A pipeline and delivering on our organic growth initiatives."",
  ""We will maintain significant liquidity and balance sheet flexibility to continue driving shareholder value through share repurchases or dividends."",
  ""We have demonstrated that our business model is resilient, and we can deliver strong results in any environment."",
  ""We're looking forward to a strong finish to the year and helping our customers build more reliable infrastructure."",
  ""At this time, I'd like to open it up for questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions today."",
  ""The first is just on focusing on end markets and kind of first focusing on the municipal end market in particular."",
  ""You have current expectations for up low-single digits for 2024, and not that we're necessarily looking for 2025 guidance, but any thoughts on kind of the pace and momentum going into next year with the large amounts of IIJA money still to be spent?"",
  ""And the municipalities grant are generally steadier versus end markets, but there could be some unique tailwinds helping with that end market."",
  ""And if you could have just a similar commentary on the non-res end market, too, against the same backdrop."",
  ""So, just stepping back Okay."",
  ""And one follow-up just on the guidance raise, just a clarification."",
  ""If I missed this in the prepared commentary, apologies on my end."",
  ""But in terms of the raise, how much was driven by acquisitions in the quarter, or just a little bit better expectations?"",
  ""Just any color you can give just in terms of the breakout between those three buckets."",
  ""First question, it just feels like as we look into fiscal 2025, it is feeling more like a normal year relative to your growth algorithm on slide 12."",
  ""Could you just -- as you think about that, are there any unusual year-to-year factors on either growth or margin enhancement that we should consider as we look to model the next fiscal year?"",
  ""And then second, a little bit more broad here."",
  ""Obviously, we've been getting a lot of questions on presidential policy and that sort of thing."",
  ""Could you talk about both labor conditions and tariffs?"",
  ""I would assume labor, just given the technical nature of your customers' workforce, you probably don't have much in the way of immigration policy change risk there, but can you talk about that?"",
  ""And then tariffs, just if you could address the percentage of COGS that comes from Canada, Mexico or other outside US?"",
  ""And Mark, I think you've just given 2025 guidance, so  for that."",
  ""But, yeah, so just taking a step back to 3Q, sales came in quite a bit better than what you expected."",
  ""So, I'm just curious, you know, what drove the upside to your expectations."",
  ""And any thoughts on how much of the 2Q projects that were impacted by the weather came in and benefited 3Q?"",
  ""And then on pricing, your comment to us sequentially stable into the fourth quarter."",
  ""I'm curious, any perspectives on 2025, are we getting beyond now the fire protection, price deflation?"",
  ""And if you could maybe comment on the PVC pipe pricing environment, that's obviously a hot topic right now."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I want to stick with the pricing environment for my first one."",
  ""Obviously, as Nigel said, it's a hot topic right now."",
  ""Some of your – some users of pipe, some suppliers of pipe, they do – while pricing seems like it may not have come down significantly on the muni side yet, I think there are still some comments out in the industry about expectations for a continued decline."",
  ""So, your comments probably stand out as a little bit different there, Mark."",
  ""So, maybe you guys can give a little more color, specifically on the muni side, on what you're seeing, what you're hearing, what gives you the confidence that might be more stable through next year?"",
  ""And I think that's the nuance we were looking for, and it's important for people to understand in terms of multi-product jobs, service orientation, and at a job level, the stability."",
  ""I guess the second question, you spent some time talking about the water treatment initiatives, and obviously that's part of a broader portfolio of growth initiatives that are building into your above-market growth expectations."",
  ""Can you just give us – there have been a couple different adjacency expansions, but help us kind of frame up like the opportunity and kind of the near and medium-term as you think about some of the big ones like treatment plants, like what's that specifically contributing to your expectations around the 2025 growth?"",
  ""Wanted to ask if you could rank order in perhaps greater detail, the building blocks behind the sequential improvement in gross margin."",
  ""I know you've already touched on some of these, but maybe just put a finer point on any benefit from acquisition accretion versus some of your self-help initiatives like strategic sourcing and private label."",
  ""And then apologies if I missed, but do you have an update on where private label sits as a percent of COGS?"",
  ""Is it still at 2%, or was there an increase in Q3 versus Q2?"",
  ""And then to follow up on the election question, another broad one here, any signs of interest in onshoring, given some of the policies of the incoming administration, some of the things they're looking to incentivize, and if we were to see those large onshoring type projects emerge, any sense as to when those projects would start to benefit your P&L specifically?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""Appreciate the 2025 end market margin And then on non-res, if you could comment on – if you have exposure to data center development, what that might be, and could that be a meaningful tailwind for that non-res end market for you, or not really?"",
  ""Just curious what you do from a data center perspective."",
  ""On the $55 billion of funding from IIJA, is it like a 10% of that being allocated, 20%, do you have any sense of numbers?"",
  ""Like how much – any sense on how much has been allocated so far?"",
  ""And then on the acquisition side, my second question, you've now done a couple of deals for these, I guess, distributors of instruments in utility locating, the damage prevention equipment, that sort of thing."",
  ""Can you provide a bit more color on these, like what's the opportunity here to scale this across the network?"",
  ""Is this a higher-margin product set?"",
  ""Any more color you can provide?"",
  ""I think it was Green Equipment and then the Eastcom Helpful color."",
  ""I just want to start by squaring the comments on organic growth."",
  ""It seems like volumes are up, call it 4% to 5% this quarter."",
  ""I know you have an extra week in the fourth quarter, and it seems like the volumes ex the 53rd week, I think your guidance is implying slightly down."",
  ""I just want to make sure I had that straight, and if so, anything you guys want to call out there?"",
  ""And then Steve, maybe going back to your comment from earlier around the delay you typically see when there's storm-related activity, and the uptake that you see in your business."",
  ""I guess, from all of the weather-related issues that we've seen this year, I mean, would you start to expect to see maybe some improvement or some bump in your business in the early parts of 2025?"",
  ""Does that start to come in, maybe even this quarter?"",
  ""Just any thoughts around that would be helpful."",
  ""First, on the units, and you've talked about this in several calls, but it was a pretty notable turnaround from the negative numbers you had in the second quarter."",
  ""Would there be any region that you would call out that was particularly strong during the period or any specific end user market around that third quarter number?"",
  ""And this has been referred to by several callers, but some of your suppliers have been receiving subpoenas around antitrust issues."",
  ""Have you received – are you party to any of these subpoenas?"",
  ""I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the M&A pipeline looks in general for 2025, and are you seeing any kind of increased competition for targets, or maybe new potential buyers, or valuations that maybe are less reasonable than you've seen in the past?"",
  ""And then just generally, with net leverage at 2.7 times, healthy, but a bit above the 2 times that you talked about at the Investor Day, just wondering if you can talk about what level of leverage you're willing to go to and just how we should think about that maybe next year."",
  ""And then just one follow-up."",
  ""I mean, a lot of your M&A has been kind of about expanding the product offering."",
  ""I was just curious, is there any kind of geographic whitespace or region that you're looking to enter that are worth noting?"",
  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""Actually, on that last point, Steve, you mentioned the greenfields."",
  ""I think you opened a couple in the quarter, and you mentioned that there's kind of a pipeline of priority markets going forward."",
  ""So, I guess, what is the typical ramp timeline of a greenfield branch for you guys in terms of hitting kind of normal branch revenue and profitability?"",
  ""And, I guess, how many greenfields would you look to be opening in 2025?"",
  ""And then secondly, I wanted to ask about sort of the near-term margins and what that implies for 2025."",
  ""I think you said gross margins should be kind of sequentially stable into the fourth quarter."",
  ""I guess that implies that SG&A dollars might be flattish sequentially, despite, I guess, lower sequential sales."",
  ""I just wanted to check if that's the case and why that would be the case."",
  ""But as you get into 2025 and you talk about 30 to 50 basis points of annual EBITDA margin expansion, given what's happening on SG&A right now, I mean, is the expectation for now that most of that margin expansion would be coming on the gross margin side?"",
  ""This is David Ridley-Lane on for Andrew Obin."",
  ""Just a quick sort of clarification question."",
  ""What percentage of your revenue today is multifamily?"",
  ""And I believe that's – just to confirm that's included in your non-residential category."",
  ""And just to put a – I know this has been asked before, but just to put a finer point on it, so, last quarter you said you lost about $50 million of revenue from the weather."",
  ""I did check, this quarter is a lot drier."",
  ""So, did you catch up on the full $50 million in the third quarter, or do you think that was – it was less than that?"",
  "", Kathryn, for the question."",
  ""Yeah, we saw really pretty stable and modest growth in municipal through the quarter."",
  ""And we saw the bidding activity and backlog continue to improve, really feel encouraged by what we're seeing."",
  ""IIJA funds are starting to become a little bit more prominent out there."",
  ""So, we're seeing a number of projects that are really hitting the – going from the drawing table to ultimately being executed in projects which we think will start delivering in 2025."",
  ""And these projects vary from what I would call large diameter, bigger projects, to some of the lead replacement pipes, which can be smaller dollars and a little less material for us, but it's good to start seeing those funds starting to flow through."",
  ""So, we're encouraged by what we're seeing with municipal."",
  ""Very much in line with what we were anticipating along those lines."",
  ""Non-residential has been good for us as well, too."",
  ""So, we've certainly seen, roads and bridges, and some of those areas continue to be strong."",
  ""A lot of the big megaprojects continue to be robust, as we've seen some of the localized areas there in terms of our fire protection activity and along with our underground work in those areas."",
  ""So, those things have really helped pull through a lot of the storm drainage materials and some of those products as well."",
  ""So, we'll continue to see that."",
  ""Non-residential, we talk about multi-family still struggling and still down, but that was anticipated."",
  ""So overall, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in the end markets as we get into the fourth quarter and then start 2025."",
  ""And we're definitely seeing some really good pockets, particularly municipal, starting to gain some traction."",
  ""Yeah, Dave, really hard to predict what would happen in terms of the labor situation over there."",
  ""My best guess is that we wouldn't see much of a change at all for the type of contractors that we're dealing with here."",
  ""In regards to the tariffs, generally, we view tariffs as a neutral to positive type impact for our business."",
  ""Very little of our product, most of them – the vast majority of our product is assembled and produced here in the United States, less than 15% comes in as import."",
  ""And for our direct import that we do ourselves, it's less than 2%."",
  ""So, we generally don't see a huge impact from the tariffs."",
  ""And if anything, it's, as we said, neutral to positive as we look at that going into this new administration."",
  ""Obviously a lot of attention on PVC, but I want to talk a little bit about what – when we talk about stable pricing, what that really means for us."",
  ""So, most of our sales are project-based."",
  ""So, our customers really are looking for us for a full suite of products associated to complete a project."",
  ""So, within that, there are numerous different product categories, well beyond PVC pipe."",
  ""And so, pricing itself is really based on a lot of different factors, whether it's demand and competition in the local market, complexity of the project, local specifications, and the price for which we procured the product."",
  ""So, when we talk about stable pricing, we're talking about stabilization across a lot of those different product categories, a lot of the different value that we can add into these projects in regards to the project management, the delivery, the quality of service, etcetera, and so, when we talk about where we're seeing stable pricing environment, that's what we're talking about."",
  ""As Mark mentioned, less than 15% of our product is PVC related, and many projects don't even have PVC associated with it."",
  ""we're already starting to see – most of our manufacturers are seeing increases in their cost."",
  ""So, we're already starting to see price increases for many different product categories coming in now for 2025."",
  ""So that's what gives us confidence right now for about a stable pricing environment."",
  ""Yeah, we won't break that out specifically."",
  ""But what I'd share with you is that over the last 10 years, we've really been building our capabilities in this space."",
  ""It is very long-cycle type work."",
  ""A lot of the projects that are being executed now are ones that were, you know, really were working on five-plus years ago, where we've gone through a lot of the design work initially with a lot of these contractors to help design and optimize the material flow to these projects."",
  ""And these projects will carry on for – generally have a duration, for us, once they're starting into the execution, for multi-years."",
  ""So, that's why we like this business."",
  ""It's one of those areas we've been able to invest in because we've got a long view on the industry, getting access to the products associated with this."",
  ""These are specialty type products, especially lined products."",
  ""All of them require special access and we've been able to build that capability over the last decade."",
  ""And so, we'll continue to see a lot of growth in that as the population expands and water treatment, and wastewater facilities continue to expand and new ones being developed and designed are right there in the forefront of these things and have a long pipeline ahead of us for projects to execute on."",
  ""Yeah, Sam, really way early innings on this one to really understand what our manufacturer sentiment would be about onshoring."",
  ""I will share with you that the vast majority of our manufacturers are onshore today."",
  ""It'll be interesting to see if there's other components, or, etcetera, that they're looking at, at maybe onshoring, but it's hard to tell."",
  ""I mean, we're just weeks into this thing and those cycles tend to take a little bit of planning on our manufacturers' standpoint to do that."",
  ""So, we'll see how that plays out."",
  ""Maybe have a little bit more color for you on the next quarter."",
  ""Patrick, both of those are really good businesses in regards to doing a lot of the utility servicing type areas with line detection and things along those lines."",
  ""We think now we cover a good number of states."",
  ""We're getting access to that product, which is something that our – all of our customers are pulling through at this point."",
  ""They've been buying it from other sources."",
  ""We believe we can add a lot of value in this and continue to do that."",
  ""In the big scheme of things, it's probably not something that we view as a multibillion-dollar market by any means, but it is a great complementary offering to what we're already serving and providing to our municipal customers across the board."",
  ""And these utility detection devices are fairly technologically advanced."",
  ""You get into radar and different types of things that are just really useful right now as these municipalities are looking to locate services that, quite frankly, have been buried for 60 to 70 years, and help facilitate a lot of the replacement of the product and the pipe that's in there."",
  ""Yeah, we definitely could see something coming into 2025."",
  ""What I'd share with you is that in Q2, the weather-related incidents we had were incredibly pervasive, from Texas all the way up into Wisconsin, all the way up North into the upper Midwest."",
  ""And that obviously had a huge impact on us in the second quarter."",
  ""If you look at kind of what happened really in this third quarter with the hurricanes, the back-to-back hurricanes with Hilton – Helene and Milton, both of those were fairly localized, and obviously caused a pause in some construction related activity that was happening there."",
  ""We – we'll continue to see that evolve and start to release into the fourth quarter."",
  ""And then in the medium and longer term, what we generally see are a much more robust replacement of water and storm drainage systems across the – across those areas that were impacted."",
  ""Some of them were completely wiped out in the Carolinas, and that's going to be a total rebuild in those areas for many of the utilities out there."",
  ""So, we'll continue to see some of that move into 2025 for sure."",
  ""No, we have not received any subpoenas, anything along those lines."",
  ""And just to reiterate, we are not named as a defendant in any of those cases, and we won't comment on anything regarding any of our suppliers, and in terms of the activity that's happened, we hold by our statements that we made last quarter."",
  ""Anthony, I'll talk about the M&A pipeline."",
  ""So, really everything that we've looked at so far this year and our pipeline that we've got going into next year, continues to remain very strong."",
  ""many cases that we're looking at, these have been sole sourced deals that we've been working with directly with owners along those lines."",
  ""We pride ourselves in being the acquirer of choice in the space."",
  ""The multiples that we're looking at are right in line with traditionally what we have continued to execute on through the last several years."",
  ""So, really don't see much change in that."",
  ""The pipeline has been robust, as you saw this year, and we've already executed 10 deals, so far, this year."",
  ""Continue to see a robust pipeline going into 2025 and would expect the same."",
  ""Mark, you want to talk little bit about leverage?"",
  ""Yeah, the filling areas that we've had, we continue to find great opportunities out there."",
  ""We've done a number of bolt-on acquisitions this year."",
  ""We've strengthened our positions in Arizona, Nevada, even in Texas and some of these other areas."",
  ""So, there continues to be a lot of robust areas in these local markets to continue to do that."",
  ""We also added in HM Pipe Products in Canada."",
  ""And so, we continue to look at the map on where we're at and continue to find opportunities."",
  ""Some cases there's really good acquisition targets in there and other cases we find is a great opportunity to do the greenfields that we've been rolling out as well, too."",
  ""So, we'll look at it along those lines."",
  ""A lot of great – a lot of space left for us to fill in a lot of dots out there."",
  "" all again for joining us today."",
  ""Our third quarter performance highlights our resilience, adaptability and commitment to operational excellence."",
  ""We achieved record sales and maintained strong operational performance underscoring the strength of our business model and our ability to drive growth."",
  ""By combining our local expertise with our national scale and innovative product offerings, we continue to deliver exceptional value to our customers and stakeholders."",
  ""Looking ahead, we remain focused on addressing our customers' critical infrastructure needs as the nation grapples with a widening gap between water supply and demand."",
  ""With significant federal investments on the horizon, we are well-positioned to capture long-term growth opportunities that exist while delivering sustainable expansion and value creation."",
  ""We are energized by the opportunities that lie ahead and are confident in our ability to drive meaningful progress across our strategic priorities."",
  ""We look forward to building on our success in the quarters to come."",
  ""Operator, that concludes our call."",
  ""In terms of the guidance raise that we had, I'd say that was primarily due to the acquisitions that we closed subsequent to our last quarter's call."",
  ""So, we did have those acquisitions close and we added those to the guide."",
  ""I'd say we had a little bit better beat than our internal expectations and rolled that through into the guide as well."",
  ""And, obviously, you heard Steve's comments about the outlook and how we're feeling about the balance of the year gave us confidence to roll that through."",
  ""And then a little bit more, given the optimism on the end markets."",
  ""In terms of 2025, I think you're right on."",
  ""That's how we're thinking about it at this point."",
  ""Obviously, still early yet, but definitely looking forward a more typical year as we think about the end markets."",
  ""We think those are going to be slightly positive as we sit here today, good execution across the board on our initiatives that we've had this year, and feel like that's going to play into next year really, really nicely into that 2 to 4 points of above-market growth."",
  ""From a, I'd say an operating margin standpoint, fully expect to deliver on our commitment of adding 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin next year."",
  ""We've got some good momentum."",
  ""You saw us increase gross margins sequentially from Q2 to Q3."",
  ""And in addition to that, our SG&A rate improved sequentially from last quarter as well."",
  ""So, got some good momentum here going into the fourth quarter."",
  ""And like what we're seeing so far for the end markets in 2025."",
  ""In terms of the quarter, I would say it came in slightly better than our internal expectations."",
  ""Obviously, we had a decent beat to consensus on the top line and EBITDA margins, but we were expecting a better construction cycle here in Q3 relative to the impacts that we saw in Q2."",
  ""So, we did see some of that release into Q3, but it really got us back on trends that we were expecting and really were expecting to see throughout that quarter."",
  ""Gross margins came in nicely like I mentioned sequentially."",
  ""We were expecting some improvement there."",
  ""But that probably came in slightly better as well than what we're expecting."",
  ""So, overall, we were pleased to see us get back on the trend lines that we expected to be for really this year outside of the impacts that we saw in Q2."",
  ""Some of those projects – I'd say some of those projects have all released through."",
  ""There's probably a little bit more that we would expect in Q4, just depending on how late the construction season goes, in particular in some of these northern geographies."",
  ""So, overall, feel good with the performance in the quarter."",
  ""Yeah, I'd say overall, as we sit here today, we're expecting really a neutral impact in 2025, with the pricing."",
  ""I'd say no really significant contributors, either positively or negatively for 2025."",
  ""I'd say on the steel pipe side, we've seen that decline throughout 2024."",
  ""We do think it kind of bottomed out in Q3."",
  ""We started to see some momentum there, but we will have a headwind there as we get into the early part of the year."",
  ""PVC, again, less than 15% of our business, but has been relatively stable here throughout 2024."",
  ""And no real expectations for significant movement going into next year as we sit here today."",
  ""So, hopefully, we got the steel pipe side and the fire protection behind us."",
  ""And we're seeing some other good information coming in from various suppliers, good trends in a lot of these product categories."",
  ""So, that's kind of what leads us to believe at this point that neutral is a good estimate at this point for 2025."",
  ""In terms of the sequential improvement in gross margins, you saw we increased about 20 basis points since last quarter."",
  ""I'd say in terms of the ranking there, the first and foremost was just strategic sourcing and some of the optimization work that we've done there made a lot of really good progress on that throughout the year."",
  ""Then probably rank private label second, was a good contributor, and we've continued to make really good progress there."",
  ""I'd say we're kind of in the range of 2% to 3% of COGS on private label."",
  ""We've advanced that pretty well since we updated that figure last, and we'll be providing some more detail on that in terms of how we wrap up the full-year from a private label standpoint and, obviously, expectations about where we think that can go."",
  ""But, I'd rank them there, sourcing, optimization and private label, no real acquisition contribution sequentially there."",
  ""We did have some benefit year-over-year from an M&A standpoint at gross margins, but not a significant contributor sequentially."",
  ""I'll try to tick through those."",
  ""But on the IIJA funding, we still haven't seen a majority of that get down to the state level."",
  ""The federal allocation there really needs to be pushed down and allocated into those state revolving funds."",
  ""And then that's when local municipalities can go in and access those funds."",
  ""So, there's still a lot more funding there to be allocated."",
  ""But like Steve mentioned early, we are really optimistic with some of the movement we saw in particular this quarter with a lot more projects being bid and applied for funding there."",
  ""So, I do expect that momentum to continue and be a tailwind for us as we get into 2025."",
  ""As it relates to megaprojects and data centers, I'd say we participate significantly in those."",
  ""We've seen a lot of those projects all around the country."",
  ""We participate in a lot of ways initially with all of the infrastructure needed for water, sewer, storm drainage, there's a pretty significant amount of infrastructure that goes in."",
  ""And then in some cases, there's fire protection product that's addressable us in those facilities."",
  ""But, you know, that's been a good area of momentum that we've seen in the non-resi space, and we'll continue to participate in those."",
  ""We continue to see more and more of those pop up throughout the country and we're well-positioned to capture that growth."",
  ""Pat, our best sense of that in terms of how much has been allocated, it's roughly about a third of it at this point."",
  ""So, still a lot of room there for additional funding growth."",
  ""Yeah, Joe, you're pretty, pretty close on that in terms of the mid – I'd say mid-single-digit volume growth for the quarter."",
  ""I'd say expectations that we've got embedded in the guide for Q4, obviously, it's a much more of a seasonal quarter for us."",
  ""So, I'd say more in the like – kind of call it neutral to slightly positive volumes in the fourth quarter."",
  ""And then, obviously, depending on the seasonal impacts that we see, that could move around a little bit."",
  ""The 53rd week, that'll be worth somewhere in the 6 to 8 points of revenue growth in the quarter."",
  ""So, get a little extra benefit there with the extra week."",
  ""In terms of the regions, I would say, the area that we were impacted by last quarter was really up and down through the central part of the US."",
  ""And in the third quarter, we definitely saw construction resume in that area."",
  ""So, that was really good to see for those parts of the country where they weren't able to complete a lot of that underground construction in Q2."",
  ""So, we did see that come back nicely."",
  ""I'd say municipal also rebounded."",
  ""We were pleased to see some of the starts get back online with the activity that we were expecting."",
  ""It was a little tricky for us to call that last quarter and we're really pleased with how that came in in the third quarter."",
  ""Really resi and non-resi, I'd say, both kind of came in fairly stable and in line with what our expectations were."",
  ""So, those are the priority areas that I'd highlight and call out."",
  ""In terms of leverage, we're going to continue to maintain a conservative balance sheet with pretty significant liquidity throughout."",
  ""We're obviously expecting to generate pretty good amount, right, over $250 million of cash in the fourth quarter."",
  ""So, I believe we'll have ample capacity to continue on our M&A strategy, continue a balanced approach to capital allocation, with potential share repurchases and that sort of thing, while maintaining leverage in a very reasonable line."",
  ""And we've laid out a target somewhere 1.5 to 3 turns for debt leverage and very confident we're going to stay within that that guidance that we have put out."",
  ""In terms of the ramp on greenfields, we're typically, I would say, just from an earnings perspective, we're breaking even within the first year."",
  ""And we're trying to ramp revenue to get to a typical branch size somewhere usually in years three to five."",
  ""So, that does take a little bit of time there to get mature in a market, but something we're very experienced, and we've got a great track record for rolling those out."",
  ""In terms of the pace, it's really dependent upon various factors."",
  ""So, we don't necessarily set a target for greenfields, but it's definitely a contributor when we talk about 2 to 4 points above-market growth."",
  ""It's been a contributor there and it'll continue to be a contributor as we move forward."",
  ""So, you should expect to see continued announcements as we open up in new locations."",
  ""Yeah, Matthew, in terms of the fourth quarter, you're correct that we expect about sequential gross margins into the fourth quarter."",
  ""From an SG&A perspective, we'll lose a little bit of a leverage into the – in the fourth quarter with the seasonal ramp down in sales."",
  ""So, the SG&A rate will be a little higher into the fourth quarter, which is typical for us."",
  ""As you think about 2025, we're very committed to the 30 to 50 basis points of operating margin improvement."",
  ""Now, that's going to come from a couple of different areas."",
  ""One, obviously potentially gross margins and then SG&A productivity."",
  ""And I'd expect that we'll be in a good position to expand both of those as we go into 2025."",
  ""So, I – feel really good that we're going to get that productivity out of SG&A and continue to work on our gross margin initiatives that we've laid out."",
  ""We grouped multifamily into non-residential primarily because we do a lot of other commercial work as well."",
  ""And it fits a little better into that bucket for us."",
  ""But it's, I'd say, less than 5% of our sales fit into that multifamily."",
  ""We do some of the – obviously the water, sewer, storm drainage around those facilities and then usually there's quite a bit of fire protection component in those types of projects."",
  ""So, that's really the – what makes up the majority of that participation in that end market."",
  ""Well, we think sequentially, it was obviously a much better construction quarter."",
  ""So, we got back on to the trend lines that we were expecting to have for Q3."",
  ""In terms of the projects, it's always difficult to tell exactly, you know, did any of those bump ahead of other projects."",
  ""But we do feel like a majority of that was – that we achieved a lot of that in the quarter."",
  ""There's probably some more to come yet in Q4, or that would get pushed into 2025."",
  ""But I – think about it sequentially, it was an improvement from Q2."",
  ""As you think about the benefit of it year-over-year, Q3 last year was a decent construction quarter."",
  ""Generally, the weather was fine."",
  ""So, really not as much year-over-year benefit, but obviously helped us sequentially from Q2.""

  ""Our relentless pursuit of operational excellence is translating into positive results as we align our business for growth and manage our operating expenses."",
  ""We finished the quarter with revenue of $100 million, exceeding our guidance range of $85 million to $95 million."",
  ""Non-GAAP gross margins remained steady at 26%, and inventory was slightly lower than it was in the second quarter."",
  ""Operating expenses were also down at $59 million compared to $66 million in the second quarter."",
  ""In the quarter, we reduced our cash consumption to $24 million, which is down 64% from Q1 of this year."",
  ""We continued to manage our cash with extreme rigor."",
  ""The third quarter was notable for the expansion of our work with automotive manufacturers and partners."",
  ""We completed a project for General Motors, deploying our software for a new use case with a major fast charging network in the USA."",
  ""We extended our footprint at US ports, doing a sizable deal with the Port of Stockton in California."",
  ""We recently joined forces with SIXT USA, a leading provider of premium mobility services."",
  ""SIXT and ChargePoint will be working together to test ChargePoint solutions at Select SIXT car rental locations in US markets with high EV adoption rates."",
  ""With our partner, Energy Efficiency Pros, we did a large installation for The recent US election is likely on many of your minds, but ChargePoint currently does not see any dramatic changes on the horizon that we expect will materially impact our business."",
  ""We have established our market leadership over 17 years amidst changing political environments, and we will continue to drive the secular shift towards clean transportation."",
  ""Significant investments have been made across sectors to prepare for this shift."",
  ""We believe electric vehicles are far superior to their internal combustion counterparts and we do not predict any reversals on the road to electrification."",
  ""Last quarter, I mentioned green shoots in demand and we continue to see encouraging signs in the market."",
  ""Charging network operators have been reporting an upswing in charger utilization, a trend we are also seeing at ChargePoint."",
  ""This is good for the industry as a whole and good for ChargePoint as a supplier of software and hardware to the aforementioned networks."",
  ""This all demonstrates the need for more infrastructure, with our utilization outpacing our port growth yet again in the third quarter."",
  ""This pressure has prompted customer inquiries about incremental chargers."",
  ""The utilization pressure is the result of more EVs on the road."",
  ""The US saw record EV sales in the third quarter, up 11% year-over-year, according to Cox Automotive."",
  ""It was also a record quarter for the EV market share in the US, considering the stable and sustainable growth pattern I mentioned in our last ."",
  ""In terms of our own growth, our managed port count now exceeds 329,000, representing 20% more active ports in the field year-over-year."",
  ""We count 80% of the Fortune 50 companies as customers, and we estimate we have avoided the consumption of nearly 500 million gallons of gasoline."",
  ""In our last call, I introduced ChargePoint's three-year strategic plan."",
  ""This plan remains anchored upon our four cornerstones of a class-leading software platform, hardware innovation, delivering a world-class driver experience and operational excellence."",
  ""Year one goals included finalizing our leadership team, revising our product roadmap, rightsizing and ensuring operational excellence."",
  ""Three quarters into this fiscal year, we have accomplished all of this with the hiring of our new CRO, David Vice, being a recent highlight."",
  ""David joined us in September and he is aligning the sales organization to drive growth."",
  ""Priority for year two of the strategic plan is the rollout of our next generation software and hardware products."",
  ""Our next-generation software aggregates Year three of the plan is when we expect to reap the full benefits of a top performing organization, a next-gen portfolio of innovative software and hardware products, and operational excellence."",
  ""To ensure a world-class driver experience, we are continuously improving network reliability."",
  ""Last quarter, we deployed an AI solution to make it easy for drivers to report problem stations with detailed and actionable information."",
  ""We knew it would resonate with our drivers, but the results have far exceeded our expectations."",
  ""Within the first 10 weeks, we received actionable reports that enabled us to result in nearly half of all reported issues across thousands of stations more efficiently."",
  ""This tool is materially helping us improve station uptime and increase customer satisfaction."",
  ""We continue to focus on operational excellence."",
  ""Proof of this comes in the form of our third quarter results."",
  ""September sales and marketing focused reorg has opened the door for new ideas and approaches, and our CRO has been aligning the team for revenue growth and scalable processes."",
  ""The financial benefits of September's rightsizing became evident at the end of the quarter, and the additional benefits will materialize in the fourth quarter and beyond."",
  ""We are focused on driving revenue growth while carefully managing our operating expenses."",
  ""Excellence is also defined by outstanding customer support, and our support capabilities are now winning us deals over the competition."",
  ""In conclusion, we have accomplished the first year goals of our strategic plan and done so ahead of schedule."",
  ""Our Q3 revenue and improved OpEx are proof of this."",
  ""We are encouraged by the record EV sales in the industry, and we continue to see network utilization demonstrate the need for more charging infrastructure."",
  ""We are now concentrating on returning to growth and streamlining operations to continue on our path to positive non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, which is targeted for a quarter in fiscal year 2026."",
  ""I will now hand the call over to our CFO, Mansi."",
  ""This call is being webcast and can be accessed on the Investors section of our website at investors.chargepoint.com."",
  ""With me on today's call are Rick Wilmer, our Chief Executive Officer; and Mansi Khetani, our Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""This afternoon, we issued our press release announcing results for the quarter ended October 31, 2024, which can be found on our website."",
  ""We'd like to remind you that during the conference call, management will be making forward-looking statements, including our outlook for our fourth quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations."",
  ""These forward-looking statements apply as of today and we undertake no obligation to update these statements after the call."",
  ""For a more detailed description of certain factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on September 9, 2024, and our  posted today on our website and filed with the SEC on Form 8-K. Also, please note that we use certain non-GAAP financial measures on this call, which we have reconciled to GAAP in our  and for certain historical periods in the investor presentation posted on the Investors section of our website."",
  ""And finally, we'll be posting a transcript of this call to our Investor Relations website under the Quarterly Results section."",
  ""And with that, I'll turn the call over to Rick."",
  ""Revenue for the third quarter was $100 million, above our guidance range of $85 million to $95 million."",
  ""Network charging systems at $53 million accounted for 53% of third quarter revenue."",
  ""This was down 18% sequentially and down 29% year-on-year."",
  ""Subscription revenue at $36 million was 37% of total revenue, up 1% sequentially and up 19% year-on-year."",
  ""Subscriptions continue to demonstrate healthy growth."",
  ""Other revenue at $11 million was 10% of total revenue."",
  ""This was up 28% sequentially and up 81% year-on-year due to growth in net transaction fees for processing payments and one-time project revenue."",
  ""Turning to verticals, which we report from a billings perspective, third quarter billings percentages were: commercial, 61%; fleet, 15%; residential, 18%; and other, 6%."",
  ""The commercial segment has normalized as a percentage of total billings after several large Express Plus DC shipments in the second quarter."",
  ""Fleet remained stable, but the pushouts we outlined last quarter due to permitting and construction delays persist."",
  ""Note that this is business that we expect to capture in future quarters."",
  ""Our highly-rated home charger, the Home Flex, continue to be a bestseller and contributed a strong share of billings in the third quarter."",
  ""From a geographic perspective, North America made up 83% of third quarter revenue and Europe was at 17%."",
  ""Europe remains challenging for the entire EV sector amidst policy and incentive uncertainties."",
  ""Non-GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 26%, consistent with the second quarter."",
  ""Gross margin improved by 44 percentage points as compared to the third quarter last year, a quarter that was impacted by an inventory impairment charge."",
  ""Non-GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $59 million, down 12% sequentially and down 28% from $81 million in the third quarter last year."",
  ""In September, we reduced our non-GAAP operating expenses by an estimated $38 million on an annualized basis."",
  ""In the third quarter, we saw a partial impact of the September restructuring."",
  ""The full impact on our run rate operating expense profile will be evident in the fourth quarter."",
  ""Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA loss for the third quarter was $29 million, a fourth consecutive quarter of improvement."",
  ""This compares to a loss of $34 million in the second quarter and a loss of $97 million in Q3 of last year."",
  ""Stock-based compensation in the third quarter was $21 million, up from $19 million in the second quarter and down from $33 million year-on-year."",
  ""Our inventory balance decreased by $7 million in the third quarter from an all-time high in the second quarter."",
  ""As we continue to sell through finished goods on hand, this should release a significant amount of working capital and we expect to free up cash next year."",
  ""We ended the quarter with $220 million cash on hand."",
  ""We reduced net cash consumption to $24 million for the third quarter, which is down 64% from Q1 of this year and is lower than our adjusted EBITDA loss for the third quarter."",
  ""While we continue to rigorously focus on cash management, we have access to a $150 million revolving credit facility, which remains undrawn."",
  ""We have no debt maturities till 2028 and we have existing capacity on our ATM."",
  ""Turning to guidance, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue to be $95 million to $105 million."",
  ""While we are pleased with beating our guidance in the third quarter, we continue to be prudent in our forward guidance as a result of our recent improvements to the sales and marketing organization."",
  ""In conclusion, our Q3 was solid, with revenue beating our expectations."",
  ""As Rick outlined in his remarks, we have taken meaningful steps throughout this year to improve operations and have achieved more efficient cost structure."",
  ""This has improved our adjusted EBITDA each quarter this year and reduced our cash usage, a trend that we expect to continue as we progress towards profitability."",
  ""We believe the trough is behind us."",
  ""We are improving on all metrics within our control."",
  ""And with the recent reorganization of our sales structure, we are now well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunity ahead of us."",
  ""With that, I will turn the call back to the operator for questions.""
]","[
  ""Could you talk a little bit about the margin trajectory that you're expecting on the gross margin side?"",
  ""Obviously, you guys have adjusted some of the manufacturing, the component supply shift a little bit."",
  ""But just want to get a sense of how that's trended for you and how we should think about that on a multi-quarter basis."",
  ""And then, just in terms of the sales process, can you talk a little bit about the efficiency per head count that you're seeing with the sales team, as well as the win rate that you guys are seeing in terms of the bids and how that's flowing through the sales funnel?"",
  ""I wanted to come back to your comments that you're not expecting any material changes, I guess, with the incoming administration."",
  ""I think it's pretty well known that there's expectations around tariffs and potentially 30D tax credits going away."",
  ""But maybe, I guess on the tariff side and your cost structure, trying to get – I know you're working with partners in Asia."",
  ""If there were to be a tariff implemented, how should we think about the impacts to your, I guess, margin expectations?"",
  ""Would you flex any capacity back to North America?"",
  ""How should we think of – does this give you caution on how to think about the margin expansion in next year and beyond?"",
  ""And you commented earlier that Europe has been challenged."",
  ""We saw a lot of negative year-on-year growth trends for many of the countries."",
  ""France is pulling back in subsidies."",
  ""I guess I'm trying to get a sense for how you feel about the strategic rationale with Europe at this stage."",
  ""Would you consider divestment before the balance sheet as you're seeing your program unfolds, or I guess maybe sort of asking another way, how synergistic are the businesses at this stage?"",
  "" very much for taking the questions."",
  ""Rick and Mansi, you both alluded to your view that the business has troughed and you see some That's helpful."",
  ""And my follow-up question, I think more for you, Mansi, you spoke about some additional cost reductions you expect to flow through this coming quarter."",
  ""Can you be a bit more specific around what to expect around OpEx or OpEx savings and how sustainable that lower run rate may be in the coming year?"",
  ""And I guess you just contextualize what that might mean."",
  ""To the extent there is downside to the business from the top line perspective, I understand that's not your expectation."",
  ""But if there were because of macroeconomic or policy changes, do you think ChargePoint could take more cost out or would that be hard to do given how much you've already done on that front?"",
  ""First question, just to round out the question on the backdrop, is it safe to say you're also not seeing any buyer hesitancy related to the new politics from any network customers or anything like that?"",
  ""Can you just give us a sense if there's been a reaction there?"",
  ""And then, I had a follow-up."",
  ""And then, if we could do just a maybe a little bit deeper dive on the gross margins, looking at it software versus hardware, are we thinking that the improvement for at least a couple more quarters is just more of a mix of software or do we start to see the hardware margins start to improve based on everything that you talked about so far?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Mansi, you talked about continuing to free up working capital as you sell down inventory."",
  ""I'm just wondering, is there any kind of obsolescence or price risk that you face as that – as you – as the timeline to bring that inventory expands?"",
  ""And then, I have one other question."",
  ""Yeah, sorry, that's a much more eloquent way of putting it."",
  ""And then, my other question is just looking at the cash OpEx burn, you obviously – you all have had a lot of luck bringing that down and continue to work on it."",
  ""Can we – do you pretty much have that where you wanted at this point, the idea being that if improvement comes from top line growth?"",
  ""Can we think about it that way?"",
  ""Maybe I didn't state the question quite correctly as the cash OpEx."",
  ""Can we think about that as basically being flat on the non-GAAP OpEx going forward?"",
  ""No, it's my bad, sorry."",
  ""I just wanted to follow-up on the on the longer-term outlook for 2026 and the positive EBITDA comment."",
  ""Could you just maybe, I guess, walk us through some of the levers that you all have to achieve that."",
  ""Is that really just a function of revenue growth or are there additional levers that you all have to, I guess, manage on your side outside of the kind of macro demand environment?"",
  ""That was it for me."",
  ""Rick, I just want to make sure I follow something you said."",
  ""A year or two, which is next year, you're going to have next-generation software and next-generation hardware."",
  ""Does the next-generation software work on hardware in the field?"",
  ""And then, I just want to understand the timing of the inventory drawdown and the introduction of next-generation hardware better."",
  ""I'm just curious what the timing."",
  ""You talked about next-generation hardware coming next year, but you've got this inventory build right now that you're looking to draw down."",
  ""I just – it seems like they're both kind of landing at the same time, if I have that right, or I just want to understand the timing of the drawdown versus building inventory, next-generation hardware."",
  ""And then, can you just touch on the Essential cloud plan that you released, that you talked about at the end of October?"",
  ""This – does this sort of put you on the path to being an owner operator – or quasi-owner operator since you're taking revenue from the drivers now, and this allows customers to have a lower monthly cost burden?"",
  ""I just want to understand the path that you're on or if this is just more of a special project for multifamily dwelling-type buyers."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""Rick, was curious if you can maybe give us a bit more color on this software you deployed for GM, a new use case with a major fast charging network in the US."",
  ""Just curious if you could maybe talk a little bit about that, and if you outlined or identified additional use cases for this new software, I guess."",
  ""And then, just as a follow-up, Mansi, you mentioned gross margin next year will ultimately also depend on mix."",
  ""So, I was curious if you can maybe level set a bit and give us an update or maybe rank within the portfolio, like Level 2's CP6000 now, the more margin-rich product versus CT4000 or CPF50, the new one."",
  ""And similarly, on the DC side, which express offering would be the most margin-rich at this point?"",
  ""It's Pat Ouellette on for Stephen Gengaro."",
  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""You'd been optimistic about some green shoot potentials next year and seeing your customers significantly expand their deployment plans."",
  ""I'm curious if expectations have shifted one way or another."",
  ""And then, any comments you could provide specifically on the fleet side?"",
  ""And then, looking into next year with the Asia manufacturing, coupled with potential increasing higher margin subscription revenue, could you talk about any associated  for that."",
  ""Just like any thoughts on a more competitive market for product sales impacting margin?"",
  ""I wanted to ask for a little bit more color around the sort of base assumptions in your forecast for growth and the return to positive EBITDA, or I should say the achievement of positive EBITDA, because it'll be a very important milestone."",
  ""Can you maybe give us color on the relative contribution you expect from new products in verticals that you don't already serve versus new products in – that are updates, as you refer to them multiple times on the call, versus organic growth in a positive trajectory for products that you already have established channels and relationships and customers for?"",
  ""And then, just as a follow-up question, we're hearing a lot of interest about sort of an accelerated changeover to Excellent."",
  ""Well, congratulations on the progress bringing down cost."",
  ""I'll hop back in the queue."",
  "", Colin, for that question."",
  ""I've really been pleased with our new leader, David Vice, and the impact he made in quite frankly a quarter that was disrupted through the restructuring that we executed during the quarter."",
  ""But the progress we've made across a variety of initiatives in the sales and marketing area yielded results in Q3, and I'm optimistic about the continued impact those changes will have going forward."",
  ""They include things like areas of focus on certain segments by geography, clarifying roles and responsibilities within the sales and marketing organization, upleveling sales skills, standardizing processes for moving deals through the deal stages, as we take those through to win in execution, a focus on our partner program, our channel partner program, improving that along with the way we generate interest in the company's products from a marketing perspective and process that through into the sales organization for execution."",
  ""It's speculative exactly what's going to happen based on what we know so far, Bill."",
  ""But we don't manufacture in China, for one thing."",
  ""We also have manufacturing operations up and running in the United States, and we've had those for a long time."",
  ""So if it became cost effective to shift more production to the US, that's clearly an option that we have available to us right now today if we need to do that."",
  ""We're committed to Europe The other thing I'll tell you is that the focus on sales and marketing that we executed in Q3 was very North America-centric, and we're now going to turn a lot of that focus to Europe and have no reason to expect similar improvements like those we saw in North America."",
  ""I think the other thing that gives us confidence is the continued diversity of EV selection that rolls into the market from the auto OEMs."",
  ""I think that we are firmly convinced and probably biased that EVs are far superior to internal combustion engine cars as a product in general."",
  ""And knowing that we now have a broader selection of vehicles coming, both in terms of price point, size, shape, form, class, I think that's going to continue to drive EV adoption."",
  ""So, I'm very optimistic that a broader selection of cars is going – has helped move things forward."",
  ""No, we've seen literally zero change in terms of buying behavior from our customer base."",
  ""So, let me take the first part of that, Chris."",
  ""So, all of our software is absolutely backward compatible with all of our prior products, and we'll obviously support all the new products that we'll be introducing."",
  ""Furthermore, we have talked many times about the fact that we're – our software platform is open."",
  ""So, we manage a lot of third-party hardware with our software that's not even ours."",
  ""So, we're fully compatible across the board with prior generation, next generation and third-party hardware."",
  ""What was the second part again, Chris?"",
  ""So, we're – we are very diligent about aligning supply with demand."",
  ""And we're confident that as we introduce new products, the products – if they do replace a prior product and are not something new, that will manage that transition effectively to avoid any significant obsolescence of an older product."",
  ""And we've looked at that very carefully and are confident that we're in fine shape in that regard."",
  ""No, good question and  for asking that question."",
  ""It definitely does not put us into the position of being an energy seller."",
  ""That is not our business."",
  ""That would put us in competition with our customers and we have no plans to do anything like that."",
  ""So, this is really an easy to buy or an easy to consume way to take care of your licensing requirements to ChargePoint."",
  ""So rather than every year, get a renewal notice for your software or your enhanced warranty services, we just deduct that from your driver revenue until the amount you owe us for those services are paid and then you cover the rest."",
  ""So, you forego the hassle of getting renewal notices as a customer and having to get a quote from us and pay the invoice."",
  ""It also improves our internal efficiency because we don't have to do all that renewal work on an annual or however long the term of the license is."",
  ""We won't go into too many details about that."",
  ""It was a significant project and it also applies to things we can do with other auto OEMs."",
  ""I think in general, across all segments, especially in North America, we're seeing demand that is pleasing to us."",
  ""And again, with the improvements we've made in terms of sales and marketing execution, we're executing on that demand better."",
  ""So, it seems to be pretty evenly spread across all segments, at least in North America, again, with a bit slower market growth in Europe at the moment."",
  ""And in fleet, in particular, I think we've got some exciting opportunities there, and those tend to come in large deal chunks."",
  ""And we've got some pretty exciting things there that we're working on that I'm looking forward to next year."",
  ""The competitive landscape, it moves around, but in terms of the overall strength of the competition, it doesn't seem to change on an overall basis in an appreciable way."",
  ""The one thing we have noticed is that all the investments we've made in our support organization, the example of our AI picture to resolution feature that we rolled out last quarter, those are starting to make a real differentiating factor for us."",
  ""We're winning deals on our ability to support our customers and make sure their networks stay up and stay reliable."",
  ""Nice to hear from you."",
  ""I think next year, the new products that serve new use cases and categories will not contribute much."",
  ""Those are really going to be developed and launched as we move through the year and start to show significant financial benefit in the following year."",
  ""So, the majority of the revenue in the upcoming fiscal year, our fiscal 2026, which starts on February 1, will come from our existing portfolio."",
  ""We're in good shape there."",
  ""We've got our Omni Port solution that we've publicly announced that's going to begin shipping here very soon."",
  ""And our parking lot is full of them and they are used frequently, and it's a really elegant solution that basically makes the connector on your car irrelevant."",
  ""You can come charge at a ChargePoint station no matter what you have, as long as you – that you've got the Omni Port solution installed."",
  ""And we do expect customers toYeah."",
  ""I can take that one."",
  ""So from a gross margin perspective, we ended with – at 26% in Q3."",
  ""I expect it to be flattish to maybe improve slightly in Q4."",
  ""But the majority of the improvement or meaningful margin improvement will be realized next year as we sell through our existing inventory and really start seeing the benefits of our Asia manufacturing."",
  ""And specifically, Mark, in terms of where we see revenue growth coming from, there are a number of green shoots."",
  ""One is closing deals that have already been pushed out from this year."",
  ""In many cases, we're getting indications of potential expansions as well."",
  ""On the fleet side, there are large deals that we've already won, specifically in the eBus space that are expected to ship next year."",
  ""On the commercial side, there are government and NEVI-related wins that we've already booked that are expected to ship next year, as well as auto dealership deals we've won."",
  ""Residential has been a strong sector for us as well, and we have forecast of growth in volumes from our channel partners."",
  ""And then, of course, there is a continued increase in subscription revenue."",
  ""So, all of this will contribute to a growth in revenue for us specifically next year."",
  ""So overall, on the OpEx side, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we took out $38 million of an annualized OpEx on a non-GAAP basis to our September restructuring."",
  ""So, we saw to – that averages to about $9-ish million a quarter."",
  ""And we saw two-thirds of that impact coming through in Q3, and in Q4, we'll see the full quarter impact."",
  ""So we're not expecting anything additional, in addition to the restructuring that we did in September for the Q4 operating expenses run rate."",
  ""This run rate will continue through next year."",
  ""Obviously, there would be some investments that we will make in certain areas of the business where we see it prudent to do so and where we get direct revenue benefits."",
  ""But other than that, I think this is a pretty good run rate going into next year."",
  ""And then, to the second part of your question in terms of overall – there is – we are always looking at OpEx to see – to find efficiencies that are so many areas like P&E, there are facilities, spend that are – there's software spend, external consulting services, et cetera, that we can and will continuously look at to see where we can get more synergies from."",
  ""So, hardware margins will improve as well."",
  ""As you saw in this quarter, hardware margins were lower than last quarter."",
  ""It was mostly due to some incremental freight charges for some raw materials that were moved from US-based CMs to Asia, more and more like a one-time impact."",
  ""So, hardware margins should continue to go up steadily."",
  ""Hardware margins also kind of are influenced by final mix of product."",
  ""So depending on where the mix lands, that will cause some fluctuations."",
  ""But overall, like I said before, the more meaningful improvements in hardware margin will come around middle of next year when we actually start seeing benefit of our Asia manufacturing."",
  ""So Joseph, just to clarify, are you saying is there any obsolescence risk in our inventory?"",
  ""So no, I mean, pretty much all the product that we have on our inventory right now is products that we're actively selling."",
  ""We did, as you can remember, take some write-offs earlier, maybe three, four quarters ago, on the old generation products."",
  ""So now, all of our inventory is of goods that we're currently selling and we expect to sell those through over a period of time."",
  ""There is always some write-offs each quarter."",
  ""We have variances in terms of maybe changes in standard costs or maybe some really old E&O stuff, which is small."",
  ""It's kind of normal course of business that we will continue to do every quarter."",
  ""So on cash, we were really pleased with our cash usage for this quarter."",
  ""As we mentioned, we brought it down to $24 million, which is significantly lower than the $66 million in Q1 and $50 million in Q2."",
  ""The main reason was – well, there were two reasons."",
  ""One is we brought OpEx down, so that directly impacts our cash usage, and the second one was inventory."",
  ""This quarter, we actually managed to bring inventory down."",
  ""Last couple of quarters, we've been building inventory balance."",
  ""And so, we've been investing in using up our cash to bring that inventory onboard."",
  ""This quarter, we saw a reversal of that trend and we actually freed up cash and reduced our cash burn because of that."",
  ""And as what we've been saying, we should see that accelerate through next year as we bring down inventory in an even more meaningful way."",
  ""Generally speaking, because of the business that we're in, we are capital light."",
  ""We don't have any CapEx or very, very little CapEx."",
  ""Our cash burn should mirror our EBITDA loss pretty closely."",
  ""And that's basically my goal."",
  ""That's what we want to get to."",
  ""We did that this quarter."",
  ""Actually, this quarter, our cash burn was even slightly lower than our EBITDA loss."",
  ""We'll continue to see that trajectory going forward."",
  ""And as we get closer to EBITDA breakeven, we should get to cash flow breakeven."",
  ""Now, we could get to cash flow breakeven a little bit earlier if we see more release of working capital because of reduced inventory."",
  ""So Q4... Yeah, Q4, we'll see the full benefit of the September restructuring."",
  ""So, it should be better than Q3."",
  ""And then after that, we think it's more or less in a good place."",
  ""We're not guiding as of now to next year's OpEx."",
  ""But for Q4, you should see an improvement versus Q3."",
  ""So as you saw this year, we've made significant progress towards our – getting to adjusted EBITDA positive by managing our cost structure."",
  ""So, that helps on the OpEx side pretty significantly."",
  ""The two levers that will get us there are revenue growth and gross margin improvement, right?"",
  ""So revenue growth, as I laid out, there are a number of green shoots that we're seeing that gives us confidence in that – in revenue growing next year."",
  ""And then on the gross margin side, as we start seeing benefits of Asia manufacturing next year, we should see that trending up as well."",
  ""So, we will see a combination of all of those three factors getting us there."",
  ""So, we're signing both CT4000, which is our legacy AC product, as well as the CT6000, which is a more premium product, and both are margin-rich, all of our AC portfolio is margin rich."",
  ""And on the DC side is – with the Asia manufacturing coming onboard, that will help the DC margins more significantly."",
  ""So, I'll take the first part regarding margin expansion next year."",
  ""Yes, you're correct, we do expect margin to expand next year."",
  ""We'll start seeing it happen around middle of next year."",
  ""And you are also correct, both hardware and subscription margins should expand, hardware because of the Asia manufacturing coming onboard, and then subscription margins expanding because we will continue to see a larger size of subscription revenue in overall revenue, as well as more efficiencies and economies of scale."",
  ""What is the – what was the second part, sorry, of your question?""

  ""The expansion of our One Earth Energy ethanol facility to 175 million gallons per year of production is estimated to be complete by the middle of 2025."",
  ""Currently, the electric interconnection from our local utility is moving ahead and should be complete by first quarter of 2025."",
  ""The timeline for completion of the ethanol production expansion has been extended from our previous target to the middle of 2025, due to delays recently communicated by one of our equipment suppliers for delivery of several necessary components."",
  ""After completion of the expansion and emission certification, we then expect to begin the plan further permitting of the One Earth ethanol facility to allow it to produce 200 million gallons per year."",
  ""As I have said before, the regulatory steps receiving an additional permit is the only step necessary to allow for the expanded capacity from 175 million to 200 million gallons as no major additional construction or capital spending is expected."",
  ""The expansion will give REX additional earnings power, allow us to sell more product from our highly efficient consolidated plant in Gibson City."",
  ""We expect that the expansion will provide even greater benefit to shareholders as well as support our ability to self-fund ongoing and future growth project."",
  ""As Stuart previously said, the carbon capture and compression portion of our One Earth Energy project in Gibson City, Illinois, is substantially complete."",
  ""We're excited about reaching this milestone, and we are looking forward to other portion of the project."",
  ""Just add with the expansion of our ethanol operation at the One Earth site, further work and testing in the capture and compression facilities are subject to completion of the utility interconnection to supply power to the project."",
  ""Beyond waiting for power, we continue to wait on several regulatory issues to be resolved."",
  ""Our permit application for Class VI injection wells are still under review with anticipated final approvals slated for July 2025, according to the EPA."",
  ""As a result of these challenges and as the capture and compression portion of the project are substantially complete, we plan to manage near-term major capital expenditure related to the CCS project in order to maintain budgetary flexibility and stay within project spend in light of that timeline for approval."",
  ""Given the new permitting reality, we are confident that pursuing the several ongoing portion of this project in this way is the right path."",
  ""As of quarter end, we have invested approximately $103 million into the One Earth carbon capture project and ethanol production capacity expansion combined."",
  ""Spending for the carbon capture and sequestration project stood at $52.9 million as of third quarter end, while expenditure on the ethanol expansion stood at $50.2 million as of the same date."",
  ""This is compared to total combined budgeted amount of $165 million to $175 million for both the CCS project and ethanol production expansion at Gibson City."",
  ""I would like to hand the call to our CFO, Doug Bruggeman, to discuss our operational and financial results."",
  ""I would now like to discuss how we see the end of the fiscal year shaping up."",
  ""As Stuart stated earlier, our plants continue to run with positive earnings into the fourth quarter, but not at the level of last year's fourth quarter."",
  ""Corn input prices have improved compared to year ago."",
  ""And given the bumper crop of corn in the Midwest, we expect adequate supply for our plants for this growing season."",
  ""As we have mentioned before, we do see sporadic dynamics for ethanol pricing for the export market."",
  ""Ethanol exports through the first nine months of the calendar year were approximately 33% higher than at the same point in calendar 2023 according to the US Energy Information Administration."",
  ""This level returns US exports to their pre-pandemic levels and puts the US on pace to exceed 2018 export volumes."",
  ""Currently, the all-time high year for export."",
  ""Looking ahead to 2025, we are particularly excited about the completion of our ethanol production expansion and anticipated increase in profitability this will allow for."",
  ""We will still expect approval of our Class VI permit from the EPA in the near term and to continue making progress on our CCS facility, which we expect would bring additional profitability once in operation."",
  ""Looking further down the road, the projects we are working on today are laying the groundwork for further potential growth into sustainable aviation fuel and third-party carbon sequestration."",
  ""We're excited about the future as we grow organically and are confident in our team's ability to rise to the challenges at every turn."",
  ""Now, I would like to open things up to questions."",
  ""With me on our call today are Stuart Rose, REX Executive Chairman; and Zafar Rizvi, the REX CEO."",
  ""We'll get to our presentation and comments momentarily as well as your questions."",
  ""But first, I will review the Safe Harbor disclosure."",
  ""In addition to historical facts or statements of current conditions, today's conference call contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Such forward-looking statements reflect the company's current expectations and beliefs, but are not guarantees of future performance."",
  ""As such, actual results may vary materially from expectations."",
  ""The risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements are described in today's news announcement and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. REX American Resources assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements."",
  ""I'd now like to turn the call over to our Executive Chairman, Stuart Rose."",
  ""During the third quarter, REX American Resources continued our progress on our three goals for 2024, setting the company up for success well into the future."",
  ""As a reminder, these goals were to continue profitable operations to complete the construction phase of our One Earth Energy carbon capture and compression facility and to complete the capacity expansion of our One Earth Energy ethanol production facility to 175 million gallons per year and move toward the planned further permitting of the facility to 200 million gallons per year."",
  ""To the first goal, we exceeded the mark."",
  ""The third quarter was REX American Resources' second most profitable quarter in the company's history behind only the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Our net income per share of $1.38 was an improvement of 97% over the second quarter of 2024, principally reflecting better corn pricing."",
  ""Gross margin improved over the third quarter of 2023 by 1%, despite a 21% reduction in product revenue."",
  ""As we have consistently said, we believe REX's facilities and personnel are among the best in the industry, which they proved quarter-after-quarter through their attention to detail and awareness of the markets."",
  ""The focus on lean and efficient operations in our core ethanol business, we believe, will serve as a basis for future increases in profit levels once our One Earth plant expansion is up and running next year."",
  ""It is this part of the business that has allowed REX to grow substantially debt-free, maintain strategic freedom, and move forward independently with additive growth projects."",
  ""As we always do, I want to say  to our team for their efforts this quarter and every day."",
  ""And the second goal to complete construction of the capture and compression portion of our One Earth Energy CCS project in Gibson City, Illinois, we have substantially realized this goal."",
  ""I'll let Zafar Rizvi, our CEO, discuss the specifics with regard to the remainder of this project later in the call."",
  ""Our third goal was to complete construction of the One Earth ethanol production capacity expansion to 175 million gallons per year to prepare for further permitting and production levels of 200 million gallons per year."",
  ""Right now, we estimate that the facility is on track for completion in the middle of 2025 based upon delays and delivery timelines for certain necessary components."",
  ""As you can see, our efforts to support near- and long-term growth moving forward successfully."",
  ""At the current time, the fourth quarter continues to be profitable, but trails last year's fourth quarter, which was a historically very strong quarter."",
  ""I'd now like to turn things over to our CEO, Zafar Rizvi, to give further updates on our major projects."",
  ""I'll begin with our operational results."",
  ""REX's ethanol sales volume during the third quarter 2024 were 75.5 million gallons, an increase of approximately 3% versus third quarter 2023 sales volume of 73.2 million gallons."",
  ""Average selling price for our consolidated ethanol volume was $1.83 per gallon for the third quarter compared to $2.32 per gallon in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Dry distillers grain sales volume during the third quarter of 2024 totaled 170,116 tons, a 5% decrease over third quarter 2023 volumes."",
  ""Average selling price for the dry distiller grain was $147.14 per ton for the third quarter 2024 compared to $194.94 per ton in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Modified distiller grain sales volumes were 18,392 tons in the third quarter 2024 compared with approximately 13,500 tons in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The average selling price for modified distiller grain was $63 per ton for the third quarter versus $85.86 in the prior year third quarter."",
  ""Corn oil sales volume in the third quarter 2024 were approximately 23.4 million pounds compared to 24.1 million pounds sold in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The average selling price for REX's corn oil products was $0.44 per pound for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.61 per pound in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Gross profit for third quarter 2024 was $39.7 million versus gross profit of $39.3 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The 1% increase in gross profit was achieved despite lower average selling prices for all products, which were more than offset by lower corn and natural gas input prices."",
  ""Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $8.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 versus $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The increase was primarily due to railcar leasing cost increases and certain donations to local first responders related to the carbon capture at the One Earth facility."",
  ""Interest and other income totaled $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Prior year amounts included $900,000 of COVID-related grants from the USDA."",
  ""Income before taxes and non-controlling interest for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $39.5 million compared to $41.3 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Net income attributable to REX shareholders for the third quarter was $24.5 million compared to $26.1 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""On a per share diluted basis for the third quarter of 2024, this amounts to $1.38 per share of net income."",
  ""The second best results in the history of the company, only exceeded by net income generated in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""We ended the third quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $365.1 million compared with $378.7 million as of January 31, 2024."",
  ""The uses of cash during the first nine months of the fiscal year were primarily related to our ongoing construction projects at the One Earth Energy facility."",
  ""REX American also ended the quarter without any bank debt."",
  ""I'd now like to turn things back to Zafar.""
]","[
  ""Congratulations on the solid quarter."",
  ""I wanted to get your thoughts here."",
  ""There was just an article I saw from Reuters that was saying the Biden administration will finalize 45Z guidance ahead of the January inauguration."",
  ""So, I want to get your thinking as it relates to the growth initiatives on the expansion and on the Got it."",
  ""And then, you all have always been a very prudent allocators of capital, Stuart, Zafar, looking at the incoming, whatever you expect for the incoming policy landscape and recognizing that you've got a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet right now that saw a nice uptick from last quarter."",
  ""If you look at the areas of opportunity for you all in terms of deploying that cash, I think you noted managing cost on the CCUS side of things as you figure out kind of what things look like."",
  ""But where do you see the most attractive opportunities for allocating the cash at this point?"",
  ""I'll take the rest offline."",
  ""Yeah,  for taking the question."",
  ""Following up on the discussion you just had about kind of future federal policy."",
  ""It's probably going to be three months, six months before Congress moves forward with tax reform, which may well include some changes to the Inflation Reduction Act, for example, Section 45Q. Are you going to postpone any kind of decisions on the carbon capture project until you get clarity that 45Q will remain in place?"",
  ""Maybe a follow-up on the ethanol front."",
  ""You have a long history of operating ethanol plants, including, of course, under Trump's first term."",
  ""Can you just give some historical perspective on how the EPA went about setting the blending mandate between kind of 2017 and 2021 and how you managed around that?"",
  ""Yeah, I think the only hope, Jordan, I see because in Midwest is basically the farmers and corn growers."",
  ""And there's lot of support we see from farmers and corn growers because they are also looking for – to see how they can benefit from 45Z as a – crops which they plan to have use different method and no tail and others and they can get also benefit from 45Z. So, we certainly see some support from all these states."",
  ""And hopefully, that will make some difference when Trump administration will take over and able to convince that."",
  ""But on the other hand, the period is very short."",
  ""That was only 2025 to 2027."",
  ""And we see some movement to extend that period to 12 years."",
  ""But at this time, we have no really solid knowledge what's exactly going to happen."",
  ""And I think I'd add to that is, as you know, Jordan, that you have to be servicing by 2032."",
  ""And so, we have enough time – 2034 actually, 2034."",
  ""So, we have enough time to really to be in service before time expire."",
  ""But 45Z was only three years."",
  ""So that's the difference between 45Q and 45Z, that we can take advantage of 45Q. Yeah, I think I will add to that."",
  ""If you remember, we started this project in 2018."",
  ""At that time, there was no Inflation Reduction Act there."",
  ""And it was approximately $50 tax credit, and that tax credit was also gone through Trump administration during that."",
  ""So, I don't really see that there's going to be a major changes to 45Q. And also, you are aware of that several other facilities are already working on this 45Q carbon sequestration, including the project for $7 billion to $8 billion worth for the carbon pipeline."",
  ""So, these people have invested a lot of money on these projects and sudden changes will – probably will not be implemented because this pipeline – this project is already in pipeline and changes can happen, but I personally don't anticipate that there's going to be any changes in 45Q.Hi, Jordan."",
  ""My opinion – this is Stuart."",
  ""I'll answer first and Zafar can follow up."",
  ""But if – we also believe they won't finalize 45Z by the end of the term, and we don't know what the Trump administration will do, we don't know their feelings on the 45 period, Q or Z. And so, we remain wary of what they will do."",
  ""And in reality, it's going to be really hard to get 45Z without any regulations and without an EPA permit."",
  ""Right now, it's going to be really hard for us to benefit in the next two years from 45Z. So, hopefully, we can benefit at least get one year of 45Z, but it's going to be very difficult right now because they have not finalized the regulations, and we don't know what the new Trump administration is going to do."",
  ""One other thing, Jordan, at this time – Jordan, at this time, 45Q is in effect, and that's cut and dry at $85 a ton that has passed legislatively."",
  ""So, if nothing – if we don't get 45Z the way the law is written today, we would get 45Q which is $85 a ton, which would still make our project very profitable as long as I keep that."",
  ""Well, one thing we've always done, Jordan, as you know, when the stock drops – if the stock ever drops significantly, we are keen to buybacks."",
  ""We bought back probably more shares percentage wise than any other company I know."",
  ""The other thing is we always are looking for opportunities, whether it's new ethanol plants."",
  ""There are a few that we're looking at, but that doesn't mean anything when they're in the very, very preliminary stages and who knows if anything will happen."",
  ""Generally today, the prices people want is way above what we're willing to pay."",
  ""But that's always an opportunity."",
  ""And thirdly, we're not afraid to go into other things that are either related or sometimes even unrelated to our business that we think our management skills will work with."",
  ""We haven't done that in a while."",
  ""But as you know, we were retailers at one time and now we're ethanol producers."",
  ""So, we're very good at – if it comes to that of looking -- if we see great opportunities of jumping on those, if they become available."",
  ""At this point in time, Pavel, we don't – if 45Q goes away, this is only my -- what I would -- and again, this is not a board of directors decision, it's Stuart Rose talking."",
  ""But as far – we would continue on – we would continue on with carbon capture because we'll get a greater -- if no one else is doing carbon capture, we're doing and we'll get a much greater price for -- I believe we'll get a much greater price for ethanol."",
  ""And I believe there'll still be a market to sell our credits to companies that want to become carbon neutral."",
  ""So, I don't think that we would end our project if there was – and we don't – at this point in time, we don't expect them to end 45, but anything is possible with the Trump administration, and we're well aware of that."",
  ""But my personal opinion, and it's only my personal opinion, would be we would continue on with the project."",
  ""And I think it would still be a good project."",
  ""We wouldn't get government help."",
  ""But there's definitely a market for low carbon jet fuel, and I can go on in California, a few places."",
  ""There's a good market for low-carbon ethanol, and we would be one of the few producers."",
  ""So, my personal opinion would be to continue on with that."",
  ""Zafar, do you want to add anything."",
  ""At that time, Pavel, I believe it was legislatively set, and there were a number of gallons that were – in the law that were – the IFRS required."",
  ""Nowadays, I believe that the EPA can set that level wherever they want, and that could be an issue going forward."",
  ""But again, if they set it at a lower level, that could be a problem."",
  ""If they say – if he really wants to be energy independent, like he claims, they could set it at a higher level."",
  ""We have no idea what they're going to do, but they, I believe, today have the ability to set it at whatever level they choose."",
  ""I just wanted to thank everyone for listening."",
  ""I want to – again, we had another very good quarter outperforming most, if not all of the industry."",
  ""We have the best plants, great locations, even a great location for a carbon capture project, which we hope to implement in – sometime in the next couple of years, hopefully sooner than that."",
  ""And most importantly, we feel and we really feel we have the best people in the industry, and that's what sets us apart."",
  ""And again, with the best with our CEO, I consider the best in the industry."",
  ""I think most other people do, too."",
  ""We're well set up for the future."",
  "" very much for listening to the call.""

  ""Welcome to our Q2 fiscal 2025 ."",
  ""I'll begin by discussing our results for the second quarter, and then I'll provide comments on our outlook."",
  ""After my remarks, Dan Fleming, our CFO, will provide details on Q2 and guidance."",
  ""In the second quarter, Credo generated revenue of $72 million, up 21% sequentially and up 64% year-over-year."",
  ""Q2 non-GAAP gross margin was 63.6%."",
  ""The second quarter was our most successful to date."",
  ""We marked record revenue across our three main product lines and began to see the uptick in shipments that marks the beginning of the revenue inflection point we've discussed in past quarters."",
  ""Today, Credo offers a suite of innovative and differentiated Ethernet connectivity solutions, including Active Electrical Cables or AECs, optical DSPs, line card re-timers, SerDes chiplets and SerDes IP licenses for port speeds ranging from 100 gig up to 1.6 terabits per second."",
  ""We are also developing a suite of PCIe connectivity solutions, including re-timers and AECs, which we announced and demonstrated at the OCP Summit in October."",
  ""AI cluster architectures are evolving rapidly, driven by advancements in processing, cooling and power sourcing."",
  ""These advancements enable increasingly dense and scalable clusters, where back-end network reliability has become paramount."",
  ""In this environment, addressing or eliminating link flaps, which are momentary disruptions in network links, as well as managing power and cost, are essential to achieving operational reliability."",
  ""This rapid evolution is creating significant opportunities for high-speed connectivity solutions, which are crucial in supporting the seamless implementation and operation of these cutting-edge architectures."",
  ""Credo's AECs represent a market solution that highlights the company's fundamental differentiation in addressing customer challenges."",
  ""Built around Credo's expertise in SerDes technology, AECs excel in maintaining signal integrity, optimizing power efficiency and delivering unparalleled reliability as data speeds continue to increase."",
  ""This innovation exemplifies Credo's ability to deliver substantial ROI for customers by solving critical pain points."",
  ""In Q2, Credo participated in a number of industry conferences where we demonstrated a broad range of existing and next generation connectivity solutions that we believe will fuel our continued growth."",
  ""For several quarters, we've anticipated an inflection point in our revenues during the second half of fiscal 2025."",
  ""I'm pleased to share that this turning point has arrived, and we are seeing even greater momentum than initially projected."",
  ""I will now review our businesses in more detail."",
  ""First regarding our AEC product line."",
  ""In Q2, we achieved another record quarter for AEC revenue, driven by strong demand from our top two customers and an emerging hyperscaler."",
  ""While we're proud of our achievements, we are also optimistic about the future of our AEC business."",
  ""We believe that we are still in the early stages of widespread market adoption, and we are well positioned as the market leader."",
  ""AI-driven demand for high-speed, power-efficient and reliable connectivity is accelerating."",
  ""AECs outperform laser-based optics, offering lower power, reduced cost, and maybe most importantly, greater reliability."",
  ""We recently launched our 800-gig ZeroFlap AECs for AI back-end networks, supporting lengths of up to 7 meters."",
  ""With increasing rack power densities and the shift to liquid cooling, shorter physical lengths for back-end connections are now possible."",
  ""This enables AECs to displace optics in certain GPU to switch applications."",
  ""Optical link flaps in AI clusters have become increasingly costly, causing significant downtime and loss of productivity for training clusters."",
  ""Our AECs offer unparalleled hardware reliability and have demonstrated billions of hours of operations without link flaps."",
  ""Our system-level focus and collaborative approach to solving critical challenges have positioned us as a trusted partner embedded in the network architecture plans of our customers."",
  ""Building on the adoption and engagements highlighted earlier, our second half revenue growth will be driven by our AEC products."",
  ""Furthermore, we anticipate continued growth beyond fiscal 2025, as market adoption expands across the data center ecosystem."",
  ""Now, I'll turn to our optical DSP business."",
  ""In the second quarter, we achieved record optical DSP revenues, marking another significant milestone for Credo."",
  ""True to our core values, we continue to innovate alongside our customers, delivering enhanced value products backed by exceptional support."",
  ""Our optical module customers and end-users are increasingly realizing tangible benefits from our optical DSP solutions."",
  ""This quarter, revenue was fueled by a broad range of 50-gig and 100-gig per lane solutions, including AOCs and transceivers, supporting port speeds from 100 gig to 800 gig."",
  ""Our unique combination of performance, power efficiency, cost effectiveness and innovation continues to resonate with customers, driving increased adoption across both domestic and international markets."",
  ""We believe the market for 50-gig and 100-gig per lane DSP solutions presents significant long-term growth opportunities for Credo."",
  ""This is supported by robust industry demand and our close collaboration with leading optical module manufacturers and their end customers."",
  ""Looking ahead, we're enthusiastic about the potential of our 200-gig per lane solutions."",
  ""We've recently completed the tape-out of our 3-nanometer 200-gig per lane designs with a strong focus on power efficiency."",
  ""In calendar 2025, we expect to deliver industry-leading full DSP solutions operating at approximately 10 watts alongside LRO solutions at half that power."",
  ""As always, we remain agnostic to our customers' preferences and are committed to providing tailored, high-performance options for full DSP and LRO solutions."",
  ""Credo is actively sampling both solutions with leading optical module manufacturers."",
  ""As architectures continue to evolve, we anticipate growth from both full DSP and LRO deployments, further cementing Credo's role as a disruptive innovator in the optical connectivity market."",
  ""Now, regarding our line card retimer business, in Q2, our line card retimer business also added to our positive overall momentum."",
  ""During the quarter, we generated record quarterly revenue driven by 400-gig and 800-gig applications."",
  ""Our customers included global networking OEMs, hyperscalers and AI appliance manufacturers."",
  ""In this market, Credo is a leader with solutions for traditional retiming and gearboxing, as well as for MACsec encryption."",
  ""Across our product set, we have substantial power consumption and cost advantages against competitive products."",
  ""Going forward, we see continued growth opportunities as line card retimers are adopted for scale up networks in AI appliances and for 100-gig per lane switching applications."",
  ""At OCP in October, we introduced our first PCIe retimers, showcasing our Gen 6 and Gen 7 silicon in several demos, including a 1 terabits per second PCIe AEC."",
  ""Built with our own SerDes technology, we expect to enter the PCIe market with advantages in latency, reach, power and development tools."",
  ""Customer feedback has been encouraging as they've expressed a need for better performance and development support as they plan the migration to PCIe Gen 6 for scale-up networks."",
  ""We plan to sample these PCIe products to customers in calendar 2025 with production revenues expected in calendar 2026."",
  ""To sum up, Q2 showcased outstanding execution marked by record revenues, continued innovation and increased customer traction."",
  ""We are seeing the anticipated revenue inflection point in second half of fiscal 2025, and we are seeing even greater momentum than initially projected."",
  ""With demand fueled by AI deployments and deepening customer relationships, Credo is well-positioned for sustained growth and increasing profitability."",
  ""Now, Dan Fleming, our CFO, will provide additional details."",
  "" for joining our  for the second quarter of fiscal 2025."",
  ""Today, I am joined by Credo's Chief Executive Officer, Bill Brennan; and our Chief Financial Officer, Dan Fleming."",
  ""During this call, we will make certain forward-looking statements."",
  ""These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties discussed in detail in our documents filed with the SEC, which can be found in the Investor Relations section of the company's website."",
  ""It's not possible for the company's management to predict all risks, nor can the company assess the impact of all factors on its business or the extent to which any factor or combination of factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement."",
  ""Given these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events discussed during this call me not occur and actual results could differ materially and adversely from those anticipated or implied."",
  ""The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this call to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the company's expectations, except as required by law."",
  ""Also during this call, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures, which we consider to be important measures of the company's performance."",
  ""These non-GAAP financial measures are provided in addition to and not as a substitute for or superior to financial performance prepared in accordance with US GAAP."",
  ""A discussion of why we use non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the  we issued today, which can be accessed using the Investor Relations portion of our website."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to our CEO."",
  ""I will first review our Q2 results and then discuss our outlook for Q3 of fiscal year 2025."",
  ""In Q2, we reported revenue of $72 million, up 21% sequentially, and up 64% year-over-year, and well above the high end of our guidance range."",
  ""Our product business generated $69.1 million of revenue in Q2, up 21% sequentially, and up 88% year-over-year."",
  ""Notably, our three main product lines grew double digits sequentially to achieve new record revenue levels."",
  ""Our product business, excluding product engineering services, generated another record, $64.4 million of revenue in Q2, 20% higher than our previous product record in the prior quarter."",
  ""Our IP business generated $3 million of revenue in Q2."",
  ""As demonstrated by our product revenue ramp, we are seeing substantial opportunities with customer programs on the product side, which we are prioritizing."",
  ""Given our current product growth trajectory, we do not expect IP to contribute 10% or more of our revenue this year or in future years."",
  ""However, IP remains a strategic part of our business, and we will pursue select opportunities where the combination of strategic relevance and ROI align."",
  ""This prioritization does not impact our long-term model for company-wide, non-GAAP gross margin of 63% to 65%, or non-GAAP operating margin of 30% to 35%."",
  ""Our top three end customers were each greater than 10% of revenue in Q2."",
  ""We had another four end customers that were each between 5% and 10% of revenue."",
  ""While customer mix will vary from quarter-to-quarter, the fact that Credo had seven end customers at greater than 5% of revenue in the second quarter strongly reinforces how we are diversifying our customer base."",
  ""Our team delivered Q2 non-GAAP gross margin of 63.6%, near the high end of our guidance range, and up 73 basis points sequentially as a result of improved top line leverage and higher product contribution margin in the quarter."",
  ""Our product non-GAAP gross margin was 62.2% in the quarter, up 66 basis points sequentially and up 943 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to increasing scale."",
  ""Total non-GAAP operating expenses in the second quarter were $37.6 billion, above the midpoint of our guidance range, and up 6% sequentially due to higher R&D project related spend in the quarter."",
  ""Our non-GAAP operating income was $8.3 million in Q2, compared to non-GAAP operating income of $2.2 million in Q1."",
  ""Our non-GAAP operating margin was 11.5% in the quarter, compared to a non-GAAP operating margin of 3.7% to the prior quarter, a sequential increase of 780 basis points."",
  ""We reported non-GAAP net income of $12.3 billion in Q2 compared to non-GAAP net income of $7 million in Q1."",
  ""Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was $10.3 million, up sequentially, primarily due to our increased profitability driven by leverage from our ramp in product shipments."",
  ""CapEx was $21.9 million in the quarter, driven largely by production of 5-nanometer tape-outs."",
  ""And free cash flow was negative $11.7 million, an improvement of $1.4 million from the first quarter."",
  ""We ended the quarter with cash and equivalents of $383 million, a decrease of $15.7 million from the first quarter."",
  ""We remain well capitalized to continue investing in our growth opportunities while maintaining a substantial cash buffer."",
  ""Our Q2 ending inventory was $36.3 million, up $4.8 million sequentially."",
  ""Now, turning to our guidance, we currently expect revenue in Q3 of fiscal 2025 to be between $115 million and $125 million, up 67% sequentially at the midpoint."",
  ""We expect Q3 non-GAAP gross margin to be within a range of 61% to 63%."",
  ""We expect Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be between $42 million and $44 million."",
  ""We expect Q3 diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 184 million shares."",
  ""As we enter the second half of fiscal year 2025, we expect double-digit sequential revenue growth from Q3 to Q4."",
  ""And from fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2025, we expect year-over-year revenue growth of 100% or more."",
  ""We expect non-GAAP operating expenses to grow at less than half the rate of revenue from fiscal year 2024 to fiscal year 2025."",
  ""As a result, we look forward to driving operating leverage throughout the year."",
  ""And with that, I will open it up for questions.""
]","[
  "" so much for taking the question."",
  ""Bill, maybe my first question is on the outlook for fiscal Q3."",
  ""Obviously, you're guiding to a level that's well above what most of us had in our models."",
  ""I'm curious if it's really the size of certain projects that's coming in above what you were expecting 90 days ago or a couple of quarters ago?"",
  ""Is it the timing of certain projects?"",
  ""What's driving the significant upside in the quarter?"",
  ""You talked about AECs, but if you can expand on that, that would be really helpful."",
  ""And then as my follow-up, one on the competitive landscape in AECs, I think since the time of the IPO, you've always said that competition would be kind of an endorsement of your vision and what you're going after."",
  ""Many companies have spoken to the AEC opportunity."",
  ""It doesn't feel like or seem like they've made significant traction."",
  ""But curious what you're seeing in the marketplace today and any early feedback on the ZeroFlap AEC product."",
  ""You announced that OCP would be super helpful as well."",
  "" for getting me on the call here."",
  ""I thought of the stats that you kind of just mentioned, Bill, the 50% growth into the next fiscal year was the most impressive."",
  ""And I think that if you look at the growth trajectory for you guys into next year, could you maybe spend a little time on splitting out those growth drivers?"",
  ""Because, obviously, you're seeing a really large ramp in the AEC product already."",
  ""But in the preamble, you mentioned that you had taped out that 200-gig per lane DSP solution as well, and you mentioned LRO there."",
  ""Could you maybe comment on what those growth drivers are into the next fiscal year?"",
  ""And to the extent that you can, will that DSP opportunity start to become more impactful in the next fiscal year?"",
  ""And then, this is just a 30,000-foot view question here."",
  ""You're seeing the Ethernet market expand into certain different applications."",
  ""You're also seeing the PCIe market expand."",
  ""You talked about moving into that market as well."",
  ""Obviously, playing in both markets allows you to reap the benefits of growth across both."",
  ""But could you maybe just give your commentary on where do you think the backend moves towards longer term?"",
  ""Is it more towards the Ethernet part of the world or more towards the PCIe part of the world?"",
  ""It's just a constant debate that we kind of run into daily and would love to hear your opinion on it."",
  ""Congratulations on the nice results and outlook."",
  ""I guess maybe to start, Bill, the guidance is well, well above street expectations as you look into the back half of the year for AECs."",
  ""You guys, they think have three 10% of customers that are driving a lot of that growth."",
  ""Can you give us some sense as to the number of AECs that ship sort of per NIC card or per accelerator, and how that ratio may be changing as you look from fiscal 2025 into fiscal 2026?"",
  ""I think in past conversations, you might have implied that you could have one AEC that aggregates the bandwidth from two NIC cards."",
  ""But I'm wondering if that attach ratio of effectively half an AEC to one GPU, if that may now be a number that ends up being too low."",
  ""Just trying to get some sense from you guys what gives you the confidence that the business continues to grow into fiscal 2026."",
  ""Maybe, Bill as a follow-up as you look into the second half of the year."",
  ""Do you see the business, is it mostly driven by just, you guys are seeing an acceleration in the number of GPUs use or XPUs deployed?"",
  ""Is it driven by a higher attach rate as some of these new projects, go to market with more AECs per GPU or per rack?"",
  ""Or is it a mix shift towards higher ASP devices?"",
  ""You talked about 400 gig in the market now."",
  ""You've got the 800 gig, ZeroFlap AECs launching, is it – or is it a combination of all three?"",
  ""Just any color would be would be appreciated."",
  ""And congratulations on the strong results."",
  ""Bill, I have to ask this question just because of history, right?"",
  ""But when we look at this type of growth, what gives you the visibility that, there's not some inventory build here, especially given the geopolitical climate and so on and so forth?"",
  ""And that's my follow up."",
  ""And you mentioned some of this, obviously, Credo is very unique with decision, whether it's copper or optical, PCIe or Ethernet."",
  ""And I'm just wondering if you think about, the large GPU vendor, they obviously chose a very unique system architecture for their latest product."",
  ""I'm just wondering if that has sort of really driven a lot of your customers to focus so much more on using copper?"",
  ""And is that perhaps why you're starting to see these opportunities being greater than originally thought?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""Bill, you said that the second half marks an inflection point."",
  ""What is driving that inflection now?"",
  ""Because when I look at, Blackwell that product has been pushed out somewhat."",
  ""So is this just a lot more hoppers that are being deployed or is it more that there is perhaps more custom ASIC accelerator deployment?"",
  ""I'm just curious to see what is driving this inflection now."",
  ""Just on the 10% customers, how big were these three 10% customers?"",
  ""And as you go into Q3, is the demand growing across these three 10% customers or is it being driven more by one of them?"",
  ""Congrats on the strong guidance."",
  ""Maybe just to follow up on the last question about the hyperscale customer, it's going to be important for the second half."",
  ""Can you talk about the breadth of programs you're penetrating now, maybe versus six months, a year ago?"",
  ""Is it one program that's growing or now penetrating multiple programs?"",
  ""That kind of color would be helpful in terms of diversification."",
  ""And then, I know on the customer diversification staying there, the two hyperscalers you're shipping to now."",
  ""Can you confirm that you're shipping to all four of the large hyperscalers?"",
  ""Or is that – are they in the pipeline or just to understand how you broadened out across the seven large customers?"",
  ""Just a quick question on the AEC side."",
  ""I was wondering what percent of revenues was going to the AI side – AI to AI servers?"",
  ""And if you would be looking to add new 10% customers in 2025 – calendar 2025."",
  ""And so, the second part in terms of new 10% customers in calendar 2025, I guess."",
  ""And on the optical DSP side, just wondering obviously it's nice ramp there, but how many customers do you have on the optical DSP side now?"",
  ""Hey, guys, congrats on the results, and  for taking my question."",
  ""I was hoping you could maybe spend a minute or two talking about your go-to-market and competitive position, specifically on optical DSPs."",
  ""I mean, you cited some pretty impressive power stats on your 3-nanometer optical DSP."",
  ""And also you mentioned that 50 and 100 gig per lane was – hit record numbers."",
  ""I mean, should we be thinking about the 200 gig product serving as sort of a step function change in how you feel about your competitive position against some pretty big incumbents, and 50 and 100 are proving ground?"",
  ""I'd be curious to see – hear you talk about your – the catalysts for further inflection in the DSP market."",
  ""And to follow up, we saw a competitor made an announcement about AECs at one of your lead customers this morning."",
  ""I know you guys have different architectures, but second sourcing and resilience has been increasingly important in the AI ecosystem."",
  ""I wonder if you could maybe speak to how you think your customers think about second and third sourcing in the AECs market specifically."",
  ""And are you guys on – generally, are you going up against or are your customers using AECs from multiple vendors on the same projects or is it spread across different clusters?"",
  ""Just be curious to hear your thoughts there."",
  ""I have two as well."",
  ""First question I was – is on your licensing business."",
  ""I was hoping you could discuss the revenue contribution you anticipate in the January quarter, whether that's also below 10% of your implied outlook."",
  ""And in regards to your licensing revenue, how do you think about the visibility you have in that line item, given I believe, more of your licensing revenue appears to be royalty-based now rather than more of these one-time Sure."",
  ""Of the four customers greater than 5% of revenue that you mentioned, are they primarily concentrated in AECs or is the customer breadth also occurring in your DSP offering as well as line card offering?"",
  ""If you could just speak about the broad segmentation or buckets to where these other four customers are in, that would be helpful."",
  ""We've talked in the past about wanting to have better visibility, as we look at the new projects that we're engaged on."",
  ""And as we're going through qualification and as we start to see forecasts come together."",
  ""Really, in the last 90 days, we've seen a couple of projects come together in even a stronger – with a stronger forecast than we expected."",
  ""I think this speaks to the overall opportunity that we're addressing, especially with the AEC products."",
  ""And so I think it's a nice thing as it's come together."",
  ""As we look towards the quarters that will follow, I think we're encouraged as well, as Dan mentioned, about Q4."",
  ""And as we think about FY 2026, we've been talking about this inflection point for a number of quarters and we're seeing really healthy design activity across several customers and across all of our products."",
  ""And so, we expect to see continued growth over time."",
  ""And although we're not able to really give specific guidance for fiscal 2026, we do expect the growth to be kind of on the order of what expectations have been in the past and that being on kind of the order of 50% annually."",
  ""So, I think that the competitive landscape hasn't changed significantly as we think about over the last 90 days."",
  ""There's no question that the market wants multiple suppliers in the space."",
  ""And I don't think there's any question from our perspective that the market is large enough to support multiple players."",
  ""With that said, I think that we've been clear with the way that we're approaching the market in a sense that we're trying to position ourselves to be first."",
  ""First to deliver unique, differentiated products."",
  ""First to be qualified with any given customer and ultimately the first to ramp production qualification."",
  ""I can't say strongly enough that we view this market and this product family as really a system-level solution."",
  ""And that means taking ownership of the product from a design all the way through being accountable and responsible in production."",
  ""It's really a system-level product from our perspective that's highly complex."",
  ""It's not as simple as putting a retimer into a cable."",
  ""That's under-calling the difficulty significantly."",
  ""And I think more and more as we go forward and we show to our customers that we can work on unique, customized SKUs and turn them around quickly and deliver very high quality and reliable product, I think that that's going to continue to be an advantage and that's going to continue to put us in kind of the pole position on the different hyperscalers that we're working with."",
  ""As it relates to the ZeroFlap AECs, we alluded to this on the last call, but we're seeing that more and more the network reliability for AI clusters is a super high priority."",
  ""Very important thing that, like, if we go back six to nine months ago, this is not something that was talked about so much."",
  ""As it relates to the announcement that we made in October and what we demonstrated, we're looking at and we're talking with customers about the advances that are being made with liquid cooling and power sourcing, in particular as enabling better network reliability in a sense that you can do – if you go from a maximum rack density that's enabled by a cooling and power sourcing, you can actually make shorter connections, connections that can be covered with AECs."",
  ""And AECs are fundamentally more reliable than laser-based optics."",
  ""And regarding link flaps, we've talked about the effect of a single momentary disruption in a connection in, say, a row of AI appliances can basically shut down an entire cluster."",
  ""And it's on the order of 30-plus minutes and also losing productivity in the sense of going back to the start of whatever training that was being done."",
  ""And so, we're seeing network engineers taking a different approach and looking at different architectures and really trying to build out a ZeroFlap capability."",
  ""And as it relates to the AECs, we've shipped hundreds of thousands of AECs over the last multiple years."",
  ""And we have yet to have any customers come back to us and report failures due to link flaps."",
  ""And so, that's – I mean, we're looking at billions of hours in an operating environment."",
  ""And that's why we're seeing this momentum related to kind of row-scale designs versus what we've previously been focused on, which is rack scale."",
  ""Hopefully, that gives you more color."",
  ""Yeah, I would say that the way we've talked about the different product lines that we're developing, we've talked about them based on overall market size, and we've talked about the AEC market being the largest market that we're addressing."",
  ""It is our largest product line, and we expect that to continue."",
  ""So, with that said, we view optical DSP as kind of being the second largest market that we're addressing."",
  ""And this is for Ethernet, of course."",
  ""And then, the copper solution, so line card retimers, chiplets and so forth."",
  ""So, we see the growth over time being driven by all of our product lines."",
  ""And I think that over time, you'll see our revenues almost match the markets that we're addressing."",
  ""But with that said, for sure, the main driver in FY 2026, based on the market size, will be AECs."",
  ""And so, I don't think there's any change in the way that we're thinking about optical being a growth driver."",
  ""Maybe optical from a percentage perspective will be a faster growth product line than AECs."",
  ""But, of course, AECs, we're working from a much larger base."",
  ""But I'll say generally, what we're seeing is great design activity across the board."",
  ""I think the advantages that we bring to the market are clear."",
  ""They're playing out very well."",
  ""And so, basically, kind of the same messaging that we've been giving."",
  ""It's kind of a hot topic, for sure."",
  ""We're a bit agnostic as it relates to ultimately where the market is heading."",
  ""We know that the market is heading towards faster speeds."",
  ""And that really plays to our advantage."",
  ""When we think about our PCIe solutions, we think about the advantages that played out in the Ethernet space."",
  ""And those same advantages that we're bringing to the market will play out in the PCIe space as speeds go to 64 gig and 128 gig per lane."",
  ""With that said, Ethernet is already pushing towards 224 gig per lane and there's a lot of conversation in the market about scale up networks in particular, moving to faster lane speeds."",
  ""And UALink is a topic that is well-discussed."",
  ""And it feels like if that moves towards 224 gig per lane, that surely we're going to be well-positioned for that."",
  ""So, we really look at it as really well addressing both Ethernet as well as PCIe long term."",
  ""And I think the trend towards faster lanes, that's clearly an advantage for us."",
  ""As it relates to architecture what we're seeing is we're really seeing a different architecture based on the different deployments at each customer."",
  ""Now, as it relates to attach rates for GPUs, I think we've talked about a trend moving from one per to multiple per GPU, and it's really based on the simple calculation of lane speeds and number of connections."",
  ""And how does that map to a given GPU strategy."",
  ""But, I think, it's one of those things where we're seeing different approaches."",
  ""And I don't think there's any kind of one-size-fits-all."",
  ""I do think the trend towards a higher ratio of AECs per GPU will continue to play itself out."",
  ""I don't know if I can tie that directly to our expectations for growth in fiscal 2026."",
  ""What I really tie that to is the fact that we've got great design activity."",
  ""We've got great qualification activity across multiple customers."",
  ""And we do see that playing out again across all of the different products that we're building."",
  ""I think, over time, long term, I think all of those factors will play into our growth."",
  ""As it relates to what we've seen in the last 90 days and what we expect through the end of this fiscal year."",
  ""It's more related to the sheer number of GPUs that are being deployed."",
  ""That's the – that's our perception."",
  ""These are architectures that were decided on several quarters ago."",
  ""And they've been going through the qualification process."",
  ""I think this – I think it reflects that the overall opportunity out there for our end customers is big."",
  ""And as it relates to just the sheer number of GPUs being deployed, what we saw in the last 90 days is that number is increasing."",
  ""I think that there's different ways that we look at things."",
  ""And of course, we've talked about the supply chain several times about, from the standpoint of when one of our end customers puts together a build plan, ultimately how inventory is staged, how sets of products are put together by their different partners."",
  ""And we've got a pretty good view into actual deployments, what is consumed."",
  ""And at any given time, you can see that number fluctuate as our customers kind of surge with deployments or maybe exhale on deployments."",
  ""What we're seeing right now is that there's a pretty high consumption rate within our customers."",
  ""We don't see a lot of inventory that's being built within their logistics partners."",
  ""Now, with that said, I mean, I think that, all of us within the supply chain are constantly looking for better visibility."",
  ""Anytime that we see a surge like we see right now, of course, in – from one perspective, you're thinking, okay, what's really happening here?"",
  ""And that's why we're very, very closely following the flow through of the product that we're shipping."",
  ""I personally don't link those two."",
  ""I think that all of these AI cluster network engineers are striving for the same thing."",
  ""But I can't comment about, the GPU supplier and the architecture that they're pursuing specifically to the scale up versus scale out."",
  ""It's hard for me to link those things."",
  ""What we find is that, if we can collaborate and really focus each customer on what the best network architecture is for them, that's where we're seeing success."",
  ""But I wouldn't say there's any kind of larger trend or market direction based on one guy going out there with a certain solution."",
  ""So I think we've been pretty consistent in talking about this for maybe the last say three quarters."",
  ""And we don't see, that this is like a shift to, say, towards the leading edge like you're talking about with Blackwell."",
  ""This is really playing out based on the long-term plan of architectures that have been frozen."",
  ""And this is really just the playing out of a long term plan for deployment."",
  ""Happening a little bit stronger than expected."",
  ""But there is really nothing to suggest that this is based on going towards like, say, a Blackwell type of an architecture."",
  ""I will say that for us, we really don't have visibility into what GPU is being used."",
  ""In fact, any given customer, they could be deploying any number of GPUs."",
  ""What we see is an interface with the NIC card."",
  ""And so, it's really, we're agnostic from a GPU perspective as to the deployments that we're seeing with customers."",
  ""I think that we're, again, seeing design activity with multiple customers."",
  ""And we see that continuing over time."",
  ""And so it's hard for us to maybe talk so specifically about this particular quarter or next particular quarter."",
  ""But we definitely do see that certain customers will surge."",
  ""We've talked about how just as the numbers Dan reviewed that, say, Amazon, as an example, that we saw a surge in the first quarter, saw something that wasn't linear and up for the second quarter."",
  ""And so, you can't read too much into a given 90-day period with a given customer."",
  ""The key for us is to make sure that we've got as much design activity across all of the hyperscalers."",
  ""And that's really going to fuel our growth long term."",
  ""So, we've talked about really being focused on the US hyperscalers."",
  ""And we kind of classify five companies within that category, including Oracle."",
  ""And we've also talked about emerging hyperscalers, companies like xAI, companies like Omniva."",
  ""And so, what we've talked about is we've talked pretty openly about our relationship with Microsoft, our relationship with Amazon."",
  ""We haven't been too clear about exactly which is the hyperscaler that represents customer number three of the five US hyperscalers."",
  ""We did mention during our press release, during the OCP Conference, that we've been doing a lot of good work with xAI, specifically in the ZeroFlap category."",
  ""And so, I can say that we're doing well, really with several customers that will be ramping production."",
  ""With those other hyperscalers, we're making progress."",
  ""I've been pretty consistent saying that with all of our products, starting with AEC, that I expect that all of the US hyperscalers will be consuming AECs in some form or fashion long term."",
  ""And whether that's a Credo AEC or one of our competitors, the category itself, there's no question in my mind that all the US hyperscalers will be using AECs."",
  ""As it relates to optical DSPs, we're really approaching that the same way, that we're trying to ultimately penetrate every single end customer."",
  ""And so, I think we're partially there."",
  ""We're not fully there yet."",
  ""And so, I think that represents further growth opportunities."",
  ""So, just to restate the question, I think you were asking about AECs in particular, how much is related to AI."",
  ""Yeah, I'd say the large majority of the AEC shipments that we're making right now are based on AI applications."",
  ""That's very clear, especially with the solutions that are 100 gig per lane speeds."",
  ""There's no question those deployments are all really 100% is based on AI."",
  ""The way that – you can look at it a couple of different ways."",
  ""You can look at the optical module manufacturing partners that we're working with and the number of relationships there, or you can look at the number of end customers being hyperscalers."",
  ""And I think we're – I'm not in a position to articulate the exact number of customers that we're engaged with, but we are seeing much broader design activity at the optical module level, and we're seeing increased activity from end customers for qualifications."",
  ""We think that our growth in the second half of this year as well as in fiscal 2026 is really going to be driven by 50 gig per lane and 100 gig per lane designs."",
  ""We are excited about the 200 gig per lane optical DSPs that were just taped out."",
  ""We believe that market is going to play out on a little bit longer term than fiscal 2026."",
  ""We really see that becoming a high volume market probably in our fiscal 2027."",
  ""And so hopefully that gives you color."",
  ""The near-term growth is really going to be driven by the large opportunity that we're seeing for 50 gig and more and more so 100 gig per lane designs."",
  ""We're definitely seeing our hyperscaler customers have the desire to have multiple sources."",
  ""And what we're also seeing is that if we can continue to play out our strategy of delivering first samples, delivering first qualification units, being the first to be qualified and the first to ramp, that's always a good position to compete from."",
  ""And so I think we've seen that play out at several, in fact, all of the customers that that we've been working with."",
  ""And I think we're uniquely organized to be able to deliver customized solutions for different customers."",
  ""We're in a unique position in a sense that we've got more than 20 SKUs that we've developed just in the last several quarters for different customers with different flavors of hardware customization as well as firmware customization."",
  ""And so we're really approaching the competition, as how can we do the best job at delivering for each customer?"",
  ""I'm very comfortable living with the expectation that all of our customers are going to ultimately second source."",
  ""So, competing from the high ground is really what we're focused on."",
  ""Well, I'll say that we've been very consistent over the last many, many quarters that we're fundamentally a product company."",
  ""This theme has been very consistent."",
  ""And I think that especially with the product revenue inflection point we're seeing right now, that IP licensing will become a smaller percentage over time."",
  ""We will continue to treat the business strategically."",
  ""We're really ROI-driven as it relates to the different opportunities that we'll see."",
  ""You relate – you asked specifically about hitting a 10% threshold on a much increased number as we talk about guidance?"",
  ""And I would say that my expectation is not to cross that 10% threshold in this current quarter."",
  ""As we look over time, the I think we'll continue to see that this business is somewhat lumpy in the way that the revenue recognition rules are written."",
  ""And we'll have different IP licenses that we pursue that will be a really good return for the company."",
  ""But we can't be too specific beyond that."",
  ""So,  very much for all the questions."",
  ""I really appreciate the ongoing interest in Credo and I look forward to the callbacks."",
  ""So, as we mentioned, we had three 10% end customers in Q2."",
  ""No surprises as to who they were."",
  ""The first two were our first two AEC hyperscalers."",
  ""Then the emerging hyperscaler that we described last quarter was the third."",
  ""So when our Q is filed, what you'll see is that first AEC hyperscaler, which everyone knows is Microsoft, they remained a 10% customer during Q2."",
  ""They were just above that at 11%."",
  ""And the second AEC hyperscale customer we've talked about with whom we have a warrant, they were a 33% customer."",
  ""So, if you do the math, they were actually down sequentially from Q1 to Q2 from $31 million to $24 million."",
  ""And as we mentioned last quarter, we didn't expect their ramp would always be linear."",
  ""However, we stated previously that this second half inflection point, the single most important driver of that is really that customer."",
  ""So obviously, they will become a larger customer as a percentage of the total in our Q3."",
  ""And then the emerging hyperscale customer, they were our third customer at 14% of revenue."",
  ""So from my perspective, one of the key takeaways from Q2 was that we really demonstrated significant revenue diversification from both a customer and product perspective."",
  ""And clearly, there's a broad-based need for innovative solutions as lane speeds increase throughout the hyperscale deployment environment."",
  ""Calendar 2025, I would not expect additional 10% customers based on what we've laid out."",
  ""There have – as we mentioned, this emerging hyperscaler tripped that threshold in Q2, so they could trip that threshold again in the future."",
  ""So, it'll be kind of a repeat of what we've had is our current expectation through calendar year FY 2025 – or calendar year 2025."",
  ""It's definitely broad based is what I would say."",
  ""And in fact, if you talk about the 10% plus customers that we had, those are largely concentrated in AEC."",
  ""But we did make comments."",
  ""We had quarterly strength, sequential growth among all of our top three product lines, AEC, Optical and our line card retimers."",
  ""So if you kind of – you could assume correctly that the additional four customers we talked about was broadly based, not just AEC related.""

  ""Pure Storage delivered solid third quarter results, with both revenues, and operating income, exceeding our guidance."",
  ""As I have discussed in previous calls, we have been engaged on achieving a significant hyperscaler design win by year-end, and I am pleased to announce that we signed a design win with a top four hyperscaler in the last few weeks."",
  ""This is the first ever design win to provide flash for standard hyperscaler storage and it is the vanguard for flash storage providing all online storage in major hyperscale environments in the future."",
  ""For reference, the hyperscale market is responsible today for 60% to 70% of all hard disk drives purchased globally."",
  ""In addition to providing cost effective data storage, this top four hyperscaler's use of Pure technology is expected to free up significant amounts of power and space in their data centers."",
  ""It is also expected to significantly reduce the failure rates and maintenance costs associated with legacy disk storage, while doubling the expected lifetime of their storage infrastructure."",
  ""Pure Storage Purity Software and DirectFlash technology will provide this hyperscale customer the necessary price, performance, density and power to deliver their cloud-based services with unparalleled performance and energy efficiency."",
  ""The close engineering engagement between the companies, and extended testing by this major hyperscaler, has proven Pure's DirectFlash technology is now capable of providing cost effective data storage at hyperscale capacity, even at low cost bulk data, price ranges."",
  ""To fully outline the opportunity here, we are working with hyperscalers to utilize our technology, with a single consistent architecture for all of their online storage, inclusive of low priced bulk storage, near line higher performance storage as well as high speed storage for their most demanding use cases, including AI."",
  ""To support the expected increase in Flash demand for the hyperscale industry, we also announced today a deepening collaboration with Kioxia, a global leader in NAND Flash technology."",
  ""Kioxia has been a steadfast partner in our engagement with the hyperscale community."",
  ""Our design win signals that Pure's DirectFlash technology is now ready to replace hard disks everywhere, and NAND vendors are taking notice and planning their opportunity to address this 700 exabyte per year market."",
  ""As data volumes continue to increase, our combined technologies enable hyperscalers to meet the challenge of increasing data volumes while reducing power consumption, labor, and the physical footprint of hyperscale data centers."",
  ""The work for the design win we announced today started over one year ago."",
  ""While we have had sales of standard product into hyperscale customers, hyperscalers have developed their own software for their storage services which operates on commodity hard disk drives and SSDs."",
  ""Our early outreach to hyperscalers was first met with skepticism that we could achieve the price and performance necessary to replace cheap hard drive storage."",
  ""However this hyperscaler was open to investigating us further, and, working together, Pure optimized the design of Purity and our DirectFlash technology to fit smoothly into their compute and storage architectures, and optimized the economics to fit their financial targets."",
  ""With this win, Pure is entering an exciting new hyperscale market."",
  ""The design win itself signals that this top four hyperscalers' future data centers are approved to use Pure's technology as their data storage standard."",
  ""We expect early field trial buildouts next year, with large full production deployments, on the order of double-digit exabytes, expected in calendar 2026, which corresponds to our fiscal 2027."",
  ""We continue in our dialogues with other major hyperscalers as well."",
  ""Given the significant opportunity that exists for this and other hyperscalers, we anticipate increased investment in our hyperscale line of business over the next year, for which Kevan will provide additional details."",
  ""I would like to turn now to another significant area of opportunity for Pure, namely artificial intelligence."",
  ""AI creates several key opportunities for Pure."",
  ""First, we continue to provide leading edge high performance storage for public and private GPU farms in machine learning and training environments."",
  ""This past quarter we were officially certified for the NVIDIA DGX SuperPOD architecture, designed to provide turnkey infrastructure for the world's largest training environments."",
  ""We recently announced a strategic investment with CoreWeave, a specialized GPU cloud provider to better serve our AI customers."",
  ""Building on our successful, existing, super-computing scale deployment serving thousands of GPUs, we partnered with CoreWeave to make Pure Storage available as a standard option within the CoreWeave dedicated cloud environment."",
  ""Second, many enterprises are considering inference engines and retrieval augmented generation or RAG environments, as they look to apply commercial large language models to analyze their proprietary data."",
  ""This quarter, we introduced Pure Storage GenAI Pod, a set of full stack solutions which reduce the time, cost, and expertise required to deploy generative AI projects."",
  ""In the quarter, we signed a deal with a medical device manufacturer who faced multi-million-dollar interruptions because their legacy storage technology couldn't support a real-time AI imaging system to catch defective products."",
  ""With Pure, they can now run AI analytics, capture metadata, and train their machines to identify and prevent defects, significantly improving their operations and quality assurance."",
  ""Third, AI continues to drive customers to modernize and break down infrastructure and data silos to enable easier access to data."",
  ""Unlike with other vendors, Pure customers will not need to manage different storage operating environments to meet their varied AI needs."",
  ""This quarter, one of the world's leading suppliers to the defense and aerospace industry chose Pure for their AI data storage infrastructure."",
  ""This Fortune 200 customer chose Pure's platform to support a wide range of training, inference, and fine tuning, sharing many data sets and storage environments seamlessly across multiple groups and AI activities."",
  ""The Pure Storage Platform will be used to develop multiple AI technologies to enhance human capabilities, improve aviation safety, reduce pilot workload, and develop human centric autonomous solutions."",
  ""Expanding on the Pure Platform and turning to the enterprise, Pure is driving the biggest shift in enterprise storage since flash."",
  ""With Pure Fusion, we are transforming enterprise data by virtualizing data management and storage and enabling enterprises to create their own data cloud environment across their global enterprise."",
  ""Pure Fusion will be available this quarter as a non-disruptive free upgrade to all existing Pure block storage arrays, and will be standard in all new Pure block products and storage Because of their scale, hyperscalers manage their storage far differently than traditional enterprises."",
  ""Traditional enterprises manage individual storage arrays which are dedicated to specific workloads."",
  ""Storage dedicated to a specific workload cannot be shared with other workloads."",
  ""Therefore data stored for a particular workload is generally inaccessible for other workloads."",
  ""Traditional enterprise storage architectures and products create data silos."",
  ""By contrast, hyperscalers only have a small handful of storage environments, segmented only by price-performance levels, low, medium and high, for instance."",
  ""All data from all workloads and customers utilize the same storage environments."",
  ""This makes data access far easier."",
  ""Different storage capabilities are enabled by software, not dedicated hardware."",
  ""Our experience in working with hyperscalers has allowed us to bring the best attributes of data cloud architectures to enterprise data centers with Pure Fusion version 2.0, which will be released this quarter."",
  ""Pure now makes it possible for businesses to build their own enterprise data cloud, seamlessly combining on-prem and cloud environments to stay agile and competitive in the age of AI."",
  ""Pure Fusion automates data management, simplifies operations, and enhances the DevOps developer experience."",
  ""Fusion empowers enterprises to build their own enterprise data clouds that federate storage across both cloud and on-prem environment, enabling effortless scalability, global accessibility, automated job placement, load balancing, and importantly, AI-ready data access."",
  ""Fusion allows organizations to define and standardize their own customized, global, data management classes, inclusive of performance, cost, resiliency, recovery, and location, and to automate delivery of data services to users via API and according to enterprise policy."",
  ""Fusion fully unifies, automates and delivers the cloud operating model across the Pure Platform, on-premise and in the cloud."",
  ""We have also deepened our partnership with major public cloud vendors for enterprise services."",
  ""With the official preview of the Pure Fusion-powered Pure Storage Cloud for Microsoft Azure VMware Service, or AVS for short, we simplify enterprise migrations from on-premise VMware environments to AVS, enabling independent scaling of storage from Azure compute nodes."",
  ""This first-of-its-kind solution ensures a smooth, efficient cloud transition with minimal IT disruption, boosting cost efficiency, data resilience, and storage simplicity."",
  ""Turning now to the market and broader macro environment, we have not seen any meaningful change in the overall landscape, which remains relatively consistent with the muted IT spending and heightened competitive environments we have seen all year."",
  ""Customers continue to contend with higher software, SaaS and cloud costs, as well as AI spending uncertainty, placing unanticipated pressure on operating budgets."",
  ""While I would have liked to have seen more strength from Evergreen//One in the quarter, we are confident that we are strongly positioned across all of our segments."",
  ""The cloud is not a location."",
  ""It is an operating model enabling self-service, speed, consistent operations, and faster scaling with greater efficiency, at lower costs."",
  ""With Fusion and our data storage platform, we're turning the vision of an enterprise data cloud into a reality for enterprises."",
  ""Our consistent innovation in our industry has been recognized annually by industry analysts, such as our recent 11th time leader position in the 2024 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Primary Storage Platforms, and our 4th time leader position in the 2024 Magic Quadrant for File and Object Storage Platforms."",
  ""Energy availability is a global concern, and has become a critical risk to hyperscalers' operations."",
  ""Some are even contracting with nuclear power plants to secure a reliable supply of electrical power."",
  ""Hyperscalers no longer seek low-cost power."",
  ""They're looking for power at any cost."",
  ""Expanding electricity production cannot add significant capacity for many years."",
  ""Alternatively, replacing inefficient hard disk drive storage with Pure DirectFlash technology represents one of the largest power sources presently available to hyperscalers."",
  ""As power limitations increasingly hinder data center growth, Pure Storage is the only company that can simultaneously enable hyperscalers to cost effectively upgrade their data storage while simultaneously freeing vast amounts of electrical power and data center space for other applications, such as AI."",
  ""Overall, we are very pleased with our progress on our hyperscale opportunity and with the expansion of our enterprise capabilities."",
  ""I am personally more excited than ever about Pure's opportunity ahead, as we drive a new era in data storage management."",
  ""With that, I will pass the mic to Kevan."",
  ""On the call we have Charlie Giancarlo, Chief Executive Officer, Kevan Krysler, Chief Financial Officer, and Rob Lee, Chief Technology Officer."",
  ""Following Charlie's and Kevan's prepared remarks, we will take questions."",
  ""Our press release was issued after close of market and is posted on our website where this call is being simultaneously webcast."",
  ""The slides that accompany this webcast can be downloaded at investor.purestorage.com."",
  ""On this call today, we will make forward-looking statements, which are subject to various risks and uncertainties."",
  ""These include statements regarding our financial outlook and operations, our strategy, technology and its advantages, our current and new product offerings, and competitive, industry and economic trends."",
  ""Any forward-looking statements that we make today are based on facts and assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update them."",
  ""Our actual results may differ materially from the results forecasted, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance."",
  ""A discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties relating to our business is contained in our filings with the SEC, and we refer you to these public filings."",
  ""During this call, all financial metrics and associated growth rates are non-GAAP measures other than revenue, remaining performance obligations or RPO, and cash and investments."",
  ""Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are provided in our earnings press release and slides."",

  ""An archive of the webcast will be available on the IR website and is the property of Pure Storage."",
  ""Our fourth quarter fiscal 2025 quiet period begins at the close of business Friday, January 17, 2025."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it over to Charlie."",
  ""We are pleased with our Q3 financial results, exceeding both our revenue and operating profit guidance."",
  ""Revenue of $831 million grew 9% year-over-year while also delivering strong operating profits of $167 million."",
  ""Strong demand continues for our //E family and FlashArray//C solutions, enabling customers to move their cost-sensitive workloads to all-flash."",
  ""Additionally, renewals of our Evergreen subscriptions across our installed base remained robust, demonstrating strong year-over-year growth."",
  ""Total contract value, or TCV, sales for our Storage-as-a-Service offerings during Q3 was $96 million, reaching $253 million for the nine months of FY 2025."",
  ""Conversion of larger Evergreen//One opportunities valued greater than $5 million is consistent based on our expectations that we reduced last quarter."",
  ""Higher velocity Evergreen//One pipeline that we define as less than $5 million is strong, though, in Q3, we experienced a meaningful increase in these opportunities converting to a traditional sale."",
  ""This contributed to higher than expected product revenues in Q3 while also resulting in lower than expected TCV sales of Evergreen//One."",
  ""Subscription services annual recurring revenue, or ARR, grew 22% to $1.57 billion."",
  ""Total RPO exiting Q3, which includes both subscription services and product orders, grew 16% year-over-year to $2.4 billion."",
  ""RPO, excluding product orders, and associated exclusively with our subscription service offerings grew by 17%."",
  ""RPO growth is impacted by lower than expected TCV sales of our Evergreen//One offering."",
  ""US revenue for Q3 was $562 million and international revenue was $269 million."",
  ""Our new customer acquisition grew by 340 customers during Q3, and we continue to serve 62% of the Fortune 500."",
  ""In Q3, total gross margin remained strong at 71.9%, reflecting strong subscription services gross margin at 77.4% and solid product gross margin at 67.4%."",
  ""As anticipated, product gross margin was influenced by our strategic efforts to help customers transition cost-sensitive workloads to our //E family and FlashArray//C solutions."",
  ""This approach, while resulting in a modest decline in product gross margin, underscores our commitment to delivering cost-effective, high-value solutions for our customers across our data storage platform."",
  ""Looking ahead to Q4, we expect continued strong growth of our //E family and FlashArray//C solutions, resulting in a sequential modest decline in product gross margin, similar to the trend observed from Q2 to Q3."",
  ""Operating profit of $167 million and operating margin of 20.1% during Q3 were positively impacted by revenue overachievement, strong gross margin performance and continued operating expense discipline."",
  ""Our head count increased sequentially by nearly 140 to approximately 5,900 employees."",
  ""Pure's balance sheet and liquidity is strong, including $1.6 billion in cash and investments at the end of Q3."",
  ""Cash flow from operations during the quarter was $97 million and reflects a large upfront payment for new software technology that we licensed."",
  ""Capital expenditures were $62 million and include significant investments to scale operations for our hyperscale opportunities."",
  ""During Q3, we repurchased 3.6 million shares, returning approximately $182 million to our shareholders."",
  ""We also paid $55 million of withholding taxes due on employee equity awards, which also offset dilution by approximately 1.1 million shares."",
  ""We have approximately $213 million remaining on our existing repurchase authorizations."",
  ""We are raising our FY 2025 revenue expectations to $3.15 billion, representing approximately 11.5% year-over-year growth."",
  ""The raise to our FY 2025 revenue expectation is the result of seeing an increase in Evergreen//One opportunities under $5 million converting to a traditional sale."",
  ""While this dynamic increases product revenue expectations, it also reduces FY 2025 TCV sales growth expectations for our as-a service offerings."",
  ""With lower TCV sales growth for our as-a-service offerings, we do not expect the growth of our consumption and subscription offerings will have a significant impact on our FY 2025 revenue growth."",
  ""As such, we are not updating our FY 2025 TCV sales guidance for our as-a-service offerings."",
  ""For Q4, we anticipate revenue of $867 million, reflecting 9.7% year-over-year growth."",
  ""Now moving to operating profit expectations."",
  ""Aligned with our increased FY 2025 revenue guidance, we are also raising our FY 2025 operating profit expectations to approximately $540 million, reflecting an operating margin of 17%."",
  ""For Q4, we are guiding operating profit of $135 million and operating margin of 15.6%."",
  ""Before closing, I'd like to share some preliminary thoughts on our first transformative design win with a top four hyperscaler to help inform your models."",
  ""The commercial framework for this design win involves licensing our technology and delivering support services."",
  ""Hardware will not be included as part of our sale to the hyperscaler."",
  ""We anticipate meaningful revenue contribution and operating margin expansion from this win beginning in FY 2027, which aligns with our expectations for full-scale production deployments reaching double-digit exabyte capacities by that time."",
  ""To capitalize on this milestone, we will increase operating investments in FY 2026, aimed at scaling operations and accelerating our opportunity to deliver Pure's differentiated technology for hyperscale storage."",
  ""When considering these investments, we expect FY 2026 operating margin will be approximately 17%, consistent with our FY 2025 operating margin guidance."",
  ""In closing, as we look ahead, our strategic investments and innovation position Pure as a leader in transforming the data storage landscape."",
  ""We remain focused on execution, while navigating a persistently muted IT spending environment."",
  ""The growth opportunities ahead are fueled by our advancements across our data storage platform, empowering organizations to unlock greater efficiency, scalability, and resilience in their operations."",
  ""We are excited about what lies ahead and confident in our ability to drive sustained growth and innovation."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it back to Paul for Q&A. , Kevan."",
  ""Before we begin the Q&A session, I'll ask you to please limit yourselves to one question, consisting of one part, so we can get to as many people as possible."",
  ""If you have additional questions, we kindly ask that you please rejoin the queue and we'll be happy to take those additional questions as time allows.""
]","[
  ""I know you folks have been working on this for a while."",
  ""Could you perhaps just touch on what drove the decision by this hyperscaler to choose Pure Storage versus building this on their own, given most of these hyperscalers do have a fair amount of resources."",
  ""And then just in terms of the financial impact, I heard you folks talk about in terms of sizing it up a bit."",
  ""But how big do you think at scale this revenue opportunity or TAM could be for Pure?"",
  ""Hopefully you could hear me now."",
  "" for taking the question, and congrats on the announcement as well."",
  ""I guess, just unpacking a little bit of what was just said there, I guess, Kevan, my question is, the financial attributes of this, it sounds like it's a licensing engagement where – are you licensing Purity on a capacity deployed basis, and also licensing the DFM module and therefore you're not manufacturing those."",
  ""Just maybe unpack those, the mechanics of that."",
  ""And then, as we think about this, do you think this hyperscale customer, as they move into next-generational data center footprints that they decide to go 100% flash, or is it a mix of hard drives and flash?"",
  ""Just any thoughts around that would be helpful."",
  "" for taking the question."",
  ""And congratulations, guys, on the hyperscaler design win."",
  ""I believe it's a game-changer for Pure and a potential sea-change in the industry."",
  ""So, Charlie and Kevan, I want to ask a little bit more about the size and structure of this deal."",
  ""So, I guess, first is, could you share what the deal length is?"",
  ""And then, on the revenue opportunity, if I just do some back of the envelope math, it's double-digit exabytes in calendar 2026 even if you just assume – if you assume $0.10 per gigabyte and maybe half of that is recognized since it's software only, then you get to like $500 million in calendar 2026, which means that 2025 is something like could either be zero or close to $500 million."",
  ""So, any color you can share, assuming those ranges are right on 2025 would be helpful."",
  ""And if I could sneak in a follow-up, on margins, too, could you just comment if the deal will be gross margin accretive?"",
  ""And what exactly are the investments that you're making on the OpEx line?"",
  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""Charlie, I wanted to ask you, how does this opportunity change or evolve as you kind of go through your motion of density expansion of the DFM modules?"",
  ""Is this currently based on the 75 terabytes or 150 terabytes?"",
  ""As you move towards the 300 terabyte, how do you expect the volumes kind of evolve in this particular case?"",
  ""This is Matt Calitri on for Mike Cikos over at Needham."",
  "" for taking our question."",
  ""I wanted to clarify, is the commentary around Evergreen subscription TCV and revenue a reiteration of previous expectations?"",
  ""And is there any directional color you can provide on how you're expecting subscription revenue to trend as a percentage of the overall mix?"",
  ""Wanted to check on this, the CoreWeave announcement that you released last month."",
  ""So, obviously, it sounds like that's not the big hyperscale opportunity."",
  ""So, maybe you could help us out in terms of describing the nature of that particular win and some of the color behind the use case and that opportunity."",
  "" for taking the question."",
  ""And Charlie and Kevan, congrats on the results and this exciting hyperscaler win."",
  ""Charlie, you talked about double-digit exabytes in calendar 2026."",
  ""Is this based on the agreement in place or is this your estimate for how big this opportunity can scale?"",
  ""And also on the license, is it a one-time license or is it annually recurring and whether it's tied to exabytes or not?"",
  ""Charlie, in order to understand your reference to FY 2027 and the hyperscaler win, that would help you with double digit exabyte shipment."",
  ""Can you help us understand what is the estimated exabyte shipments in the current fiscal year, fiscal year 2025?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""So, really want to dive into your Evergreen//One opportunity."",
  ""I know you mentioned that some of the more high velocity sales were back to on prem direct sales."",
  ""But now that you have more hyperscale opportunities coming, in addition to the one you announced today, do you think customers might be more likely to move directly to a hyperscaler with Purity Platform and Great."",
  "" for taking my question and congrats as well on the hyperscaler announcement."",
  ""The Evergreen TCV, it appears that most of the customers are transitioning more to a product sale."",
  ""And you mentioned this was probably a temporary phenomena given pressures on OpEx budgets."",
  ""As you look at the pipeline of opportunity ahead of you and as you look into calendar 2025, if you can help us understand what your expectations are for this Evergreen offering and Evergreen services, subscription services to ramp up again to double digit growth."",
  ""Just I'll echo my congrats on the cloud win as well."",
  ""I did want to ask around pipeline, first on the hyperscaler cloud opportunity."",
  ""You guys keep alluding the potential to get other hyperscalers based on your comments."",
  ""So what are you seeing with this similar licensing potential to other clouds in terms of conversations you have going on with, let's say, the top 10 cloud and AI providers?"",
  ""And second, maybe on the enterprise side, is calendar 2025 setting up to be a larger refresh year for storage?"",
  ""Or does that Evergreen model kind of mute some of the impact?"",
  ""Going back to the hyperscaler opportunity, Kevan, your comments around the revenue contribution in relation to data storage capacity purchases would be significantly lower."",
  ""Is that just a lack of hardware as part of the mix or should we think that the pricing of the software itself is also somewhat lower on a per exabyte basis?"",
  ""And just to clarify, is the double digit exabytes in calendar 2026, is that from this one hyperscaler or does that bake in additional wins in the future?"",
  ""It's just that your comment on the relatively lower revenue contribution compared to a capacity, storage capacity sale is that just because of the lack of hardware being sold in the solution, or is it that the pricing of the software itself is somewhat different from the way that you would traditionally be selling?"",
  ""I just wanted to, on the volume being TBD, but kind of having a sense of what the architecture will look like, is the TBD in that you don't know how Yeah."",
  ""I wanted to follow up on the change in the Kioxia relationship."",
  ""Given your comment about the hardware being excluded, I would think the hyperscaler would then be working directly with Kioxia."",
  ""What's changed about that relationship?"",
  ""Because you talk about, hey, more manufacturing capacity and more cutting edge technology."",
  ""It would seem like you guys are being disintermediated."",
  ""Just wanted to ask, on the gross margin front, I think the comment was the sequential decline in Q4 should be similar to Q3 just, if you could just clarify that."",
  ""And then looking out on this line, it seems like the mix might steadily be shifting to E and FlashArray//C series."",
  ""Is that something that we would expect on the product and hardware side to continue?"",
  ""And if you can make some comments on competition now that more of the competitive set has QLC based products in their portfolio, is that piece of the market getting more competitive?"",
  "", guys, for squeezing me in."",
  ""So maybe a question, Kevan, for you on margins next year, you talked about investing in the business to support the rollout in calendar year 2026 and you also mentioned gross margins would be relatively comparable in your fiscal 2026 versus fiscal 2025."",
  ""Can you kind of help us understand sort of where the investment dollars are going because you've been aggressively investing for the last couple of years?"",
  ""Should we expect the same level of growth in OpEx, is that kind of the framework?"",
  ""If I think about 2024 into 2025, should it look similarly in 2026?"",
  ""Charlie, what is the estimated exabyte shipment in FY 2025?, Amit."",
  ""And good to hear your voice."",
  ""As you know, we have been working on this a long time, so there are a number of different factors."",
  ""At the end of the day, it was our ability to provide a number of different superlatives that got this hyperscaler to, I believe, that our technology was the best fit out of anything they could do."",
  ""And frankly, given our experience in this area, the fact that we had it ready for them right away and that – so they wouldn't have to develop it themselves."",
  ""First and in no particular order, really unmatched reliability at scale."",
  ""First of all, we can scale to these exabyte levels."",
  ""But secondly, our reliability now, we are pressing it to 0.15% failure rate per year."",
  ""That compares to failure rates 5 to 10 times higher for SSDs and for hard disks."",
  ""And that reduces overall labor costs and outage costs."",
  ""Secondly, the massive impact on power savings, we have between a 5 and 10:1 improvement – or that is less power than hard disk environments."",
  ""At that level, you see a data center saving perhaps 20% of their total power."",
  ""That's a huge power source if you think about it."",
  ""Think of it as a power source rather than power savings."",
  ""It's power that that's then available for them to scale out in other applications, such as AI."",
  ""Accelerated time to value, we can deliver this to them right away."",
  ""There's no more R&D that really needs to go into – that they need to put into place for this to happen."",
  ""It also fits their architectures very well."",
  ""Our software, remember, is a processor-based architecture rather than a SSD-based architecture, which means that it fits into their virtualized model of having all of their software operate on a processor."",
  ""So, really, it's a much more software-defined model."",
  ""And then finally, unparalleled price and performance, getting to the same TCO capabilities as hard disks when everything is considered, and to do so with five-or-so times the performance of those hard disks, I mean, it's just an equation that's really tough to beat."",
  ""For the economic side of this, let me pass it over to Kevan."",
  ""So, let me start with that."",
  ""So you're thinking about it the right way."",
  ""We're effectively licensing both, the two parts of the technology, that is the software as well as the hardware design."",
  ""The customer will be buying directly from their integrator."",
  ""They'll be buying the hardware, if you will, from their integrator."",
  ""And so, you have that correct."",
  ""So, for us, it comes in largely as licensing fees, software fees and support fees."",
  ""In terms of the – the way the revenue will roll out is, as I've indicated, more in our FY 2027."",
  ""Next year is the ongoing development by this customer of their next-generation data center design, which we're intimately involved in."",
  ""Now right now, what we had to prove ourselves in being able to do, being able to prove in that the price performance level of the majority of their storage, which is then true for all the hyperscalers, which is hard disk."",
  ""But our expectations is that this will be a consistent architecture that they will use across the vast majority of their storage, including their higher performance storage, which is generally provided by SSDs today."",
  ""It's a multiyear duration, although the volumes are TBD."",
  ""It doesn't specifically depend on any one of these things, although they do know our roadmap, and that played a big role in their selection of us."",
  ""They understand that we tend to lead in the density game."",
  ""A lot of the – I would say the bulk of storage for most of the hyperscalers and certainly this one tends to be on the low cost side in terms of gigabytes."",
  ""And therefore, having a solution that stays at the forefront of cost is very important to them."",
  ""At the same time, they are impressed that they can also utilize exactly the same technology for higher performance workload environments and that will be based on the lower density DFMs."",
  ""So, the real magic here is that it's one technology at almost every level of price performance."",
  ""And if you're a hyperscaler, having one technology that satisfies all the different levels of what you need to run the operation is a big positive."",
  ""Matt, let me expand on this a little bit."",
  ""I think what we're seeing in the market is that there's been increased pressure on customer OpEx budgets due to the increase in software costs – unexpected increase that came in software and SaaS costs this year as well as AI uncertainty."",
  ""And so, we're seeing more customers than we had seen in the past who had been considering a Storage-as-a-Service offering, which obviously comes out of an OpEx budget, moving then to a standard product purchase, which comes out of a CapEx budget, which has not been under such pressure this year."",
  ""This market is still evolving, it's still in its early phases."",
  ""We think this is a temporary phenomenon."",
  ""We would expect just because of the superior economics and the superior capabilities that we bring in a Storage-as-a-Service offering that we'll start to see growth again."",
  ""But I think this has been a temporary phenomenon due to the unexpected high OpEx expenditures by organizations this past year."",
  ""And Simon, just so there's no confusion."",
  ""We had announced a double-digit GPU cloud win about two quarters ago, I believe."",
  ""It was Q4, three quarters ago, that was CoreWeave."",
  ""We were not at that point in time able to use their name."",
  ""But that was the deal, that's the infrastructure that's in place there now."",
  ""So that's our expectations for calendar 2026 based on coordination with the customer, but pretty much all sales are TBD."",
  ""The design win is that we are the plan of record, however, just to be clear."",
  ""We're the plan of record for the storage in their next-generation design."",
  ""The licensing – go ahead, Kevan."",
  ""No substantial shipments other than test systems this year."",
  ""It's an interesting question, but I think the answer is mostly no."",
  ""And the reason is the following, our, the infrastructure that we'll be selling to this hyperscaler, and if we were able to win others, similar hyperscalers, is the underlying storage technology, not the storage services that the customer offers to their customers."",
  ""Those storage services are based on their own software, and therefore some of the same software services that they offer today."",
  ""Largely, enterprises move to the cloud because of considerations around their application deployment, much less around decisions around storage."",
  ""And so what – we think those decisions are largely divorced from where they choose to put their data."",
  ""So to the extent that they decide to keep their applications on prem, that's where we generally sell our standard product today."",
  ""And when they decide to keep it on prem, we give them the alternative of using storage-as-a-service that operates both on prem and in the cloud."",
  ""So I really see those as two very separate things."",
  ""And I don't think that our offering of storage for hyperscalers using our DirectFlash technology will dramatically affect enterprise decisions as to where to put their storage."",
  ""On the flip side, I do think that we can bring some of the best attributes of cloud storage to the enterprise with the other announcement we made today, which is that we've released Pure Fusion for download this quarter."",
  ""And what that allows companies to do is build their own enterprise data cloud that consists both of their on prem storage as well as storage that they put on our software in the cloud."",
  ""And this allows them to operate very much in the same way that hyperscalers operate, which is storage-as-a-service, storage-as-a-cloud of data rather than as individual arrays."",
  ""So I see them as building upon one another, but I don't necessarily see our sales to hyperscaler for their foundational storage as making a big difference in enterprise decisions as to where they place their applications."",
  ""Yeah, actually, I'm going to turn to Rob, our CTO, on the hyperscaler discussion."",
  ""As far as the expectations around enterprise, I believe your question really is, are we, do we believe that there's demand being pent up because of a muted IT market?"",
  ""And I do tend to believe that there is some pent up demand being building."",
  ""But we'll have to see on what that looks like as we get into next year."",
  ""It's largely, the exact schedule of the data center buildout."",
  ""That's a little bit of an unknown."",
  ""I would say exactly what percentage we have of the data center is also a little bit of an unknown, although we know that we will, that we have qualified for a very, very large portion of it, but we're shooting for even more."",
  ""So I would say, though, that for the most part, it's about schedule which we're not in control of more than anything else."",
  ""They still have a lot of design, if you will, on their part for other components, including ours but for many other components of their next generation design."",
  ""No, we're not being disintermediated, it is still our relationship with all of the NAND vendors."",
  ""We're responsible for all the qualification."",
  ""We're responsible for the design."",
  ""We will also be responsible for the design of the DirectFlash modules themselves."",
  ""So we're very much in control."",
  ""The hyperscaler uses an integrator."",
  ""It'll be the integrator that purchases the hardware modules and provides it to the hyperscaler."",
  ""Think of it as a meat in the channel model is probably the best way to think about it."",
  ""It's little bit hard to predict."",
  ""It's going to be very low."",
  ""It's a little bit hard to say because as I said it's mostly test environments that we're going into, preproduction environments."",
  ""So maybe one, maybe a couple."",
  ""It's something along those lines."",
  ""I want to  all for joining us on today's ."",
  ""The design win underscores, I think, the critical role that Pure is going to be playing in addressing the high data growth and energy demands of hyperscalers."",
  ""They're facing very fierce competition for power and, even turning to very unique new power sources."",
  ""But these power sources are going to take a long time to come online."",
  ""With power constraints continuing to be a huge issue for them, this is one of the best ways for them to free up dramatic amounts of power on the order of 20% of all the power that they use today and make it available for all of the growth that they have in front of them while improving the overall performance and capabilities of their existing storage."",
  ""I want to thank once again our customers, our employees, our partners, our investors and our suppliers."",
  ""We deeply appreciate all of their continued support and commitment."",
  ""We look forward to speaking to you again next year."",
  ""And , Amit, for your question."",
  ""A couple things I'd point to just high level for you on the financial front, including what this opportunity potentially could look like at scale."",
  ""Charlie mentioned that about 60% to 70% of all this sold today is really driven by the hyperscaler market."",
  ""And so, I think that gives you a good data point in terms of what the opportunity looks like for us long term."",
  ""Obviously, that will result for us in terms of significant revenue contributions over time as well as operating margin expansion over the long term as well."",
  ""In the shorter term, I think there's a couple considerations I would highlight that I also included in my prepared remarks."",
  ""In terms of operating margin for FY 2026, we're expecting that to be flat with this year's guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year of 17%."",
  ""And that's really to enable funding for scaling operations and accelerating the hyperscale opportunity that's in front of us."",
  ""We don't expect meaningful revenue contribution from this opportunity until FY 2027, and that would also include operating margin expansion."",
  ""And it's also important to note that we are not going to include hardware in our sale to the hyperscaler."",
  ""And that's an important consideration for us as well."",
  ""And then lastly, when we're thinking about revenue contribution from this opportunity and we think about it in relation to data storage capacity purchase, it'd be significantly lower than when compared to, say, a sale of our FlashBlade//E solution."",
  ""So I think those are some important points for us to be considering."",
  ""Lots of questions embedded in there."",
  ""Let me first start with the gross margin impact."",
  ""Look, I think the way we're – and again, we're still pretty high level in terms of what this looks like and we'll provide more details as we go along."",
  ""You're thinking about it right in terms of the fact that the majority of the value of the deal will still be hardware."",
  ""And I think that's important to consider for your models."",
  ""I think in terms of gross margin, what we've been tracking as company gross margin is a good way to be thinking about it at this point in time."",
  ""And again, we'll give updates as we go along."",
  ""And I'll just add one thing, Pinjalim."",
  ""As Charlie mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, we've been working with hyperscalers to drive this technology into disk replacement for some time."",
  ""I would say that it was really the introduction of the 75 terabyte modules that really got this particular customer to really pay attention."",
  ""And as we look forward, right, and as we look at the 150 terabyte generation we're shipping now and our roadmap ahead, each step along that path just makes the solution that much more compelling really on the basis of all the superlatives that Charlie outlined earlier, including cost."",
  ""It's a great question, Matt."",
  ""It's really a shift that we saw this quarter in particular with our Evergreen//One higher velocity opportunities where we saw those opportunities converting to a traditional sale, meaning a CapEx sale."",
  ""And so, what that meant is, is obviously we saw higher product revenue and that's really what drove our guide increase for the year."",
  ""And I think that's actually really important as well, right, that when we think about selling data storage technology as a service, it's still early in its maturity."",
  ""And with it, there's a tendency to default to what's easier."",
  ""And that's frankly purchasing technology through a CapEx sale or a traditional sale."",
  ""We're very excited to expand our partnership with CoreWeave, both with the strategic investment we made as well as the commercial partnership, which we announced, which will bring and make available Pure Storage technology to all of their customers in the CoreWeave dedicated cloud."",
  ""As we mentioned in the release, we've been working with CoreWeave, who is the leading GPU cloud provider over the last year And Simon, one last thing."",
  ""CoreWeave is not the top four hyperscaler that we have been discussing today."",
  ""The licensing for the DirectFlash technology and Purity software will really be tied to the capacity that we'll be shipping."",
  ""Appreciate the question, and a couple of thoughts here is, look, when we look at the dynamic of our Evergreen//One conversions, over $5 million there's really no change to what we've talked about from last quarter."",
  ""That was actually quite consistent with our expectations."",
  ""Again, that we spent some time walking through with our investors last quarter."",
  ""Where the dynamic has shifted a bit for us is on the higher velocity Evergreen//One opportunities and this would be $5 million or less."",
  ""And that's where we saw a meaningful tick up, if you will, on conversions to a traditional sale."",
  ""And again, we've talked about that that looks to be not sustaining, especially giving our industry leading Evergreen//One service offering, but specific to thinking and guiding or talking about next year, I want to wait to see how Q4 plays out and then have an update for you all next quarter."",
  ""So, as we said, our discussions with multiple hyperscalers continue to progress."",
  ""And I would say they progressed because of the attributes which Charlie highlighted earlier, our reliability that's unmatched that we can deliver, the significant power savings, certainly the performance envelope we can deliver, all driving TCO savings."",
  ""I think those are the main drivers, more so than the specifics of the financial and commercial arrangement."",
  ""But those discussions continue with multiple additional prospects."",
  ""I do think that today's announcement with both our lead customer in the space as well as our strategic collaboration with Kioxia to go and enable broader penetration of our flash technology into the hyperscalers will serve to accelerate that."",
  ""So we're very excited about the potential ahead of us."",
  ""At the same time, as we mentioned, the design win is a very, very important milestone that puts us in the plan of record with this hyperscaler."",
  ""But there's clearly more work to be done, right?"",
  ""And so we'll be working very, very closely with this hyperscaler over the next year as they continue to progress through typical move to production stages, as they ramp into ultimately what we're expecting to be a double digit exabyte capacities in the fiscal 2027."",
  ""The double-digit exabytes in FY 2027 relates to this hyperscaler design win itself, and our expectations associated with that win."",
  ""And what was your second – your first part of that question?"",
  ""And it really is going to be that the primary driver of this will be the fact that hardware is excluded from our sale and that would be really the primary driver."",
  ""Now when you also think about scale and order of magnitude, pricing will play into it."",
  ""But it's secondary to the fact that hardware is excluded."",
  ""I would also say that this is, it's an expansion of a longstanding relationship that goes well beyond just commercial and capacity."",
  ""We've had a great collaboration with Kioxia in terms of technology roadmaps and technology design and that's a key part of this collaboration as well, which is to bring a co-designed, if you will, as Charlie mentioned, co-designed DirectFlash technology with their leading edge NAND parts to this hyperscaler customer together."",
  ""Tim, out of respect for some who have gotten back in line with the second question, we're going to maybe try to take one or two of your questions."",
  ""Maybe Tim, I'll hit the product gross margin and the sequential decline similar to what we saw in Q2 to Q3 and what we're expecting now to Q4."",
  ""And that really is driven through our strategy of enabling our customers to transition their cost sensitive workloads to our E family and FlashArray//C solutions."",
  ""And it's really all about the strong growth we're seeing across these solutions."",
  ""Now there is less price elasticity for these solutions, given the price sensitivity of the workloads."",
  ""So the combination of the increased growth of these solutions and the reduced price elasticity is putting pressure on the product gross margins that you're seeing."",
  ""And I'll spend some more time next quarter going into more details of our expectations."",
  ""But what I did communicate is the fact that we believe our operating margin of 17% and that's consistent with what we communicated for this year will apply for next year as well."",
  ""And when we think about the main drivers of these investments, I mean, it includes focusing acceleration of our density roadmap with our DirectFlash technology and expanding our supply chain capabilities, qualifying additional NAND suppliers and manufacturing sites, and really integration of our technology with the hyperscaler hardware specifications."",
  ""And that's where we think the significant incremental investments will come from."",
  ""And then when we think about it for this year, obviously we're investing heavily as well from a CapEx perspective."",
  ""And that's why, for the full year of FY 2025, we're thinking our free cash flow margin will be slightly below, 1 to 2 points below our operating margin."",
  ""We're going to take our last question from Mehdi who got back in line for his second question."",
  "" very much, Mehdi, for getting back into the queue."",
  ""So this will be our last question."",
  ""Before we conclude, Charlie, I think you had some final comments.""

67,3128181,001F4B-E,2024-11-15,"[
  ""After my prepared remarks, I will turn the call over to Ceci for a brief financial overview and then we will open the call to investor questions."",
  ""BIO-key reported a solid Q3 performance, with revenue increasing 18% compared to Q3 last year to $2.1 million, which is $1 million improvement sequentially from last quarter."",
  ""Importantly, high-margin license revenue rose 52% to $1.4 million in Q3 2024, which is a significant, significant improvement."",
  ""We also received, subsequent to the close of the quarter, a number of large orders, one from a leading foreign defense ministry as well as the province of British Columbia and Williamsburg, Virginia."",
  ""Again, as I mentioned, after the quarter-end, we closed a large order from a long-time foreign banking and financial services customer for secured in-person identity, a portion of which will be reflected in this quarter or Q4 results and the balance in 2025."",
  ""This customer has utilized BIO-key technology to enroll the biometrics of more than 25 million of its banking customers over the past few years as part of their Know Your Customer, KYC, process."",
  ""And they have been using our fingerprint technology to verify customer identities against the bank card, account number or ID number prior to processing any transactions."",
  ""They are now in the process of upgrading its system to BIO-key's far more robust fingerprint-only ID solution, which allows them to positively identify the customer by matching solely their fingerprint against the biometric record securely stored in the cloud."",
  ""This, what we call one-to-many matching solution, requires greater sophistication and IT resources than matching a biometric to a known account or ID number."",
  ""As a result, the customer plans to host our solution entirely on the Amazon Web Services or AWS infrastructure to support the substantial technical demands of real-time one-to-many biometric ID."",
  ""The customers deploying our enhanced solution utilizing full benefit of our industry-leading biometric authentication technology to provide greater customer security, reduce fraudulent transactions and enhance the customer experience as well as staff productivity by trimming transaction times by approximately 30 seconds."",
  ""If you think about it, 30 seconds per transaction over millions of transactions is a lot of time savings."",
  ""We believe this is a very exciting example of the power and efficiency of our biometric solutions to create transformational business and customer benefits."",
  ""We plan to work with our customer and AWS, our partner, to develop a white paper or case study on this deployment and the significant value and benefits our advanced biometric solutions can bring to large-scale enterprise or government customers."",
  ""We did have a few other large orders from existing customers recently, including a $500,000 follow-on order received in September from one of the world's most respected and tech-savvy defense ministries."",
  ""The orders were pursuant to a three-year purchasing agreement under which the Defense Ministry has steadily expanded its deployment of BIO-key solutions into new programs and user scenarios, allowing for secure phoneless, tokenless and passwordless authentication access to digital services."",
  ""The deployment now encompasses over 33,000 users and we expect additional awards as the ministry expands the scope of our solutions to additional personnel."",
  ""Likewise, as I mentioned, the province of British Columbia is adding 10,000 users to their existing deployment of our WEB-key software, which is integrated with Broadcom's SiteMinder infrastructure to streamline and strengthen secure biometric access to applications via SAML 2.0 federation standards."",
  ""British Columbia is in the forefront of using biometric authentication for roving user scenarios that require advanced security, delivered in a user-friendly way, which is where we really excel."",
  ""Our biometric solutions also reduce the costs and risks of what you have solutions that only verify that a card token or even a password is present, but not necessarily with the authorized user."",
  ""In terms of business development, I want to highlight the recent availability of our PortalGuard IDaaS platform on Amazon Web Services or the AWS Marketplace, which enables Amazon customers around the world to purchase and deploy PortalGuard within their enterprise."",
  ""Over 300,000 active customers find, test, buy and deploy software solutions on the AWS Marketplace."",
  ""BIO-key's position on AWS expands our visibility and reach into the community's substantial base of customer prospects."",
  ""Though we are still in the early days and just starting to roll out marketing initiatives, we've been meeting with the Amazon sellers and partners to support this opportunity."",
  ""We've already begun to source initial interest and product inquiries."",
  ""The continued trend of remote work environment is likely a permanent fixture and additional regulatory requirements are increasing stringent cybersecurity underwriting standards, and they're mandating enhanced security solutions, such as multi-factor authentication for employees, partners and customers that access business systems and data, which are exactly the problems that BIO-key's solutions address."",
  ""As with most small public companies, our performance varies on a quarter-to-quarter basis, mainly due to the timing and impact of larger customer contracts."",
  ""Importantly, we are building a growing base of high-margin annual recurring revenues or ARRs with solid expansion potential."",
  ""We will also continue to evaluate potential strategic opportunities to leverage our core expertise, products and assets to create value for shareholders."",
  ""We believe that the value of our technology products and our customer base with annual recurring revenues of approximately $6 million has a strategic value that significantly exceeds our current market cap."",
  ""Today, millions of people use BIO-key multi-factor authentication solutions on a daily basis for secure access to a variety of mobile and web applications on-premise and in the cloud from all of their devices."",
  ""At BIO-key, we go beyond just password-less."",
  ""We offer phoneless and token-less authentication methods, which is a critical differentiator for retail call centers, shop floor and health care environments where roving workers use shared workstations."",
  ""We remain very encouraged, by the growing enterprise awareness, of the importance of implementing secure zero trust identity and access management solutions, which is really the core of our business offerings."",
  ""We remain focused on driving revenue growth and progressing our business to the point of profitability and positive cash flow over the coming quarters."",
  ""We will support and leverage our channel alliance partners around the globe while also working to progress larger scale customer dialogues via our in-house direct sales efforts domestically."",
  ""Turning to our balance sheet."",
  ""Were successful in improving our cash position in Q3 with approximately $1.9 million in gross proceeds from a Warrant Inducement agreement with an existing holder of BIO-key warrants."",
  ""The investor exercised warrants to purchase over 1 million shares of BIO-key common stock at an amended exercise price of $1.85 and received Series A and Series B warrants to purchase additional shares also at $1.85."",
  ""With that, let me turn the call to Ceci to review financials before we take questions."",
  ""Our hosts today are BIO-key's Chairman and CEO, Mike DePasquale; and its CFO, Ceci Welch."",
  ""As a reminder, today's conference call and webcast and answers to investor questions include forward-looking statements which are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that may cause actual realized results to differ materially from those currently expected."",
  ""Words such as anticipate, believe, estimate, expect, plan and project or similar words typically express and identify forward-looking statements."",
  ""These statements are made based on management's beliefs and assumptions, using information currently available as of today pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""For a complete description of these and other risks that may affect future performance of the company, please see risk factors in the company's Annual Report as filed on Form 10-K with the SEC."",
  ""Listeners are also cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of today."",
  ""BIO-key undertakes no obligation to revise or disclose any revisions to these statements to reflect circumstances or events that may occur after today."",
  ""Now, I will hand the call over to Mike to begin."",
  ""As you know, we issued our  and filed our 10-Q last evening, so let me review some of the highlights, keeping in mind that our year over year comparisons are to the restated 2023 results as filed in our Form 10-K. BIO-key's revenues increased 18% to $2.1 million in Q3 2024 from $1.8 million in Q3 2023 and $1.1 million in Q2 2024."",
  ""The increase was driven by higher software licenses and hardware revenue as several long-term customers expanded their BIO-key deployments, partially offsetting the gains or declines in recurring and non-recurring service revenues."",
  ""For the nine months ended September 2024, revenues were $5.5 million compared to $5.9 million for the first nine months of 2023, as license fees and hardware gains were more than offset with the loss of large recurring software agreement and one large customization customer from the prior-year period."",
  ""To provide more background, we agreed to exit our Swivel Secure services agreement in Europe in Q2, as it had proved to be challenging and fairly low-margin business that did not justify the resources required."",
  ""While the termination of the agreement provides some revenue headwind in the near term, these actions should substantially benefit our blended gross margin moving forward."",
  ""Our overall gross profit and gross margin comparisons improved significantly in Q3 2024, primarily due to a $1 million hardware reserve that was taken in Q3 2023, a higher portion of license fee revenue in Q3 2024, lower costs to support deployments and lower license fees for third-party software included in BIO-key's Swivel Secure offering."",
  ""We trimmed our operating expenses by $46,000 in Q3 2024 versus Q3 2023 due to reductions in headquarters expenses, sales personnel costs, marketing show expenses, partially offset by an increase in professional services, primarily related to the company's financing activities."",
  ""Also offsetting lower SG&A costs was a $122,000 increase in research, development and engineering expense related to personnel to support product development."",
  ""Reflecting higher revenue and gross profit and lower operating costs, BIO-key's net loss improved to $0.7 million or $0.39 per share in Q3 2024 from a loss of $1.8 million or $3.22 per share in Q3 2023."",
  ""For the first nine months of 2024, we reduced our net loss to $2.9 million, or $1.69 per share, versus a net loss of $6.1 million, or $10.79 per share, in the comparable 2023 period, which included a $2.5 million hardware reserve."",
  ""We continue to focus on increasing revenue and controlling costs to support our path to cash flow breakeven and profitability."",
  ""In terms of our balance sheet, the cash position as of September 30, 2024, BIO-key had current assets of approximately $4.6 million, including $1.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2 million of accounts receivable and due from factor, $387,000 of inventory net of reserves, and $383,000 of prepaid expenses and other current assets."",
  ""Mike mentioned two large customer expansions we expect to benefit our Q4 results and future quarters and I look forward to updating you on these and other items in our Q4 call."",
  ""This concludes our prepared remarks and I'll ask the operator to prepare for Q&A.""
]","[
  ""I appreciate the third quarter update."",
  ""And  for taking my questions."",
  ""Mike, great to see the revenue pick up in the third quarter, which I believe is a typically seasonally soft quarter, at least in Europe."",
  ""I guess it was the strength of the stronger third quarter."",
  ""I guess some of that probably has to do with that large order that slipped into the third quarter."",
  ""I think you announced last quarter that there's this large $450,000 or it may have slipped in there."",
  ""But just give me your thoughts on where the upside was this quarter."",
  ""And I do think it is typically a weaker quarter."",
  ""Well, great to see that."",
  ""Another question, kind of a follow-up, is with regard to a specific order you press released it as well."",
  ""It was on September 10."",
  ""It was a leading international Defense Ministry, a $500,000 follow-on order."",
  ""That was announced September 10."",
  ""So, did that whole order get recognized in the third quarter or just curious there if you have that off the top of your head?"",
  ""So, that that was recognized in the quarter."",
  ""And then there's this much larger order from a long-time financial services customer for $910,000 that came subsequently after the quarter-end."",
  ""Will that all get recognized in the fourth quarter?"",
  ""And then, are you implying there's further orders related to that customer after the renewal in February?"",
  ""Or is this kind of a part of that?"",
  ""I appreciate the color there."",
  ""And then just a couple of questions on the outlook and then I'll hop back in the queue."",
  ""So, you expect 2024 revenue to meet or exceed 2023 revenue of $7.75 million."",
  ""So, this implies it looks like you expect at least 4Q revenue of at least $2.3 million at a minimum basically, which is above where I was."",
  ""Do you expect the fourth quarter revenue to be mostly license revenue similar to the third quarter?"",
  ""And maybe a question for Ceci as well, if she wants to chime in here."",
  ""The operating expenses in the third quarter, it looks like all in almost $2.3 million."",
  ""So, a nice kind of reduction from the prior two quarters."",
  ""So, it looks like you have been pretty effective with cutting some costs here."",
  ""Is this a good baseline looking at it, though I can't quite recall, is the fourth quarter – is there a seasonal uptick in OpEx at all or is this a good run rate going forward?"",
  ""That sets you guys up for a fairly reasonable breakeven revenue target, I imagine, as we move forward here in 2025."",
  ""Mike, your license installed base and subscription installed base is kind of ramping up here."",
  ""It has been ramping up."",
  ""Are we at the – do you feel like you're at the point or getting close to the point where you have enough visibility just to kind of introduce formal guidance at some point?"",
  ""I'm just curious to get your thoughts when you might – what needs to happen for you to have that level of visibility and confidence."",
  ""Well, I think that's all the questions I have for you."",
  ""I appreciate the time, and good luck."",
  ""We will keep tracking the story."",
  ""Typically, the Q3 business is softer than any of the other three quarters in the year, mostly, again, as you say, because of the international business, right?"",
  ""Things are very, very slow in Europe in July and August."",
  ""We did have a softer Q2 than expected because of some slips, so that's part of it."",
  ""But we also saw some very strong business, as I described in my prepared remarks, for some existing customers."",
  ""And so, we're seeing a really, really positive trend in the adoption."",
  ""I will call it the expansion of our solutions in some of our larger customer accounts."",
  ""And that's a testament to the stickiness and the quality and the value of what we bring to the table."",
  ""So, this was a very productive and a really good quarter for us."",
  ""As I mentioned, first of all, that was not in the third quarter."",
  ""That was in the fourth quarter, you're accurate with that."",
  ""A portion of it, about $250 or so thousand dollars will be recognized in the fourth quarter."",
  ""And the balance will be in Q1."",
  ""They are an annual subscription customer, and they doubled the size of their deployment, so their annual subscription, I believe, renews in February."",
  ""So, now, that will be part of their newer and updated subscription starting next year."",
  ""So, about $250,000 this quarter and $650,000, whatever, in round numbers in Q1."",
  ""No, there will be additional opportunities and expansion, but their annual now recurring revenue contract size will be in the $1.4 million range, so, significant."",
  ""That will be one of our larger subscription contracts."",
  ""And we expect to have a good solid Q4."",
  ""The Defense Ministry is not subscription revenue."",
  ""They still are our, I'll call it, one of our larger perpetual customers."",
  ""They do -- we do have a subscription element in the agreement, but it's for support and maintenance."",
  ""But the Defense Ministry is just continuing to expand."",
  ""We're up to 33,000 or so users now."",
  ""There's a long, long way to go and a lot of runway ahead there."",
  ""So, that business is going to continue to be significant, right, over the coming two to three years."",
  ""And it'll be in the ranges that we've seen in the past, right, where they've typically spent somewhere between $1 million or so, $1 million to $1.5 million a year, sometimes more, sometimes a little bit less."",
  ""So, it's for support of... I can't say."",
  ""It's dependent on the user count, right?"",
  ""So, it's generally 20% of the typical contract value of the software."",
  ""Yes, it's a subscription, yes."",
  ""The answer to that question is yes."",
  ""I don't have that off the top of my head."",
  ""I don't know how – I don't even know the size of that order, quite frankly, off the top of my head."",
  ""We have and we continue to sell the hardware."",
  ""And we expect to see more significant orders for that this quarter and beyond."",
  ""So, the answer to that question is yes."",
  ""But also, we are very, very focused on higher margin license sales."",
  ""And we're also – we've been laser-focused on especially in our European operation."",
  ""We had a large software maintenance agreement that was negligible in the context of margins and we decided not to renew that agreement."",
  ""So, it's going to have a very positive impact on our overall blended gross margins."",
  ""And more importantly, it's giving us an opportunity to focus more, especially with our resources, on the BIO-key products that are much higher gross margins, which are in the – our software is in the 80%, 90% range."",
  ""So, that's another reason why you're seeing an increase in the gross margin."",
  ""So, overall, this is going to have a much, much better impact on our financials and it's going to create a shorter pathway to getting to breakeven and profitability."",
  ""And we've been, look, exclusive of the write-down and especially over the last year, year-and-a-half on the hardware, our gross margins have been in that range, they have been in the 70s."",
  ""We've been holding in that range."",
  ""And we expect that to absolutely continue."",
  ""Ceci, I think you can... Well, we've already sold some this quarter and we have again – and I think I've spoken to this openly."",
  ""We've been waiting on a very large order for a significant project."",
  ""And it appears that that is going to happen this quarter."",
  ""So, we're thinking this is pretty positive for us."",
  ""As you know, we've written down the entire inventory."",
  ""And so, it's all cash and it all goes to the bottom line."",
  ""So, it's very, very positive impact on the financials."",
  ""You mean is the project in Africa?"",
  ""And it'll be – and some of this hardware as well, which again carries even a higher margin than the software."",
  ""I mean...  I'm not sure I understand that."",
  ""I think what Ceci was saying is SG&A expense, meaning legal and interest, that kind of thing."",
  ""Is that what you're referencing?"",
  ""Ceci, I don't know if you can answer that question."",
  ""Also, by the way, I think the warrant inducement was done in the third quarter, if I'm not mistaken."",
  ""So, that was the third quarter, Dan, so it's already disclosed in... Yeah."",
  ""When you say Swivel service, I didn't, I didn't... No, no, no."",
  ""We had a services... ...support agreement with Swivel Secure Limited."",
  ""And that agreement again was, it was – we really put that in place to be able to support – have a little more control over the support of the product."",
  ""But again, with the amount of resources that were required and the margins on the contract, it just didn't make any sense for us to continue."",
  ""I mean, we always said – remember, we have a reseller agreement."",
  ""We had a reseller agreement in place with Swivel where the margins on what we sold out of that product in the European markets was 50%."",
  ""Our own products, obviously, carry a higher gross margin."",
  ""It was always our goal, right?"",
  ""Over time, we negotiated that contract about two years ago that ultimately morphed those customers into the PortalGuard solution, which is a much higher margin product."",
  ""And so, this is kind of a, I'll call it, the evolution of that business arrangement."",
  ""And again, it just didn't make any sense anymore for the thin margins to continue to operate with that agreement."",
  ""And  for taking the time to join our call today."",
  ""Look for us at the Gartner IAM Conference in December."",
  ""And as always, we'll continue to update you via regular press releases."",
  ""Feel free to reach out to our IR team whose contact information is listed in our press release if you have any questions regarding this call or any other items."",
  "" very much and have a great day and a great weekend."",
  ""It's a fairly good run rate."",
  ""We've done some, as we've said, some financing, so it's a little heavy right now."",
  ""So, we are looking long-term to just cut some of those types of expenses."",
  ""But I would say, the $2.3 million is a good number or less, obviously."",
  ""I think as we get into 2025, I think we will be able to do that."",
  ""You can see that more and more of our business is subscription."",
  ""We have really migrated, especially the PortalGuard base."",
  ""We're migrating that PortalGuard base to subscription."",
  ""We're getting – we have visibility into some larger opportunities."",
  ""And I think we're getting closer."",
  ""I think we're also – look, our goal and objective, obviously, Ceci and I want to get this company to breakeven into profitability."",
  ""We're moving very aggressively in that direction right now."",
  ""So, I hope that we'll be able to do that as we get into 2025, Jack."",
  ""We reduced the inventory by about $100,000 this last quarter."",
  ""We expect at least double or a lot bigger based on the contract that we expect to come in this quarter."",
  ""We're always working on things, so I expect it to continue, but not at the rate it's been."",
  ""Well, for the first three quarters, it's been close to probably $200,000 between auditors and legal folks."",
  ""Oh, we had some associated costs to that, of course."",
  ""Well, I think that's what Ceci said to me."",
  ""We've collected the majority of it."",
  ""We just happened to ship a lot of things in September, so, but most of it's been collected already.""

  ""The expansion of our One Earth Energy ethanol facility to 175 million gallons per year of production is estimated to be complete by the middle of 2025."",
  ""Currently, the electric interconnection from our local utility is moving ahead and should be complete by first quarter of 2025."",
  ""The timeline for completion of the ethanol production expansion has been extended from our previous target to the middle of 2025, due to delays recently communicated by one of our equipment suppliers for delivery of several necessary components."",
  ""After completion of the expansion and emission certification, we then expect to begin the plan further permitting of the One Earth ethanol facility to allow it to produce 200 million gallons per year."",
  ""As I have said before, the regulatory steps receiving an additional permit is the only step necessary to allow for the expanded capacity from 175 million to 200 million gallons as no major additional construction or capital spending is expected."",
  ""The expansion will give REX additional earnings power, allow us to sell more product from our highly efficient consolidated plant in Gibson City."",
  ""We expect that the expansion will provide even greater benefit to shareholders as well as support our ability to self-fund ongoing and future growth project."",
  ""As Stuart previously said, the carbon capture and compression portion of our One Earth Energy project in Gibson City, Illinois, is substantially complete."",
  ""We're excited about reaching this milestone, and we are looking forward to other portion of the project."",
  ""Just add with the expansion of our ethanol operation at the One Earth site, further work and testing in the capture and compression facilities are subject to completion of the utility interconnection to supply power to the project."",
  ""Beyond waiting for power, we continue to wait on several regulatory issues to be resolved."",
  ""Our permit application for Class VI injection wells are still under review with anticipated final approvals slated for July 2025, according to the EPA."",
  ""As a result of these challenges and as the capture and compression portion of the project are substantially complete, we plan to manage near-term major capital expenditure related to the CCS project in order to maintain budgetary flexibility and stay within project spend in light of that timeline for approval."",
  ""Given the new permitting reality, we are confident that pursuing the several ongoing portion of this project in this way is the right path."",
  ""As of quarter end, we have invested approximately $103 million into the One Earth carbon capture project and ethanol production capacity expansion combined."",
  ""Spending for the carbon capture and sequestration project stood at $52.9 million as of third quarter end, while expenditure on the ethanol expansion stood at $50.2 million as of the same date."",
  ""This is compared to total combined budgeted amount of $165 million to $175 million for both the CCS project and ethanol production expansion at Gibson City."",
  ""I would like to hand the call to our CFO, Doug Bruggeman, to discuss our operational and financial results."",
  ""I would now like to discuss how we see the end of the fiscal year shaping up."",
  ""As Stuart stated earlier, our plants continue to run with positive earnings into the fourth quarter, but not at the level of last year's fourth quarter."",
  ""Corn input prices have improved compared to year ago."",
  ""And given the bumper crop of corn in the Midwest, we expect adequate supply for our plants for this growing season."",
  ""As we have mentioned before, we do see Looking ahead to 2025, we are particularly excited about the completion of our ethanol production expansion and anticipated increase in profitability this will allow for."",
  ""We will still expect approval of our Class VI permit from the EPA in the near term and to continue making progress on our CCS facility, which we expect would bring additional profitability once in operation."",
  ""Looking further down the road, the projects we are working on today are laying the groundwork for further potential growth into sustainable aviation fuel and third-party carbon sequestration."",
  ""We're excited about the future as we grow organically and are confident in our team's ability to rise to the challenges at every turn."",
  ""Now, I would like to open things up to questions."",
  ""With me on our call today are Stuart Rose, REX Executive Chairman; and Zafar Rizvi, the REX CEO."",
  ""We'll get to our presentation and comments momentarily as well as your questions."",
  ""But first, I will review the Safe Harbor disclosure."",
  ""In addition to historical facts or statements of current conditions, today's conference call contains forward-looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Such forward-looking statements reflect the company's current expectations and beliefs, but are not guarantees of future performance."",
  ""As such, actual results may vary materially from expectations."",
  ""The risks and uncertainties associated with the forward-looking statements are described in today's news announcement and in the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the company's reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q. REX American Resources assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements."",
  ""I'd now like to turn the call over to our Executive Chairman, Stuart Rose."",
  ""During the third quarter, REX American Resources continued our progress on our three goals for 2024, setting the company up for success well into the future."",
  ""As a reminder, these goals were to continue profitable operations to complete the construction phase of our One Earth Energy carbon capture and compression facility and to complete the capacity expansion of our One Earth Energy ethanol production facility to 175 million gallons per year and move toward the planned further permitting of the facility to 200 million gallons per year."",
  ""To the first goal, we exceeded the mark."",
  ""The third quarter was REX American Resources' second most profitable quarter in the company's history behind only the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Our net income per share of $1.38 was an improvement of 97% over the second quarter of 2024, principally reflecting better corn pricing."",
  ""Gross margin improved over the third quarter of 2023 by 1%, despite a 21% reduction in product revenue."",
  ""As we have consistently said, we believe REX's facilities and personnel are among the best in the industry, which they proved quarter-after-quarter through their attention to detail and awareness of the markets."",
  ""The focus on lean and efficient operations in our core ethanol business, we believe, will serve as a basis for future increases in profit levels."",
  ""Once our One Earth plant expansion is up and running next year."",
  ""It is this part of the business that has allowed REX to grow substantially debt free, maintain strategic freedom, and move forward independently with additive growth projects."",
  ""As we always do, I want to say  to our team for their efforts this quarter and every day."",
  ""And the second goal to complete construction of the capture and compression portion of our One Earth Energy CCS project in Gibson City, Illinois."",
  ""We have substantially realized this goal."",
  ""I'll let Zafar Rizvi, our CEO, discuss the specifics with regard to the remainder of this project later in the call."",
  ""Our third goal was to complete construction of the One Earth ethanol production capacity expansion to 175 million gallons per year to prepare for further permitting and production levels of 200 million gallons per year."",
  ""Right now, we estimate that the facility is on track for completion in the middle of 2025 based upon delays and delivery timelines for certain necessary components."",
  ""As you can see, our efforts to support near- and long-term growth moving forward successfully."",
  ""At the current time, the fourth quarter continues to be profitable, but trails last year's fourth quarter, which was a historically very strong quarter."",
  ""I'd now like to turn things over to our CEO, Zafar Rizvi, to give further updates on our major projects."",
  ""I'll begin with our operational results."",
  ""REX's ethanol sales volume during the third quarter 2024 were 75.5 million gallons, an increase of approximately 3% versus third quarter 2023 sales volume of 73.2 million gallons."",
  ""Average selling price for our consolidated ethanol volume was $1.83 per gallon for the third quarter compared to $2.32 per gallon in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Dry distillers grain sales volume during the third quarter of 2024 totaled 170,116 tons, a 5% decrease over third quarter 2023 volumes."",
  ""Average selling price for the dry distiller grain was $147.14 per ton for the third quarter 2024 compared to $194.94 per ton in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Modified distiller grain sales volumes were 18,392 tons in the third quarter 2024 compared with approximately 13,500 tons in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The average selling price for modified distiller grain was $63 per ton for the third quarter versus $85.86 in the prior year third quarter."",
  ""Corn oil sales volume in the third quarter 2024 were approximately 23.4 million pounds compared to 24.1 million pounds sold in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The average selling price for REX's corn oil products was $0.44 per pound for the third quarter of 2024 compared to $0.61 per pound in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Gross profit for third quarter 2024 was $39.7 million versus gross profit of $39.3 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The 1% increase in gross profit was achieved despite lower average selling prices for all products, which were more than offset by lower corn and natural gas input prices."",
  ""Our selling, general and administrative expenses increased to $8.4 million for the third quarter of 2024 versus $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The increase was primarily due to railcar leasing cost increases and certain donations to local first responders related to the carbon capture at the One Earth facility."",
  ""Interest and other income totaled $4.6 million in the third quarter of 2024 compared with $4.9 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Prior year amounts included $900,000 of COVID-related grants from the USDA."",
  ""Income before taxes and non-controlling interest for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $39.5 million compared to $41.3 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""Net income attributable to REX shareholders for the third quarter was $24.5 million compared to $26.1 million in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""On a per share diluted basis for the third quarter of 2024, this amounts to $1.38 per share of net income."",
  ""The second best results in the history of the company, only exceeded by net income generated in the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""We ended the third quarter with total cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $365.1 million compared with $378.7 million as of January 31, 2024."",
  ""The uses of cash during the first nine months of the fiscal year were primarily related to our ongoing construction projects at the One Earth Energy facility."",
  ""REX American also ended the quarter without any bank debt."",
  ""I'd now like to turn things back to Zafar.""
]","[
  ""Congratulations on the solid quarter."",
  ""I wanted to get your thoughts here."",
  ""There was just an article I saw from Reuters that was saying the Biden administration will finalize 45Z guidance ahead of the January inauguration."",
  ""So, I want to get your thinking as it relates to the growth initiatives on the expansion and on the Got it."",
  ""And then, you all have always been a very prudent allocators of capital, Stuart, Zafar, looking at the incoming, whatever you expect for the incoming policy landscape and recognizing that you've got a significant amount of cash on the balance sheet right now that saw a nice uptick from last quarter."",
  ""If you look at the areas of opportunity for you all in terms of deploying that cash, I think you noted managing cost on the CCUS side of things as you figure out kind of what things look like."",
  ""But where do you see the most attractive opportunities for allocating the cash at this point?"",
  ""I'll take the rest offline."",
  ""Yeah,  for taking the question."",
  ""Following up on the discussion you just had about kind of future federal policy."",
  ""It's probably going to be three months, six months before Congress moves forward with tax reform, which may well include some changes to the Inflation Reduction Act, for example, Section 45Q. Are you going to postpone any kind of decisions on the carbon capture project until you get clarity that 45Q will remain in place?"",
  ""Maybe a follow-up on the ethanol front."",
  ""You have a long history of operating ethanol plants, including, of course, under Trump's first term."",
  ""Can you just give some historical perspective on how the EPA went about setting the blending mandate between kind of 2017 and 2021 and how you managed around that?"",
  ""Yeah, I think the only hope, Jordan, I see because in Midwest is basically the farmers and corn growers."",
  ""And there's lot of support we see from farmers and corn growers because they are also looking for – to see how they can benefit from 45Z as a – crops which they plan to have use different method and no tail and Yeah."",
  ""And I think I'd add to that is, as you know, Jordan, that you have to be servicing by 2032."",
  ""And so, we have enough time – 2034 actually, 2034."",
  ""So, we have enough time to really to be in service before time expire."",
  ""But 45Z was only three years."",
  ""So that's the difference between 45Q and Yeah, I think I will add to that."",
  ""If you remember, we started this project in 2018."",
  ""At that time, there was no Inflation ReductionHi, Jordan."",
  ""My opinion – this is Stuart."",
  ""I'll answer first and Zafar can follow up."",
  ""But if – we also believe they won't finalize 45Z by the end of the term, and we don't know what the Trump administration will do, we don't know their feelings on the 45 period, Q or Z. And so, we remain wary of what they will do."",
  ""And in reality, it's going to be really hard to get 45Z without any regulations and without an EPA permit."",
  ""Right now, it's going to be really hard for us to benefit in the next two years from 45Z. So, hopefully, we can benefit at least get one year of 45Z, but it's going to be very difficult right now because they have not finalized the regulations, and we don't know what the new Trump administration is going to do."",
  ""One other thing, Jordan, at this time – Jordan, at this time, 45Q is in effect, and that's cut and dry at $85 a ton that has passed legislatively."",
  ""So, if nothing – if we don't get 45Z the way the law is written today, we would get 45Q which is $85 a ton, which would still make our project very profitable as long as I keep that."",
  ""Well, one thing we've always done, Jordan, as you know, when the stock drops – if the stock ever drops significantly, we are keen to buybacks."",
  ""We bought back probably more shares percentage wise than any other company I know."",
  ""The other thing is we always are looking for opportunities, whether it's new ethanol plants."",
  ""There are a few that we're looking at, but that doesn't mean anything when they're in the very, very preliminary stages and who knows if anything will happen."",
  ""Generally today, the prices people want is way above what we're willing to pay."",
  ""But that's always an opportunity."",
  ""And thirdly, we're not afraid to go into other things that are either related or sometimes even unrelated to our business that we think our management skills will work with."",
  ""We haven't done that in a while."",
  ""But as you know, we were retailers at one time and now we're ethanol producers."",
  ""So, we're very good at – if it comes to that of looking -- if we see great opportunities of jumping on those, if they become available."",
  ""At this point in time, Pavel, we don't – if 45Q goes away, this is only my -- what I would -- and again, this is not a board of directors decision, it's Stuart Rose talking."",
  ""But as far – we would continue on – we would continue on with carbon capture because we'll get a greater -- if no one else is doing carbon capture, we're doing and we'll get a much greater price for -- I believe we'll get a much greater price for ethanol."",
  ""And I believe there'll still be a market to sell our credits to companies that want to become carbon neutral."",
  ""So, I don't think that we would end our project if there was – and we don't – at this point in time, we don't expect them to end 45, but anything is possible with the Trump administration, and we're well aware of that."",
  ""But my personal opinion, and it's only my personal opinion, would be we would continue on with the project."",
  ""And I think it would still be a good project."",
  ""We wouldn't get government help."",
  ""But there's definitely a market for low carbon jet fuel, and I can go on in California, a few places."",
  ""There's a good market for low-carbon ethanol, and we would be one of the few producers."",
  ""So, my personal opinion would be to continue on with that."",
  ""Zafar, do you want to add anything."",
  ""At that time, Pavel, I believe it was legislatively set, and there were a number of gallons that were – in the law that were , Pavel."",
  ""I just wanted to thank everyone for listening."",
  ""I want to – again, we had another very good quarter outperforming most, if not all of the industry."",
  ""We have the best plants, great locations, even a great location for a carbon capture project, which we hope to implement in – sometime in the next couple of years, hopefully sooner than that."",
  ""And most importantly, we feel and we really feel we have the best people in the industry, and that's what sets us apart."",
  ""And again, with the best with our CEO, I consider the best in the industry."",
  ""I think most other people do, too."",
  ""We're well set up for the future."",
  "" very much for listening to the call.""

  ""Dimitar is in Munich, I am in Sofia, because there is a trade show where we show Shelly X products to a bigger audience and to the target group."",
  ""That's why Dimitar has to be in Munich, but happy that he joins the call as well before he goes to the show, and hopefully gets a lot of customer motivated to use the Shelly X solution in the future."",
  ""I usually start with telling you that we are basically a smart home company – sorry, not a smart – we are a smart home company, of course – we are a software company."",
  ""We are doing smart home products based on our software solutions."",
  ""And the only reason why we have as well very good hardware is when we started this, we did not find hardware that can serve the needs of our software."",
  ""So, we are coming from the software angle, having hardware products as well."",
  ""Why am I stressing this?"",
  ""It's easy to copy hardware."",
  ""It's not so easy to copy software or almost impossible to copy all the things that we have built in our products."",
  ""And why is Shelly an interesting case for investments?"",
  ""We are in a positive market."",
  ""We talked a lot about that last week in our Capital Market Day."",
  ""We have a recognized brand."",
  ""Our technology is way ahead of what competition can offer."",
  ""We have the right scale in the meantime, when that starts to grow, that gives us a lot of potentials for getting economies of scale."",
  ""We have upside potential with new ideas, software models."",
  ""We're working towards recurring revenues."",
  ""We have a strong management team."",
  ""Not only Dimitar and myself, we have a very strong group around us."",
  ""And ESG, everyone is talking about that, a couple of companies are a bit scared."",
  ""We help them to fulfill their ESG goals."",
  ""And ESG helps us as well to fulfill our goals, because we have a lot of products that enable reporting and reducing energy consumptions."",
  ""So, some of the highlights of the nine months."",
  ""We have sold now 18 million devices since we started and sold the first Shelly device in 2018, an impressive number; 8 million in the last 12 months."",
  ""So, you see that this is growing significantly month-over-month."",
  ""And we expect to break through the 20 million line soon in the next couple of weeks or months."",
  ""We have Shelly devices in 3.6 million households."",
  ""That's usually an estimation, because not every household is connected to our cloud, or every device is connected to our cloud."",
  ""We have 1.6 million, close to 1.7 million users of our cloud solution, and this grew by 570,000 in the last 12 months."",
  ""All this shows the success of Shelly."",
  ""Our revenue is growing way above the market, I have to say, in all regions."",
  ""We received – and I always say that it's a bit complicated to get clear market numbers."",
  ""We had a meeting with a very big customer yesterday, who is usually having very good market numbers."",
  ""They are talking about market growth in smart home that is around 10%."",
  ""If you see our growth rates, as usual, we are outperforming the market, although the market is a little bit complicated and we know that a lot of our competitors are complaining, suffering, we are continuing to grow."",
  ""We have successfully enlarged our distribution channel number – I will come to this in a second – with two, three very important moves."",
  ""We have launched around light and building in March this year."",
  ""We have launched our Installer Finder."",
  ""So, a customer that is not able to install the devices himself will now find already 710 or more than 710 installers on our website in different countries."",
  ""And this was growing by 240 in the last three months."",
  ""So, at the beginning, it was a bit tough and slow, but now it's really taking off, and we will have about 1,000 for sure by the end of the year."",
  ""In Q3 alone, we were present on six trade shows, mainly smaller ones in small countries in Europe and Asia."",
  ""And we have a significant growth of addressable customer ownership with our cloud users."",
  ""We have phased out a couple of older product generations."",
  ""This has a slight effect on the EBIT, as you might have seen yesterday already, but not significant."",
  ""And we have a quite a complicated year, because currently, we are working on bringing the Generation 4 in 2025 to the market."",
  ""So, we have to make the first preparations."",
  ""We have just launched Generation 3."",
  ""We still have Generation 2 in the market."",
  ""We have some products from Generation 1 that we will move directly to Gen 4 in the next year."",
  ""So, that's quite complex and that generates a little bit stress on some product generations."",
  ""But we have successfully managed that so far."",
  ""Our cash level, that's an important information, is on the level – on the same level or a little bit better than by the 30th of June this year."",
  ""That's something that we promised that we work on that and we started."",
  ""Our SAP integration is nearly completed so that we will have a much easier life and much better reporting next year."",
  ""And we launched the new Shelly website that showed some successful results and much better customer satisfaction."",
  ""That is more around use cases to address as well, customers that are new to the smart home environment."",
  ""We grew in the first nine months of this year 47.2% to a revenue level of €65 million."",
  ""Once again, information that we get from the market, the market is growing like 10%."",
  ""Let's be optimistic and say the market is growing 15%, then we outperformed the market times 3, maybe even times 4 in this year."",
  ""The EBIT grew a bit under-proportionally with 29.2% to €15.4 million."",
  ""We have an EBIT margin in the nine months of 23.6%, which is still perfectly on track to the 25% midterm target that we are promising."",
  ""And as I said, there were a couple of onetime effects that will not come back every quarter, and we are 100% sure that we will reach the 25% in the 12-month period."",
  ""And our cash is on a level of €11.4 million at end of September, which is €900,000 better than it has been on the 30th of June and which is 37% below the level of one year ago, but you will see later in more details where the money is going."",
  ""It goes 100% in the working capital, more or less 100% in working capital, where we have some significant increasement of stock."",
  ""So, we are very well prepared for Black Friday and for a successful Christmas season."",
  ""And we are growing our number of distributors in the do-it-yourself side, mainly in the professional side, and I want to highlight here two new onboarded distributors."",
  ""One is Ahlsell in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark."",
  ""It's the biggest electric wholesaler in the Nordics region, market leader by far in Sweden."",
  ""Sweden is a market that is important for us where we have a big competitor, and we have signed the contract with them for all Nordics, we'll start now in Sweden."",
  ""And NetXL is a company from the United Kingdom."",
  ""UK is one of our key markets for 2025, 2026."",
  ""We have some very successful meetings with them."",
  ""They are very much committed to Shelly products, to the Shelly development."",
  ""We see some first very good results growth month-over-month that looks very promising and opens new doors to the biggest market for smart home products in Europe."",
  ""Couple of words to the Installer Finder."",
  ""I mentioned that we changed the layout a little bit."",
  ""If you have been previously on our website, you saw maybe the old one."",
  ""Now, we have to go in regions so that you see how many installers we have online in the region."",
  ""When you click on it, then you see how many is this in my city."",
  ""If you type in your postal code, you'll see that who's closest to you and what level of qualification do they already have."",
  ""And after starting in Germany, we have rolled out to Austria, Switzerland, Denmark with a very good success, Finland, Sweden; only two, and Luxembourg; two."",
  ""We have even one – I didn't know that we have one on Palma de Mallorca, maybe because there are some of you guys having houses there, or maybe it's because our Chairman lives there from time to time, but we have one installer onboarded on Mallorca I think for the German community, quite a useful thing."",
  ""And now, Dimitar, a couple of words about what's new on the product side and what makes us special on the product side."",
  ""I want to share some information about the exhibition here."",
  ""It's incredible interest to our booth even though booth is not so big, Some reasons in this slide, I can start with that, it's very important that we are one of the brands which providing end-to-end solution."",
  ""There is not just the heating control, not just the lighting control which many other competitors do that, we are everywhere and with our devices we can automate every single corner and every single appliances in the houses, something which gives the customers just with single choice, single brand to make their buildings and homes smarter."",
  ""And not only this one, because the mindset of the company, how we build it and open the API, open the access to our devices to third parties, we are one of the brands which is covered from many, many other platforms."",
  ""At the moment, I think it's close to 400 different platforms, supporting the Shelly devices."",
  ""And the partners now is the much bigger and popular name in the world, as you see that's in Porsche, Audi, or Harman Kardon, on top of the standard one, which is the Amazon Alexa and Google, which everybody support them and they are – and can work with them."",
  ""But there is many partners and I can say that every month we have at least 10 to 15 more companies which is interested to using and to integrate our devices as part of their own solution."",
  ""And this is – because of this one and everything, we've seen that the Shelly X reached a significant interest for the appliance manufacturers because they know that the appliances with building Shelly devices – Shelly module inside could reach such a huge number of the integration and could be part of this ecosystem which we built last few years."",
  ""Something which make us completely different from any other brands that this is from the very beginning is the community-driven products."",
  ""And community – I can say that this is the community-driven company because we are very close to our community."",
  ""Some information which I want to share, just two weeks ago, we acquired the biggest German And now, we have our additional reach for 100,000 customers, which is the – our customers, but also – they're also using some other solutions."",
  ""Like that, especially for the DACH region, we can cover them with special We have a huge reach."",
  ""As you can see, this is – when – we make a poster when we release the new products, there's over 1 million people see it in a very short time, and which is very important, this everything is viral."",
  ""We doesn't spend additional money to present the products because this is coming month to month between the community and people will start sharing immediately their opinion and start sharing, showing how they can use the devices."",
  ""On top of that, for our customers, for everything which we doesn't want to implement because we don't want to complicate and make complications for the regular customers deeper, we have this user-driven scripting, and now we're very popular between the tech developers, not only do-it-yourself electricians, but also developers because they're using our devices and they make additional programming and developing on top of our software, which give the device additional features, specialized features, for example, special kind of the And something together with that we're accelerating the number of the products, which we released, at the moment, as And very short in the history and there we link a little bit more about the future."",
  ""Now we are in the Generation 3."",
  ""From the very beginning, we start with, let's say, compare with now with the limited feature that the devices could be used only the Wi-Fi connection and MQTT protocol to connect to the third parties and also using the WebSocket Now, we're going to Gen 3, and these devices on top of the everything which we do, now we have a Z-Wave And Matter is there for the very – for the customers which doesn't want to bother with all kind of this technology, and just want to connect these devices and plug and play to start controlling them, there is Matter, and our Gen 3 devices is supporting – or on the way And what next?"",
  ""When we reach the Gen 3 and we start to that, we are also working on the Gen 4."",
  ""And as you've seen, the Gen 4, the main reason for the Gen 4 and the main approach for the Gen 4 is to integrate into devices Ora, Zigbee and Z-Wave for long-range technology."",
  ""And this is very important for us, because like this, if for the moment we are very strong in the smart home and smart buildings, now we're looking for the smart cities, we're looking for the smart factories."",
  ""We're looking for the real industrial automation using these protocols."",
  ""Some of them are all devices to communicate between each other in 5 kilometers."",
  ""In our test, we make a chain of the devices and Yeah, that's – I think this is something which Yeah, ."",
  ""So, the future looks bright, at the very beginning, we said one of our strengths is that we are ahead of competition with our features."",
  ""That is coming mainly from software development."",
  ""We have the right hardware for that."",
  ""And with everything that we have in the pipeline for 2025 and 2026, we are sure that we will increase the advantage that we have to competition and not let it shrink, so that they catch up because they see what we are doing, that we are well ahead and we do this in a typical Shelly way at reasonable prices with a very high quality."",
  ""So, that gives a very positive outlook for 2025 and as well for 2026."",
  ""So, coming back to the numbers, you have seen this chart before, just as a reminder, revenue growing 47%, EBIT on – roundabout 30%, a little bit under proportional, but still on 23.6% EBIT margin which is an outstanding level in the industry."",
  ""And the cash is on the solid level as well."",
  ""That is something that is very important for us as well."",
  ""If we look to the bit more detailed revenue development, quarter-over-quarter, you see a similar picture."",
  ""So, in the Q1s 2022 to 2024, we had a CAGR of 53%, of course, always with some ups and downs between the different quarters."",
  ""In the Q2s we grew in average 49.3% and in the Q3s 43.3%."",
  ""And Q3 is not the strongest quarter, although last year we had very high revenue level with €16.1 million already compared to the year before, a nice jump as well."",
  ""But it's – that's – also everything goes in the right direction."",
  ""Once again, don't forget, we are in a positive market."",
  ""But if the market is 10% or 15%, we are outperforming the market times 3."",
  ""Even if the market would be which is not 20%, we are growing twice as fast as the market, so we are increasing as well the gap to competition in the speed of growing and there is a lot of markets to grab for us."",
  ""On the EBIT side, as I said a couple of times in Q3, the EBIT was little bit stressed by some sell-out activities, one-time activities."",
  ""So, we have 20% EBIT margin in Q3 that reduces the EBIT in the full year to – sorry, that's But we are not expecting such an effect on the EBIT margin in Q4."",
  ""So that, we are sure that we will catch up to the 25% that we promised in the mid-term as an EBIT margin."",
  ""We are well-prepared for Q4 for Black Friday and Christmas with enough stock and the clean stock, so we don't have any burdens anymore there."",
  ""We had some old devices with some older chips that we had to sell out, so everything fine."",
  ""And the feedback that I got yesterday and in the last days from the sales team is as well that the distributors say that the sell-out is working quite well, everything is good, prepared for Black Friday and Christmas."",
  ""You never know how good Black Friday finally will be, but we are looking forward to Q4, that should be as expected, quite strong."",
  ""So, we are confirming once again our numbers for the year and see no problem on the EBIT or on the revenue side."",
  ""The DACH region is still the strongest region, with 51.4% total revenue share growing 47.4% on a very high level already."",
  ""And this is – and that we showed a little bit more details on the Capital Markets Day, by the way, the video is online."",
  ""You can download it in case you have not been there, or you want to check something in more details."",
  ""How did we develop after we put the DACH organization in Munich in place, we see an acceleration of growth."",
  ""That's as well the reason why we will do similar things in other countries."",
  ""Italy is our second strongest country."",
  ""It's not reported separately, but I can say that Italy is the second fastest growing country or region after the country – after the DACH region."",
  ""And we have as well some positive developments, very positive developments in Iberia and in Spain and Portugal."",
  ""In the UK, we are at the very beginning, but with all the meetings we had, we look forward to a very strong 2025 and 2026."",
  ""And the UK market is, size wise, bigger than DACH, so bigger than Germany, Austria and Switzerland together, or on a similar level at least."",
  ""Which means if you see the revenue numbers you have here, that is something that we are targeting in the UK."",
  ""This will not come from one year to another, but in the next three years, we should be on a level as we have it today in the DACH region."",
  ""So, that is one of the focus countries where we are open to invest in people, in marketing activities, visibilities, and we have found good partners already."",
  ""The Rest of the World is growing still on a small level, but it's growing nice, and we have some surprisingly positive on again on a very small level feedback from Asia, some demand coming from regions where we are not present."",
  ""But Japan and Korea is asking why we are not pushing Shelly more."",
  ""We cannot do everything at the same time."",
  ""We are not magicians that can be everywhere at – more than one place at the same time."",
  ""So we are careful with doing too much, not growing everywhere."",
  ""And, of course, for these countries we need additional certifications which are possible to get, so we don't have to make big product changes."",
  ""But it all needs effort, it all needs, needs, work on the R&D team and in other teams."",
  ""But we have more than one leg we can stand on and that is – that's as well, a quite positive On the Premium App side, we have reached €300,000 revenue in the nine-month periods with the Premium App, we are targeting €700,000 this year."",
  ""This can be a bit too much."",
  ""So, it might be that we are a bit below, because we always have three months delay."",
  ""The first three months are free for the customer."",
  ""But on the user side, which shows the future revenue, we already reached €18,000 in the nine-month 2024."",
  ""Our target was €20,000 by the end of 2024."",
  ""And I think that we will reach the €20,000 before."",
  ""So, maybe this month, we are quite close to reaching it."",
  ""So, that is something that is quite positive and we'll have an effect that is then visible in the first quarter 2025."",
  ""So, the other numbers target stays as it is."",
  ""Even though there is a small risk that we will not reach the €700,000 revenue in this year, but we will not fail it with a – in a big proportion."",
  ""Cash flow, that's a very interesting chart for us because we are more or less loan free."",
  ""We have sold our office building."",
  ""We have paid back the loan that we had to pay for that."",
  ""We still have an equity ratio of 88.7% and we have €11.4 million cash on the bank account end of September."",
  ""That gives us enough air to breathe to buy the products that we need for the Christmas season."",
  ""Most of them are there already."",
  ""And as well to have enough stock end of the year because you know that China, Chinese New Year is a period where factories are closed."",
  ""So, for the first quarter, we have to be prepared as well and that gives us enough financial firepower to do so."",
  ""The big thing, that's what I said at the very beginning, most of our cash is going into the working capital."",
  ""So, the inventory increased by €12.7 million."",
  ""We have a total inventory now of €22 million and that's something that we will work on next year."",
  ""This year, this is additionally stressed by the different product generations that we have to prepare."",
  ""We have to buy the chips for Gen 4."",
  ""We had to buy them six months ago already."",
  ""And we have still the chips for Gen 2 and Gen 3 that we will sell out by now."",
  ""So, all this stresses the inventory a little bit, but we are able to manage it."",
  ""On top of this, beginning of the year, we increased our shares in Shelly Tech, that's Qubino, former Qubino company in Czech Republic and Shelly Asia, that was an investment of €1.1 million roundabout."",
  ""We have R&D investments in these nine-month of €1.9 million."",
  ""We sold assets at a value of roundabout 3 million, big proportion is coming from our office building."",
  ""We have paid a dividend of €2.3 million middle of the year."",
  ""And as I already said, we have an equity ratio of 88.7%."",
  ""And I think that is something that only a few company can report about themselves."",
  ""Last time I showed you this chart, because working capital and of course margin level is something that we are working on."",
  ""We want to keep the high margin levels, and this is something that I prepared last time telling you what are we doing in 2025?"",
  ""We started the activities already and here is just with these small bubbles, an update where we are."",
  ""I already said at the beginning that SAP implementation is almost done, so we will be through by the end of the year, and we see that we have better reports that it makes our life easier in a lot of – or will make it easier in a lot of areas."",
  ""We'll save some costs as well, although you know that SAP is never stopping."",
  ""So, we will constantly improve that."",
  ""Next year we will work on the reduction of stock."",
  ""We have four more – five-month of stock now, we want to go down to three to four."",
  ""We have implemented the first things, one thing is the dedicated procurement department."",
  ""We have the first people on board."",
  ""We have decided to have a Chief Procurement Officer."",
  ""We have found the person for that."",
  ""That's not yet public, but we will share as soon as we can."",
  ""And that will definitely improve the quality of planning as well as the quality of negotiating with the Chinese and US suppliers, so, to reduce the cost of goods, to improve the gross margin or keep the gross margin stable."",
  ""We are already much more restrictive with customer payment terms."",
  ""That is something that we started in the last quarter, and we see the results."",
  ""So, we are on the same level with customer receivables, although we have more customers asking for longer payment terms."",
  ""We have checked as well, options for factoring, if we need more cash, we are not using this right now, but we are ready if we need to, or almost ready."",
  ""We will use in the next year whenever we can, airfreight – sorry, seafreight instead of airfreight that gives a huge improvement in costs and in the gross margin, price negotiations have started with some first effects."",
  ""But it's not on the level as we expect for next year and the year after."",
  ""And stock control, so avoiding older products in stock, avoiding situations where we have to sell out some things and this as well, something that is important."",
  ""We started to put the things in place and not yet well-executed."",
  ""It's at the very beginning."",
  ""But we will see effects in 2025."",
  ""If you look to the P&L, here you see that the reason for the stress on the reduced EBIT, it comes from sell-out activities, from distributors and our activities that are booked as marketing expenses because they are doing – they are invoicing us their marketing efforts and that's why it's booked in that line."",
  ""We will, of course – we discuss this, if this is right, here or should be somewhere else, but this will not the total picture."",
  ""That is where the 1-point-something-percent lower EBIT comes from."",
  ""As I said, one-time effects, and of course as well, visibility effects."",
  ""Dimitar is on a trade show in Munich."",
  ""We have been on six trade shows, smaller ones in this quarter only."",
  ""We had three big ones this year with CES, Light + Building and IFFA."",
  ""And these three together is an investment in our visibility of more than €1 million."",
  ""And the rest of the G&A, we have perfectly under control."",
  ""We are growing under-proportionately, although we are hiring a lot of people, especially in R&D. And we will continue hiring people because we have a lot of product ideas that need resources and in the other departments we are more or less okay with the level."",
  ""And so, EBIT margin 23.6%."",
  ""Net income on a proportionally higher level of 21.2%, that comes from – mainly from the effect of selling our old owned office building."",
  ""We are now moving – or we moved into the new building that is rented, that gives us more flexibility."",
  ""And the sales of the office building is not in the EBIT, it's below the EBIT line goes into the net income and that's why you see that this is almost on the level as the year before."",
  ""Some words about where are we on the way to achieve our €105 million target?"",
  ""We reached 61.3% by the end of September this year."",
  ""Last year, we were at 58.9%."",
  ""So, proportionately, we are closer to reaching €105 million than last year."",
  ""I told you that feedbacks from the market are positive, feedbacks from the sales team are positive, so we are very confident that we will reach that target and maybe can be a little bit more."",
  ""But I want to be very careful with overpromising."",
  ""So, we are on a good way reaching this target compared to the other years, everything is perfectly as planned."",
  ""So, the summary, we are a bit above targets, our internal targets with the nine – after nine months."",
  ""The EBIT in Q4 is lower than the average due to some one-time effects in marketing and some sell-out activities."",
  ""And we will stabilize the EBIT on the promised level of 25% in Q4 or in the total year with the Q4."",
  ""All regions are growing above the market, that is a very important thing for us that we continue outperforming the market times 2 or 3 or even above that."",
  ""That's one strong source for revenue."",
  ""We are progressing very strong and going from do-it-yourself to the professional market."",
  ""We now have roundabout a share of 30% in the professional market."",
  ""In regions like the Nordics, we are above 40% already and then that is the bigger market that we are addressing, we want to do that without losing a millimeter of space in the do-it-yourself market, that is very important for us as well."",
  ""And we have signed some important contracts, as I said, with companies in the Nordics about listing us for the installers."",
  ""And we are close to signing contracts in other big regions with these players as well, so that will continue."",
  ""We have a wider product range."",
  ""Dimitar, talked about that, that will continue, and we will have a stronger product selection for 2025 and 2026 that will increase the gap to competition."",
  ""Our cloud service and Premium App starts to deliver as promised, we confirm the guidance for 2024, €105 million revenue and €26 million EBIT."",
  ""2026 goal stays as well unchanged plus €200 million and plus €50 million EBIT, it's something we confirmed as well on the Capital Markets Day last week."",
  ""And beyond that, we are not talking about concrete numbers that would not be serious."",
  ""But if you are interested and you could not join the week's meeting, then please check the presentation."",
  ""You will see what are our ideas beyond 2026 and how do we expect the market and our company to develop."",
  ""Measures to optimize working capital are on the way, that has started."",
  ""We have started some projects."",
  ""We have started to form a new department that we'll work on that, and we'll deliver in 2025 the needed results."",
  ""As usual, you can download the presentation scanning this QR code."",
  ""You can subscribe to our newsletter if you not have done it already scanning the other QR code."",
  ""And now I give back to""

  ""So, two questions for Wolfgang."",
  ""And the first one is on the gross margin."",
  ""I noticed the Q3 gross margin was exceptionally high with over 60%."",
  ""Was it also because of the sell-out of old products or what was the reason for this higher gross margin?"",
  ""And the second one, could you split maybe only indicatively the marketing expenses into trade shows, paid marketing and the partner promotions you told us about?"",
  ""I have a question regarding the clearance sales."",
  ""Do you expect it to occur like every four years or something going forward?"",
  ""Or It's just like...  Okay."",
  "" so much, Wolfgang, and also Dimitar for the insightful presentation and congrats to the numbers."",
  ""We're now, moving forward to the Q&A session."",
  ""And as always, we like to keep the conversation engaging."",
  ""So, please use the raise a hand person to ask your question."",
  ""And you can also use our chat."",
  ""So, first question the – we are – that's an effect that I mentioned in the – when I showed the P&L chart."",
  ""So, we could discuss is the allocation of a relatively high marketing – third-party marketing expenses that comes from our distributors, should they go against the gross margin or in the marketing spendings."",
  ""So, that's something – though we are not touching the invoice prices, that's why the gross margin is quite high."",
  ""And if they invoice us for some email marketing, some trade shows that they are organizing, that goes into the other line."",
  ""So, that's something that we need to re-discuss internally and with the auditors has no effect on the EBIT, zero."",
  ""The gross margin, I think, is a little bit too high because we were planning with a gross margin a bit above 50% and not 60%."",
  ""And that has an effect with one big customer that I cannot go in details, unfortunately, because that would wake up a couple of questions on their side."",
  ""But this is something that we have to look at."",
  ""On the split, I don't have the split in concrete numbers, but a very small proportion is paid online marketing, so we are not spending a lot of money on Google or Facebook paid advertising."",
  ""It's a very slow – small amount of money."",
  ""Trade shows are, of course, much more than last year, especially because we have one big trade show more and a lot of small trade shows more."",
  ""I can only guess that this is maybe €1 million more, €1.5 million something in this direction."",
  ""I can check the numbers and can deliver them afterwards."",
  ""The big proportion comes from sell-out activities, that started already the whole year when we are giving money to our distributors, so that they can stimulate the markets, they can go to their retailers, they can buy places in the stores or visibility in a webstore that's – that goes to Amazon, for visibility on the Amazon Web Shop."",
  ""They have an automatic system, and we have as well a manual system."",
  ""And then on top of this, we have the sell-out activities."",
  ""And all this is – I would say it's a little bit too much."",
  ""And if I want to see something positive in that, we have clear visibility about the numbers now that is coming from SAP and from our controlling department."",
  ""So, we can immediately steer against that and that is something that with all negative points that I can find there, because I'm not happy about losing 1.5% or 2% EBIT, even though it's on a very high level."",
  ""The positive thing is that we have seen that we changed already the mythology, we will have countermeasures and it will not be a miracle to come back to the 25%."",
  ""So, there is never something only bad."",
  ""There is something positive in that as well, and that's what I want to take from there."",
  "" From another side, something which we'll say yes, the Trump, maybe will change a little bit the world or significantly nobody know."",
  ""But I think this is in our favor for something which is behind the scene, which we doesn't share, because it's not part of the Q2 and Q3, but we're working to move the production of the devices for United States from China to Bulgaria."",
  ""And the reason for that is that we are expecting that there will be some import taxes will be increased significantly."",
  ""And if you move this one, we believe that to keep our products to be competitive, competitive not only to be much more competitive than the original China, original, I mean, the made in China, the Chinese product, which will give us the additional advantage, which is this is good for us."",
  ""Currently, we are investigating partnership, possible partnership with a few factories in Bulgaria."",
  ""Which one of them can do this job for us."",
  ""We are also looking for a solution, can we partially producing the devices by ourselves?"",
  ""But in our short-term plan is, well, let's say Q1 next year, we partially or fully to move the production from United States here in Europe especially for Bulgaria, When I talk about the economy in Europe, I still think that is in our favor, because the old – let's say the old approach to the markets give us a high end user prices, a huge discount for the electricians, the huge discount for the wholesaler, which are then end user – end users base then it will not work anymore."",
  ""And not only there will be significant – we've seen that more and more professionals is looking for alternatives and what they can find now, they can find Of course, maybe I would love to have five more, If they're so, successful, okay."",
  ""Seriously what we are doing is we are strengthening the management level below us with – and we did with Germany."",
  ""You know that that I gave up my German position to concentrate fully on the job in the Shelly Group."",
  ""We found a very good successor."",
  ""We are looking for a similar strong person for other regions, for the UK, for other regions in Europe."",
  ""And I completely agree with what Dimitar just said."",
  ""I think that the weakness in European economy – of German economy helps us because we have the right price points and we get more and more feedback from installers that they understand that with our devices they can install more devices, make more money on the installation."",
  ""And just a nice site information that I received this morning, I read this in the French newspaper."",
  ""There is a lawsuit against Schneider Electric Legrand and the big two distributors in Europe, Rexel and Sonepar, because they made illegal price agreements to keep the prices and the margins for everyone very high."",
  ""And the fight is €417 million."",
  ""So, this will be a small earthquake for those guys, although Schneider is a very big company and the others as well."",
  ""But this is all in our favor, because this would open some doors that maybe Schneider and Legrand try to keep closed."",
  ""And although we are such a small company, we know that they had some discussions with Rexel and Sonepar not to list us."",
  ""And so, now, they – I think they have a very clear warning to stop that behavior."",
  ""And one last word about the United States, Dimitar said – said, one thing that we are doing, we are not depending – or dependent on the United States."",
  ""So, worst case, worst case scenario, we withdraw from the United States."",
  ""Trump is making some crazy things."",
  ""We are not able to maintain that, we close completely the United States, which we are not planning."",
  ""That's just to make very clear what we are thinking about that."",
  ""We will not change our 2026 targets."",
  ""It will still stay on €200 million."",
  ""We are not depending on the United States."",
  ""We see some very good developments in Asia."",
  ""This can be more important for us than the US in the future."",
  ""And one more thing, we will – we cannot be everywhere."",
  ""We cannot do everything at the same time."",
  ""This would not be good."",
  ""So, with all the opportunities and options we see and we presented in Frankfurt last week, we need to focus as well on specific product categories, on specific countries, one thing after the other, one thing at a time, and then we will continue growing in the speed that we expect."",
  ""Just promising and say we do everything at the same time, Australia, Asia, United States of America, all countries in Europe, we are not magicians."",
  ""So, I don't have the magic wand of Harry Potter to do everything at the same time."",
  ""We need good people and we are hiring good people."",
  ""Initially, we don't see lower gross margin."",
  ""We see higher gross margins with new products."",
  ""And usually, having different product lineups; so, like, we will have – we will start with Gen 4 in 2025, we will keep the Gen 3 for the – minimum for the full year 2025, and that gives us the possibility to have a stable product line with very high margins and a fighter line that that we can use for Prime Days on Amazon, for Black Friday and for other activities, that just needs to be steered in a better way."",
  ""That's where we need better planning, better procurement, better everything, and we are planning for that."",
  ""And so, that gives us more opportunity than risks."",
  ""Nevertheless, what always can happen, and we are not fail-free, is that you find out that you have too much from one product, as well this might have a negative effect short term on the margin, but in the long term, this might have as well a very positive effect because we are as well thinking about having some products, two or three products for everyone as fighter models."",
  ""And fighter models means that the first product that you have in your Shelly household, and then the Shelly flywheel kicks in."",
  ""And the Shelly flywheel means we know that the average customer adds two devices per year."",
  ""That means if we just take our 1.5 million – easier to calculate – cloud users, that means in the next 12 months we will sell 3 million devices to those customers."",
  ""And if the first product would be a very cheap one with a low margin, the next products will be products at the normal margin."",
  ""So, that is – I don't see a risk there."",
  ""That's just because we have a onetime effect on selling out some things and as well there we might have been a little bit too aggressive because we sold the product in no time and, yeah, maybe we were a little bit too aggressive."",
  ""On the other hand, as I said, the payback will come with the products who buy – the customers who buy the second, third, fourth, fifth product, and that is more than enough for payback."",
  ""I'm not so young anymore."",
  ""So, I have to try to remember three questions... The last one, SE transformation, we have the go from the shareholder assembly."",
  ""We had an extraordinary shareholder assembly for that."",
  ""We are now registering, and registering, if you think that Germany is a bureaucratic country, Bulgaria outcompetes that – outperforms that."",
  ""So, we have registered, it will take some time, it's just the formal act, and then we will be SE."",
  ""Second thing is the trial period is three months."",
  ""And the monthly payment for a user is €3.99."",
  ""The yearly payment is €35."",
  ""Dimitar, numbers are right, did I make a mistake?"",
  ""So, the assumption is that the average customer pays like €40 a year."",
  ""And now we could say, oh, that seems to be very low, we could go to €10 per month, and then definitely people would not buy anymore."",
  ""So, there are not a lot of, if no, maybe successful smart home company with a paid version of the application."",
  ""One big competitor in Germany is Tado."",
  ""They are making losses with their hardware, promising that one day they will make a lot of money with a paid version of their app."",
  ""So, we have to be very careful."",
  ""We do not want to be too hungry and increase the prices too much."",
  ""Maybe it would be even better to reduce the price and to get more premium customers."",
  ""That is more our thinking."",
  ""The last question why am I confident about the UK?"",
  ""We started that – we have a person in the UK, a salesman, and we have a very good – we had very good talks with a couple of distributors, we think that now we have found two very good distributors."",
  ""One of them is NetXL."",
  ""And we had a meeting with the CEO and the sales representative this week here in Sofia with very, very positive feedbacks from their side."",
  ""So, seeing it still on a low level, the development of revenue that they are doing with Shelly devices, the feedback they get from professional customers is super positive."",
  ""We are close to sign with big distributors."",
  ""I don't want to say the names because I'm not allowed to."",
  ""But that would be like a kick start in the UK market and would give us visibility like crazy."",
  ""We are already on Amazon."",
  ""We are on some other platforms."",
  ""And I do not expect miracles."",
  ""I do not expect a huge million numbers in 2025, but 2026 should be very nice and visible."",
  ""2027, I expect a big kick in the market."",
  ""What was the question about Q3?"",
  ""We expected a decline in the EBIT margin not on that level."",
  ""I expected it to be 1% less."",
  ""Unfortunately, we are not able to have 25.0% every quarter."",
  ""And someone who can do that, I will hire him tomorrow."",
  ""You always have some ups and downs."",
  ""And we are in the corridor we were at – we promised 25%, by the way, for 2026."",
  ""So, this was our outlook."",
  ""We reached the 25% earlier."",
  ""Last week, on our Capital Market Day, I said as well that we and Dimitar and I are 100% aligned on that."",
  ""We are willing to sacrifice EBIT percentages for more revenue."",
  ""So, if we would get the same euro amount for more revenue, we would be more than happy because that's a market gain business and it's a euro business and not a percentage business."",
  ""And so, what does this mean, if we make 20 – in 2026, if we make €50 million, not out of €200 million revenue, but out of €250 million revenue, I would be more than happy, because that means we reach more customers, we have more opportunities for the future."",
  ""It's not about percentage EBIT."",
  ""It's about the total EBIT."",
  ""We are in a very healthy situation."",
  ""And once again, if someone is able to steer the company exactly on the point, I would start to be a bit suspicious to say, what is everything fine, well, how are they doing this?"",
  ""You always have 1%, 2% up and downs on this level of EBIT margin."",
  ""I'm not talking about retail business where you have 2% total EBIT."",
  ""We have 25% total EBIT, and now we have 23-point-something, which is for me perfect."",
  ""The outlook for the future is increasing that a little bit."",
  ""We were a bit too aggressive on sellout, afterwards, you always know better than before."",
  ""And I think the positive thing is that sometimes you need to be in – if everything goes perfect, revenue grows, EBIT grows, everything fine, you might be a bit lazy."",
  ""And this is a wake-up call exactly at the right time so that everyone in the company is, oops, let's pay attention to get this 1% back, and we will."",
  ""Trump – if you pay attention, Trump said that he will increase the import duties from Mexico by 100% or something like that because he doesn't like Mexico."",
  ""And so, this is not an option."",
  ""It might be one, if he is not increasing the import duties."",
  ""He might increase the import duties from Europe as well, not on the level as he wants to do this from China."",
  ""But Bulgaria has one advantage."",
  ""We know that the labor costs here are low."",
  ""We know that we could produce on a similar level as in China."",
  ""The shipment costs for spare parts, materials from China to Bulgaria would be more expensive than shipping the final product."",
  ""So, we would have some disadvantages."",
  ""And on the other hand, we might have some support from the European Union to open a factory here that would help on the investment side."",
  ""Dimitar, you want to add something?"",
  ""I want to add something."",
  ""Also, devices produced will have a Yeah."",
  ""So,  again for joining."",
  ""And especially  again for joining after so many people joined last week's Capital Market Day, that shows the interest in Shelly, and we are really proud to have you on board as analysts or as investors already or maybe future investors."",
  ""And we can promise that we will do the maximum to reach our targets and to keep our promises."",
  "" very much, and have a good rest of the week."",
  "" very much from my side, too."",
  "" so much, Wolfgang and Dimitar."",
  ""And we're coming now to an end to today's ."",
  ""I  so much for your attention."",
  ""Should any further questions arise in the future, please do not hesitate to contact us or the investor relations management team."",
  ""And of course, I hand over now for some final remarks to the leadership team."",
  "" so much, and have a good day.""

  ""Today we will share progress and updates from the third quarter of this year, highlighting developments we've made in advancing our platform, actualizing the potential of this powerful subclass of T cells, these allogeneic invariant natural killer T cells, or iNKTs."",
  ""With our fully integrated discovery platform, engineering expertise and manufacturing innovation, we're poised to deliver what we believe to be the most scalable and transformative cell therapy platform for patients facing solid tumor cancers and other immune-related diseases."",
  ""Importantly, we have the capacity to truly democratize access to these innovative therapies, enabling their development and the application beyond rare disease settings, and expanding the treatment possibilities for a much broader patient population and much broader set of diseases."",
  ""We've been able to make this progress with even further operating efficiencies and reductions in operating burn by nearly an additional 60% at the same time from last year alone."",
  ""While this is in large part a cost offset by external funding of our clinical programs, we've continued to develop manufacturing efficiencies that reduce our cost of goods and increased scale and production capacity."",
  ""We remain acutely aware of our cash position, and while we look forward to strengthening this position, we will continue to identify additional areas for cost containment and efficiency."",
  ""I'd like to begin the call today with – by informing you of a key addition to our leadership team."",
  ""Just a couple of weeks ago, we welcomed Dr. Robert or Bob Kadlec to our Board of Directors."",
  ""Dr. Kadlec's decades of experience in public health and biodefense, including his role as Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the US Department of Health and Human Services, brings immense strategic value to MiNK."",
  ""Dr. Kadlec spearheaded critical initiatives in pandemic preparedness, emergency response coordination, and medical countermeasure development."",
  ""His insights into public-private partnerships and comprehensive health strategies will be invaluable as we expand the application of our iNKT cell platform, particularly in tackling infectious disease and high-impact health challenges."",
  ""In addition to strengthening our leadership, we've made advancements in our clinical programs and advancements in our preclinical progress."",
  ""On the clinical front, our lead program, agenT-797, is progressing in a Phase 2 trial for second line gastric -- advanced gastric cancer at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center."",
  ""This trial incorporates botensilimab, balstilimab, chemotherapy, on top of our iNKT cell therapy."",
  ""Data from the first half of the patient cohorts treated indicate very promising signals of efficacy or activity compared to existing treatment options."",
  ""We look very forward to presenting these data at a major oncology conference in early 2025."",
  ""Furthermore, data presented last week at the Society for Immune Therapy of Cancer or SITC annual meeting showcased wonderful progress of our iNKT cell therapy programs, highlighting the significant potential of agenT-797 to expand the benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors, as well as bispecific engagers in areas where we have seen these approaches fall short in this clinic."",
  ""Additionally, we presented data on our novel PRAME-TCR designed to address the unmet needs of intracellular targeting to eradicate PRAME-expressing tumors."",
  ""These findings underscore the unique mechanisms of iNKT cells, highlight the activity of our platform to create high-throughput medicines quickly, and show that we can enhance the effectiveness of commonly used therapies through strategic synergistic combinations."",
  ""These advancements offer promising new strategies for patients with challenging diseases."",
  ""To provide more detail on our findings presented at SITC, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Nils Rudqvist and Dr. Paul Ibbett to give you an overview."",
  ""An important component of our program and our progress that was also presented at SITC is an expanded glimpse of data from our Phase 1 study, where we have continued to ascertain data on heavily pretreated patients who are now beyond a median of 12 months of overall survival follow-up."",
  ""What we've observed is that we've continued to see long-term disease stabilization and a lack of progression in the patients treated."",
  ""These data further underscore the persistence of these cells and the immune modulation that they induce clinically."",
  ""As we mentioned during our last call, in addition to the program that we have advancing in gastric cancer, already activated and enrolling with enrollment expected to complete by mid-next year, we've also identified expert investigators and a program to advance iNKT cells, agenT-797 in patients with graft versus host disease."",
  ""And I'm pleased to provide a brief update on the advancements that we've made in this program since our last engagement."",
  ""We are focusing primarily on the prevention and treatment of acute GvHD, a significant complication following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."",
  ""These and other factors that affect transplant outcomes, such as chronic GvHD, disease recurrence, and post-transplant infection."",
  ""Our lead candidate, agenT-797 has demonstrated the potential to modulate immune responses effectively without triggering graft versus host reactions."",
  ""And in fact, what we have observed preclinically as well as in some of our preliminary data through our collaboration, is that iNKTs, in fact, mitigate graft versus host disease biologically and immunologically."",
  ""This is particularly impactful for patients who experience severe GvHD, which can affect major organs and lead to high morbidity and mortality."",
  ""Our ongoing implementation of a Phase 1 trial in collaboration with leading institutions in the US and Europe, target patients who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant and are at a high risk for developing GvHD and other undesired outcomes."",
  ""We are currently in the activation phase after having defined the optimal protocol design."",
  ""And in parallel with the Phase 1 clinical study activation, we are further advancing preclinical investigations in collaboration with Dr. Jenny Gumperz Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health."",
  ""This project will conduct preclinical studies to evaluate agenT-797's efficacy in reducing and eliminating graft versus host disease and improving immune engraftment post stem cell transplantation."",
  ""We expect that this project to receive feedback from submitted grant funding later this month."",
  ""And finally, earlier this quarter, we announced collaboration with Autonomous Therapeutics."",
  ""By combining their encryptive RNA or encRNA technology with MiNK iNKT cell therapies MiNK-215, and agenT-797, we aim to develop innovative solutions for targeting metastatic cancer cells more effectively."",
  ""This partnership represents a significant step forward in enhancing clinical outcomes and delivering better patient care through cutting edge technology."",
  ""We're encouraged by our progress this quarter."",
  ""We remain focused on accelerating our programs to bring these therapies to patients in need."",
  ""And at the same time, of course, we continue to prioritize our financial discipline and explore strategic initiatives to strengthen our financial position."",
  ""Our goal is to ensure we have the necessary resources to support our growth and the development of our iNKT cell therapy platform."",
  "" to the entire MiNK team and our partners for your continued dedication and support."",
  ""I'll now turn the call over to Christine to review our financials."",
  ""And  all for joining us today."",
  ""Today's call is being webcast and will be available on our website for replay."",
  ""I'd like to remind you that this call will include forward-looking statements, including those related to our clinical development, regulatory and commercial plans, time for data releases, and partnership opportunities."",
  ""These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties."",
  ""Please refer to our SEC filings available on our website for a detailed description of these risks."",
  ""Joining me today are Dr. Jennifer Buell, President and Chief Executive Officer; Christine Klaskin, Principal Financial and Accounting Officer; Dr. Nils Rudqvist, Director of Research; and Dr. Paul Ibbett, Scientist at MiNK."",
  ""Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Dr. Buell to highlight our progress from this quarter."",
  ""At SITC last weekend, we continued building on our Phase 1 data, which demonstrated that agenT-797, whether used as a monotherapy or in combination with anti-PD-1 therapies like This year, we also demonstrated that agenT-797, when combined with bispecific engagers, targeting antigens such as Now, I'll hand it over to Dr. Paul Ibbett to discuss our PRAME-TCR iNKT program."",
  ""We are excited to present our PRAME-targeted-TCR iNKT cell therapy at SITC last week."",
  ""This next-generation, allogeneic, off-the-shelf therapy offers a gene-editing-free approach that can be administered without lymphodepletion or GvHD to overcome the limitations of conventional T cell therapies in PRAME-positive solid tumors like non-small cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer, melanoma and sarcoma."",
  ""Our preclinical studies showed the PRAME-TCR-iNKTs are highly scalable, exhibit precise and potent , Jen."",
  ""MiNK ended the quarter with a cash balance of $6.3 million, reflecting cash used in operations for the three and nine months ended September 20 24 of $3 million and $7.8 million, respectively."",
  ""This is significantly reduced from cash used in operations of $7.8 million and $12.7 million for the same periods in 2023."",
  ""Net loss for the three and nine months ended, September 30, 2024 was $1.8 million or $0.05 per share and $8.3 million or $0.22 per share, respectively."",
  ""This compares to $5.1 million or $0.15 per share and $17 million or $0.50 per share for the same period in 2023."",
  ""I will now turn the call back over to the operator for questions.""

  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""I guess, first one, maybe just comment on how enrollment has been going in the Phase 2 gastric study relative to your internal expectations."",
  ""And kind of frame how we should be thinking about the data update in early 2025 in terms of how many patients we might see and what kind of endpoints you might release."",
  ""And maybe just on the financial side, for R&D expenses, it looks like that's been declining quite significantly this year."",
  ""What are the main factors that are driving that and what are you kind of prioritizing on the R&D front right now?"",
  ""Emily,  very much for your call and your questions and continued support."",
  ""And the gastric trial is, of course, progressing relatively rapidly, I would say."",
  ""And this is a second line setting and patients are getting multiple -- a combination of multiple agents, which is first of its kind."",
  ""And we started out by doing – conducting an induction period with the cells alone and then adding in the combination with BOT/BAL and subsequently standard of care chemotherapy."",
  ""We're close to halfway done with enrollment at this point."",
  ""And given that we started essentially in the end of the first quarter of 2024, we have some patients that have quite a bit of mature data."",
  ""So, we will be looking forward to some informative update of the upcoming conference that'll take place early in 2025."",
  ""And I'll leave it there because it is an IST and the data and the presentation will be in the hands of Dr. Yelena Janjigian and her team."",
  ""But we're quite enthusiastic about some of the observations that we're seeing to date, not only with our clinical activity but also with tolerability in that type of a combination which in the setting of second line gastric cancer, there is nothing for these patients."",
  ""So, to have something that actually can have disease-modulating properties and on top of standard of care is quite exciting for us."",
  ""So, more to come on this."",
  ""And so we'll give an update at the trial that will also give you insights into where we are with enrollment and where we will be by midyear next year."",
  ""Regarding the R&D expenses, you're right, and we've been doing an immense amount of work to really maximize our efficiencies that we have internally."",
  ""And part of that is scalability and manufacturing."",
  ""So, with the donor-derived product, we have a couple of obligations which include accessing the donor and then conducting viral testing for regulatory purposes to ensure clearance."",
  ""And those are somewhat costly."",
  ""What we've been able to do with our manufacturing now is to really exploit and exponentiate the scalability with a single donor."",
  ""So, we've really reduced our cost of starting material for cell manufacturing right now, and that's made an enormous impact financially for us."",
  ""So, while we continue R&D activities, we're advancing our MiNK-215 program towards IND."",
  ""And we're also continuing as you've seen from the SITC posters, new innovations in our pipeline that address areas of unmet need."",
  ""We are also reducing costs associated with our operational expenses and particularly giving our manufacturing innovation."",
  ""That's where we're having the highest return for our scientific endeavors."",
  ""Hi, So, we're continuing to advance on the design to get this trial through the activation period and into a first-in-man which we plan to do next year."",
  ""So when we look at this intended target population which is now patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with elevated risk factors for acute GvHD."",
  ""The eligibility will include patients that receive allogeneic stem cells with identified risk markers to ensure organ function, minimal active infections at the end of treatment."",
  ""When you look at the landscape of trials here, the intended patient population is very similar to this."",
  ""There aren't very many therapies at this point."",
  ""Patients are predominantly managed with standard of care corticosteroids."",
  ""Some patients will get abatacept, some patients will get Jakafi, but to a much lesser extent, and still more than half of those patients will progress to acute GvHD, which is incredibly problematic in this patient population."",
  ""So, from the design of this program, we are going to really and based on that mechanism of action of these cells, look to mitigate not only improving ."",
  ""And  all again for your continued support."",
  ""Looking forward to our next call.""

  ""Our earnings press release and financial statements for the third quarter of 2024 have been filed with the SEC and links to both can be found on our website, www.lftdpartners.com."",
  ""On today's call, we'll answer some – we shall share some comments on our quarterly performance and we will answer some questions at the end of the call."",
  ""A replay of this call will be available for an extended period of time, accessible through the Investors section of our website."",
  ""Here's the Safe Harbor notice."",
  ""Some of the statements that we will make today regarding our business operations and financial performance, including words such as may, might, would, should, could, potentially, hope, believe, expect, project and similar verbiage are forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially."",
  ""The listeners should not place undue reliance upon such statements."",
  ""For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in our most recent Form 10-K filed with the SEC."",
  ""We undertake no obligation to update these forward-looking statements."",
  ""During Q3, we welcomed Sharial Howard to our Board of Directors."",
  ""Sharial is an accomplished real estate professional who has worked closely for years with our board member, Kevin Rocio."",
  ""We look forward to working with Sharial to grow our company."",
  ""We will be holding a Shareholders' Meeting on December 6 in Orlando to vote on the election of our board of directors and to vote on the engagement of our outside auditing firm, Fruci & Associates."",
  ""By now, all of our shareholders should have received by mail our proxy materials."",
  ""Any shareholders who have not received our proxy materials because their addresses on file with our transfer agent are out of date should promptly contact our transfer agent, which is Colonial Stock Transfer in Salt Lake City."",
  ""I encourage all shareholders to participate in the vote."",
  ""Now, I'd like to address a few topics that have impacted our business over the past few months."",
  ""First of all, consumers nationally have been reducing their spending on discretionary items, including hemp-derived cannabinoid products."",
  ""Nick is going to comment on some important initiatives that he and his team at Lifted Made have been working on during this challenging sales environment to grow Urb's direct-to-consumer sales and direct-to-retailer sales, to expand sales of our Rebel Energy Gummies and Mielos wellness gummies, and to reduce our operating expenses."",
  ""Secondly, opponents led by the big marijuana companies are continuing to lobby at both the federal and state levels for prohibitions and/or severe restrictions against hemp-derived cannabinoid products."",
  ""Our company and other members of the hemp industry have been spending a great deal of time, energy and money attempting to persuade legislators to support regulatory guardrails that would prohibit sales of intoxicating hemp-derived cannabinoid products to minors, that would prohibit packaging intended to appeal to minors, and that would require rigorous lab testing of all products."",
  ""Third, we are in serious discussions with certain potential acquisition candidates that sell both hemp-derived and non-hemp-derived products."",
  ""One of these potential acquisition candidates is also involved in the US marijuana industry and it is expanding into the European Union."",
  ""We are actively exploring potential capital raises to fund such potential acquisitions, including using debt or equity, or a combination of the two."",
  ""We are subject to non-disclosure agreements so I'm not in a position to provide much more detail at this point in time."",
  ""While these potential acquisitions are extremely high priority for us, I must caution that no assurance can be given that these discussions will be successfully concluded."",
  ""At this point in time, I'll turn the presentation over to Nick Warrender, our Vice Chairman and Chief Operations Officer, and the Founder and CEO of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Lifted Made."",
  ""I'd like to provide information regarding some exciting developments and updates regarding Lifted."",
  ""During Q3, we launched the newest iteration of our bestselling flagship brand, Urb, featuring a Fly High theme."",
  ""We're using two major initiatives to intensively push these relaunched products in a way that is intended to significantly increase our direct-to-retailer and direct-to-consumer online sales."",
  ""To increase our direct-to-retailer sales, we've built a 15-person team of boots on the ground who have been meeting face-to-face with hundreds of vape shops and an intensive city-by-city push."",
  ""So far, our team has spent time in Houston, Dallas, Austin, Atlanta, and we'll be continuing on to other metro areas."",
  ""To increase our direct-to-consumer online sales, we've engaged some of the country's best online marketing firms to accelerate Urb's SEO and other online marketing efforts."",
  ""We're hopeful that these two major marketing initiatives will significantly expand our sales volumes and profit margins, and make us less reliant on current distributors."",
  ""We're also spending time, energy and money on marketing two of our new hemp-free brands, Mielos and Rebel Energy Gummies."",
  ""These two non-hemp brands are very important for Lifted because many large grocery and convenience store chains are not equipped or interested in handling product SKUs that are illegal in some of the states."",
  ""They want products that can be brought into their distribution centers and shipped all over the country without worrying about violating state and local laws."",
  ""We expect our marketing efforts on Mielos and Rebel Energy Gummies will gain traction during the holiday season from giving through the New Year, which is historically a very busy season for our products."",
  ""We've also been focused on reducing expenses."",
  ""We've reduced our payroll expenses 8% from Q1 2024 to Q2 2024, and then reduced our payroll expense another 8% from Q2 to Q3 2024."",
  ""Professional fee expenses also came down 40% from Q1 to Q2 2024 and then another 33% from Q2 to Q3."",
  ""And we have been – proactively reduced our CapEx spending from $747,000 in the prior year to $310,000 year-to-date and are containing our CapEx spending going forward."",
  ""As a result of these initiatives, our cash from operating activities only fell by $68,000 year-to-date and nearly all of our decline in cash was due to investing and financing activities."",
  ""At this point, I will turn the presentation over to Jake Jacobs, our President and Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""My comments will be based on quarter-over-quarter comparisons of the third quarter of 2024 to the third quarter of 2023 unless I state otherwise."",
  ""Our consolidated net sales were $8.6 million, down 34% due to a number of headwinds."",
  ""Firstly, prohibition of or tighter regulation of intoxicating hemp-derived products has been adopted or proposed in many states that are significant markets for LFTD such as in California."",
  ""Consumers are economically stressed and has been selectively reducing their discretionary spending."",
  ""There is also greater competition in the marketplace for branded, hemp- derived and psychoactive products that are similar to those that LFTD sells."",
  ""More distributors are creating their own brands and selling their own branded products at low prices."",
  ""There's increased competition for products containing more milligrams of cannabinoids or active ingredients per unit at a lower price point, and other competing brands are paying distributors and wholesalers more than what LFTD is willing to pay for valuable shelf space."",
  ""Our total cost of goods sold was $4.9 million, down 43%."",
  ""LFTD industry and customer preferences are constantly and quickly evolving."",
  ""Consequently, LFTD finds it extremely difficult to predict future sales of its products and to anticipate raw goods needs for future production."",
  ""This exposes LFTD to the risk that it will need to write off obsolete raw goods, causing an increase in cost of goods sold."",
  ""Written off inventory decreased to $330,000 compared to $597,000."",
  ""Excluding the effect of written off inventory, gross margin as a percentage of net sales was 47% compared to 38%."",
  ""Operating expenses were $3.9 million, up 4%."",
  ""The primary driver for this increase in operating expenses was $864,000 of bad debt expense."",
  ""The delay in LFTD's receipt of payments from certain customers, primarily distributors, have increasingly become an issue for LFTD."",
  ""Certain customers have become slower to pay LFTD for purchased products and these slow-paying customers disregard payment terms."",
  ""Management speculates that some slow-paying customers may be slow paying LFTD because of their own sales collection issues which may in part be caused by the regulatory uncertainty over our industry."",
  ""The company has an accounting protocol which effectively causes the company to recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts for all invoices older than 90 days."",
  ""Consequently, the delay in LFTD's receipt of payments from certain customers has a direct impact on the company's net receivables, net income and earnings per share."",
  ""Operating loss was $141,000 compared to operating income of $659,000."",
  ""Net other expenses were $48,000 compared to $80,000."",
  ""LFTD Partners' net loss was $194,000 or $0.01 per share compared to income of $617,000 or $0.04 per share."",
  ""Basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the quarter were 14.8 million shares."",
  ""During the nine months ended September 30, 2024, net cash used in operating activities was $67,000."",
  ""At September 30, 2024, we had total outstanding vested and exercisable options and warrants of 3.5 million with a weighted average exercise price of $3.97, which, if all were exercised, would generate proceeds of $13.7 million, ignoring any cashless exercise features."",
  ""In regards to our September 30, 2024 balance sheet compared to our December 31, 2023 balance sheet, cash on hand, which includes $1 million of restricted cash, decreased 22% to $4.1 million, down from $5.3 million."",
  ""Inventory decreased 4% to $9.7 million, down from $10.1 million."",
  ""Current assets decreased 19% to $17.4 million, down from $21.6 million."",
  ""Current ratio increased to 2.64 from 2.49."",
  ""Working capital decreased 16% to $10.8 million, down from $12.9 million, and notes payable to Surety Bank decreased 10% to $3.48 million, down from $3.85 million."",
  ""We will now answer questions that have been submitted to us.""
]","[
  ""I mean, we've got a board of directors that is, in our opinion, hanging in, in a very challenging environment in our industry with a lot of regulatory risk, a lot of issues that companies like ours are having to negotiate, and they're doing it in the context also of a very litigious industry and doing it in a context where it's impossible to get directors and officers insurance."",
  ""In our opinion at this point in time, $4,000 per quarter for independent directors functioning in this environment is very reasonable, and when you look at our filings, it's not like we've been issuing warrants or options to the directors on top of these very modest fees."",
  ""I realize reasonable people may differ on this point, but in management's opinion, these quarterly fees being paid to the directors are very, very reasonable in this environment."",
  ""And we've... Hey, Nick... Can you guys hear me?"",
  ""Two and a half years ago, we didn't face the regulatory uncertainty that we've been facing in the last two years."",
  ""I'd like to think we've done a great job in certain states proposing proper regulations to not only stabilize the industry but create a fair playing field, which I believe works to our advantage."",
  ""We've always focused on doing things the right way, doing things the compliant way rather than the easy path."",
  ""So, for us, it's – it has been a fight."",
  ""We've been extremely engaged in both the federal and on a state-by-state basis in protecting this industry, while simultaneously there's been mass amounts of saturation, economic impact for your average consumer."",
  ""And that's the reason why we have taken a new approach to really focusing on direct-to-retail and direct-to-consumer, as well as spending a lot of time, energy and money in expanding outside of hemp to where we can leverage our current infrastructure to do so."",
  ""These things take time, but we're working harder than we ever have and I realize that the results aren't as great as I believe everybody would like to see."",
  ""But we are optimistic based on the work that we have put in and understand that we need to change to get a different outcome."",
  ""And we've been making those changes over the last year to position ourselves to continue to tackle this industry but to also expand outside of it."",
  ""I mean, if you look at our industry, our company has performed at a very high end of the performance of companies in the cannabis industry."",
  ""Without any exaggeration, 95% of the companies in the cannabis industry, the publicly traded companies have been for years hemorrhaging millions, if not hundreds of millions of dollars."",
  ""I mean, billions of dollars of investor money have been lost by these companies and those companies typically pay significantly higher executive compensation than our business."",
  ""I mean, the CEOs of – some of our competitors have paid millions of dollars to their CEOs who have – who have had been leading companies that have been, like I said, losing insane amounts of money."",
  ""A $250,000 salary for our CEO, my salary, is drastically less than what these other money-losing competitors are doing, and same thing in the case of Nick and Jake."",
  ""I encourage any shareholder who is concerned about executive compensation to do some sort of comparison on your own between what we pay, which is extremely modest relative to the compensation being paid by our competitors, and our results have been significantly better than 95% of the industry."",
  ""I mean, at this point, our entire board is just up to our necks in terms of the complexities and interaction with the cannabis industry, both marijuana and hemp."",
  ""We have to be in order to be constantly reacting to the – all of the – all the moving pieces in this industry, both regulatory, competitor movements, as well as making sure that our company is continuing to operate in a completely legal fashion."",
  ""There is a requirement for independent board members that they have to be independent of the industry."",
  ""So, by definition, our independent board members have principal businesses that are outside the cannabis industry."",
  ""But, at this point, because of everything we've been going through since we acquired Lifted, all of our board members – Sharial has just joined within the last couple of months, but other than Sharial, the remainder of our board members have been educated by participating in the industry dramatically in terms of going – what's going on in both marijuana and hemp."",
  ""Well, I mean, Pablo has raised a number of different points."",
  ""I'll try to walk through some of them."",
  ""In terms of Ablis, which is a company in Oregon that we own 4.9% of that has CBD beverage products and is now launching into THC beverages, those folks have navigated, just like we have, an extremely difficult set of industry challenges, competitors, as well as challenges on the retailing side of – dealing with retailers that have a great deal of anxiety branching into THC products, which are controversial."",
  ""We have a lot of confidence in Jim Bendis, who's the Founder and CEO of Bendistillery and the principal owner of Ablis."",
  ""We have had conversations from time to time with Jim about the potential of Ablis and/or Bendistillery merging with us."",
  ""To this point, there is a mutual consensus in terms of how a transaction, a merger might occur and under what valuation and so forth."",
  ""But that is a potential down the road."",
  ""Not speaking for Jim, but we think that that's a potential."",
  ""I'm on the board of Bendistillery and Ablis."",
  ""We're closely monitoring what they're doing."",
  ""We like what they're doing."",
  ""We're optimistic about Ablis' growth and the people that they have."",
  ""But where that eventually ends up, if we were to have a larger stake, that remains to be seen."",
  ""It has been discussed from time to time, but no decisions or mutual agreement to do anything further are in place at this point in time."",
  ""In terms of the question that Pablo raised in terms of sales of edibles as compared to sales of vapes, I mean, I believe that there are reasons why consumers have migrated towards edibles and away from vapes."",
  ""Some of it, I think, relates to the ease of using gummies and edibles."",
  ""Also, it eliminates safety issues that some people have experienced not with our vapes but with some other company's vapes."",
  ""So there are safety concerns."",
  ""But both channels, edibles, gummies and vapes, are still very vibrant sales opportunities that LFTD that has."",
  ""Both of them are significant."",
  ""Nick, do you care to make any additional comments on this?"",
  ""Minnesota's a great example to look at where that was a market that we've captured a lot of market share over the years."",
  ""But with the shift in regulations that basically banned vapes but opened up limited milligram caps for beverages and edibles, really over this year, we've continued to expand in capturing more market share for the edible category in Minnesota, which has been rather drastic."",
  ""And we're seeing that in other states as well, right, Iowa being another state."",
  ""So there are states that just due to newly implemented regulations either limit or ban vapes entirely while edibles are still a category that's open."",
  ""We are continuing to explore a lot of tech in beverage."",
  ""It's something that we're actively pursuing and participating in, but we're – we believe edibles are here to stay, even in states where there's extremely tight regulations."",
  ""And then Pablo raised in last question in terms of as with Republicans controlling the Senate, does that change the calculus or the thinking about the Farm Bill – extension of the Farm Bill?"",
  ""Nick, I guess you'd probably be the best person to answer that."",
  ""We've worked close with a lot of Republican states over the last few years, so our relationships have expanded."",
  ""But this has been a bipartisan issue in our perspective of really working with both sides."",
  ""And so for us, it's important to protect the industry through sensible regulations."",
  ""We're excited to work with the new administrations and continue to push forward in legitimizing the hemp industry and protecting consumers simultaneously."",
  ""Gerry, you want to take this one?"",
  ""The second question we have is, revenues have now decreased over 50% from their high 2.5 years ago."",
  ""What is the plan to turn around the company?"",
  ""Nick, do you want to take this one?"",
  ""The next question is, what about reducing the compensation to the three highest compensated officers?"",
  ""What percentage of current board, besides Nick and his father, have any experience in the hemp or marijuana industry?"",
  ""The next question we have is from Pablo Zuanic from Zuanic & Associates."",
  ""Is there interest in increasing the equity stake 5% in Ablis hemp beverages?"",
  ""Can they explain, despite the market pressures, your sales of edibles continue to increase, can you give Okay."",
  ""Looks like there aren't any other questions."",
  ""This concludes today's – right?"",
  ""Let me just make sure."",
  ""This concludes today's conference and you may disconnect at this time.""

  ""As you are likely aware by now, on October 29, we sold our Pioneer Custom Electrical Products, PCEP, business unit, whose primary product line is the E-Bloc integrated power system, to Mill Point Capital, a New York-based private equity group for $50 million in a cash and equity transaction."",
  ""More specifically, Pioneer received approximately $48 million in cash proceeds from the sale and in addition received an approximately 6% equity stake in Mill Point's new Voltaris electrical products platform."",
  ""Concurrently, with the purchase of our E-Bloc business, Mill Point also purchased the Jefferson Electric dry-type transformer business from ERMCO as part of its efforts to build Voltaris into a significant provider of power solutions supporting the generational energy transition going on in the United States right now."",
  ""We expect the E-Bloc business to continue to grow rapidly and profitably as part of Voltaris, and we are pleased to be original equity owners of this platform."",
  ""Finally, on November 14, we announced that Pioneer's board of directors declared a onetime special cash dividend of $1.50 per share to be paid on January 7, 2025 to shareholders of record as of December 17, 2024."",
  ""Our Critical Power business is the sole operating business unit that remains in Pioneer after the sale to Mill Point and will indeed be the focus of our prepared remarks."",
  ""This business is anchored by our e-Boost Mobile charging platform, first introduced in November 2021, in addition, related service revenue and some traditional onsite and mobile power sales."",
  ""During the third quarter of 2024, this business delivered outstanding year-over-year revenue growth of 130% and generated positive operating income for the first time since the introduction of the e-Boost platform in November of 2021."",
  ""As of the end of the third quarter, our Critical Power segment, inclusive of e-Boost, had a total backlog of approximately $24 million, an increase of about 45% compared to the year-end 2023."",
  ""And in fact, this backlog provides the basis for our revenue guidance for 2025."",
  ""What began with one truck-mounted fast-charging solution in November 2021 has evolved into a 2024 revenue projected at $20 million-plus for this year, a high-growth business unit."",
  ""Product scope expansion over the last three-plus years have taken that single truck-mounted unit and spawned e-Boost Mini, a skid-based DC fast-charging solution that can be moved utilizing usually a forklift; e-Boost Mobile, the most prominent and the most active of the e-Boost platform are trailer based; DC fast-charging solution that could be pulled by a truck or tractor; e-Boost GOAT, a truck-integrated, DC fast-charging, EV charging solution that invokes the AAA model; and finally, e-Boost Pod, a DC fast-charging system integrated into a shipping container for rural, extreme weather regions and/or semi-permanent applications."",
  ""With each of these solution, we have proven our ability to innovate and address a rapidly evolving market and to customize our units electrically and/or mechanically to suit the needs of our diverse base of users."",
  ""e-Boost has become synonymous in the industry for reliable and sustainably powered off-grid mobile EV charging solutions."",
  ""To date, e-Boost has delivered over 20,000 unique vehicle charging sessions and over 400 megawatts of sustainable off-grid power."",
  ""Innovation has not been limited to product design either."",
  ""In August this year, we announced a groundbreaking collaboration with SparkCharge, the original and to-date the largest charging-as-a-service provider in the United States."",
  ""Through this collaboration, we aim to drive wider adoption of mobile EV charging, integrating battery energy storage with our e-Boost system and SparkCharge's mobile battery energy storage systems."",
  ""Together, we believe we can unlock new value in the mobile EV charging market and accelerate technological advancements as we work towards economical and scalable net zero charging solutions."",
  ""Since August, we have delivered two e-Boost units to SparkCharge and expect to deliver approximately 10 more e-Boost units in 2025."",
  ""In addition, we have identified tremendous opportunities for growth across a variety of vertical markets and diverse use cases, including bus fleets, ports, airports, municipalities and utilities that are proceeding with the electrification of their vehicle fleets."",
  ""We continue to believe the opportunities for growing our eMobility business are massive."",
  ""And with proceeds from the sale of PCEP and zero debt, we have the capital necessary to fund our growth plans over the next several years."",
  ""We are initiating guidance for 2025 of revenue between $27 million and $29 million."",
  ""As a result of the PCEP sale, we are a smaller business and will likely see some variability quarter-to-quarter."",
  ""However, looking across the full year of 2025, we are confident in our ability to meet this guidance."",
  ""We expect our revenue for 2025 to be primarily derived from sales and rental of our e-Boost product line, as well as service and maintenance of said equipment."",
  ""Breaking it down a bit further, we expect to generate approximately $17 million in revenue from the sale and rental of our equipment and approximately $10 million-plus from our service and maintenance business."",
  ""Of the approximately $17 million, we expect about $2.5 million to be the subject or be produced by longer-term lease/rental type agreements."",
  ""We remain committed to continually innovating to bring new products to the market and expand our streams of revenue for consistent longer-term growth."",
  ""To that point, we plan on launching our home e-Boost product in early 2025 through targeted regional distributors and dealers."",
  ""This product is our first solution focused on the residential and smaller commercial markets."",
  ""Home e-Boost addresses the resiliency needs of millions of homeowners across the United States during adverse climate events, which are now too common and frequent, and simultaneously addresses the growing need for EV charging at home, especially fast-charging and especially during power outages."",
  ""It was developed to run on existing natural gas lines, and unlike the majority of backup generators currently on the market that are designed to run for minimal or constricted hours per day and per year, it is powered by an EPA-rated prime engine that can operate 24/7."",
  ""This product line also includes a fast-charging option that can address the emerging demand for small businesses, minimal segment of the market, retail centers that can utilize the same solution to meet their business uptime needs and additionally provide EV charging to their customers."",
  ""We are deploying additional commercial resources to focus on and capitalize on this growing market."",
  ""Another dynamic market that has developed for us is the sale and rental of our e-Boost pure power units."",
  ""With the growth of large battery energy storage systems, BESS, and deployment of onsite hydrogen fueling station, there has been increasing demand for power, raw power, to recharge the battery units and to power the hydrogen reformers, where reliable and powerful grid connections are not available today or will in the near future."",
  ""e-Boost pure power offers large, quickly deployable, more sustainably powered units to support the onsite power needs for BESS and hydrogen customers."",
  ""We will be exploring additional application opportunities for our units as commercial enterprises, particularly businesses that do not have a massive electrical footprint, look to diversify away from a single, usually expensive utility connection, specifically, are marketing those power solutions to medical/dental type offices and facilities, small surgery centers, restaurants and the like."",
  ""Finally, in terms of strategic transactions, while there's nothing imminent, we plan to be opportunistic with any acquisitions that we might pursue."",
  ""We are looking primarily for sizable businesses with at least $25 million in revenue that are indeed complementary to our current e-Boost platform and would be immediately accretive to our earnings."",
  ""With that, I will turn the call over to Walter."",
  ""The call today will be hosted by Nathan Mazurek, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Walter Michalec, Chief Financial Officer; and Geo Murickan, President of Pioneer Power eMobility."",
  ""Following this discussion, there'll be a Q&A session open to participants on the call."",
  ""We appreciate the opportunity to review the third quarter financial results and recent business highlights."",
  ""Before we get started, let me remind you this call is being recorded and webcast."",
  ""During this call, management may make forward-looking statements."",
  ""These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially."",
  ""Please refer to the cautionary text regarding forward-looking statements contained in the  issued earlier today, which applies to the content of the call."",
  ""I'd like to now turn the call over to Nathan Mazurek, Chairman and CEO."",
  ""As Nathan mentioned earlier, on October 29, we successfully closed on the sale of our LA business, PCEP, for $50 million in a cash and equity transaction, primarily cash, as we received total gross cash proceeds of $48 million, leaving our balance sheet in a very strong position."",
  ""Our Critical Power business, which includes the e-Boost solutions, is the sole operating business unit that remains after the sale, so my prepared remarks only consider the continuing operations, excluding the results of the recently sold PCEP business."",
  ""Third quarter revenue for the Critical Power business segment was $6.4 million compared to $2.8 million in the year-ago quarter, an increase of approximately 130%."",
  ""The increase was primarily due to the growth in our e-Boost business."",
  ""Our Pioneer eMobility team was successful at delivering multiple e-Boost charging solutions to a customer in Canada, recognizing approximately $3 million in revenue during the third quarter from that contract alone."",
  ""To put this in perspective, revenue from our e-Boost business was approximately $1 million in total for all of 2023."",
  ""Third quarter gross profit for the Critical Power segment was $1.5 million, or a gross margin of approximately 24%, compared to gross profit of $439,000 or approximately 16% of revenue in the third quarter of last year."",
  ""The increase was once again due to the growth in our e-Boost business."",
  ""Just mentioned the $3 million e-Boost job that shipped during the third quarter."",
  ""Well, the extremely dedicated and hardworking team at Pioneer eMobility was successful at generating a blended gross margin of approximately 35% on that job."",
  ""This is roughly 10 percentage points higher than our historical target."",
  ""We continue to improve as a team, both in our sales and manufacturing efforts, and we expect that our margins will follow suit."",
  ""During the third quarter of 2024, our Critical Power segment generated operating income of $211,000 compared to generating an operating loss of $621,000 in the third quarter of last year."",
  ""The $832,000 improvement was primarily due to the large increase in revenue from the sale of our e-Boost solutions and the higher margins we are seeing from that business."",
  ""Lastly, given the sale of our PCEP business in October, we are updating our revenue guidance for 2024."",
  ""Now expect to recognize between $21 million and $23 million in revenue from continuing operations, and indeed also expect to generate significant operating income from the Critical Power segment during the fourth quarter of 2024."",
  ""As Nathan mentioned, in 2025, we expect to deliver revenue of $27 million to $29 million for the full year."",
  ""I will now turn the call back over to the operator for any questions.""
]","[
  ""Congratulations on all the progress."",
  ""You laid out some good color on the overall market, but I just want to get a little more detail on the demand drivers you're seeing."",
  ""Are there areas in 2025 that are starting to ramp?"",
  ""Are these customers sort of expanding their operations and these are refill orders at your current customer base?"",
  ""Or are there – how much is new customer wins?"",
  ""And just how do you sort of see the pipeline of activity and what we should watch for in terms of new activity coming through?"",
  "" for the color there."",
  ""And then on the kind of business model, I know you mentioned a couple different ways you're going about it to the market."",
  ""Do you have sort of a preference or do you see one developing?"",
  ""This is in terms of rental versus sort of a product sale."",
  ""Do you see that developing in one particular way or another?"",
  ""What's your sort of view on what you'd like the business to be?"",
  ""And then kind of last question's on your production capacity for the e-Boost business."",
  ""With all the changes, where are you at in terms of production capacity?"",
  ""Do you need to add more and what's your thinking there?"",
  ""Walter, Nathan,  for taking my questions and congrats on all the progress."",
  ""A very good color in the prepared remarks."",
  ""Actually, many of my questions were answered there."",
  ""But I do want to get into the – what you mentioned about the gross margins on the $3 million order that was delivered being closer to 35%."",
  ""Was that because of any particular – like was it a rental or a sale?"",
  ""Was there a service component to it?"",
  ""And should we expect those like similar levels of gross margins in the Understood."",
  ""And just sticking to sort of the customer diversity here, and you'd laid out the demand drivers based on Rob's question."",
  ""But in terms of the backlog of $24 million, how many customers are represented in it and what is the cadence?"",
  ""Like most of the time, I think it's $17 million of this is sales or rental, I think you mentioned, but the service and maintenance of Understood."",
  ""And then just one last one."",
  ""Of course, you probably will be sitting on $25 million to $30 million after January, I think, whenever... ...you distribute your dividend."",
  ""So, yeah, and you did mention your intention to – you're opportunistic on the M&A front."",
  ""Have you already identified potential customers like – or sorry, potential targets to acquire?"",
  ""May I squeeze one more on the SG&A front?"",
  ""It seems that like your segment SG&A was around $1 million for the business that you retain currently."",
  ""But I'm sure there must be some overhead that gets added on to it from the corporate overhead after the divestiture."",
  ""Do you have any like outlook on what level of SG&A or as a percent of revenue we should expect forward?"",
  ""Because... ...in the Q, you have laid it out for corporate, for the divested business and for the continuing business."",
  "" for that clarification and  for taking my questions."",
  ""I didn't break 2025 down in my own head percentage-wise, who's new, who's repeat, and by segment."",
  ""And Geo can chime in as well, maybe just if I finish the overall."",
  ""It's really all of it."",
  ""A lot of it is the segment that's being driven by government or quasi-government."",
  ""So, it's state, city, municipalities, both for electric buses moving the city buses, as we call them, or school bus related, however that particular purchase order comes to us."",
  ""Those are the big drivers."",
  ""And I guess, the group that's been very active, but – very active in trying to determine what they do going forward, but not so active in making final decisions on charging, is the package carriers."",
  ""So, the big alphas, the Amazons, FedEx, DHL, Postal Service, they've taken in a lot of electrical vehicles, vans, truck, every form, really have been big appetite for that, having made so many charging solutions choices."",
  ""And that's – we see that unfolding stronger for us in 2025, indeed, going into 2026."",
  ""Geo, you want to add or edit anything that I said?"",
  ""We'd like more lease/rental, whatever you want to call it."",
  ""We're budgeting Some of the package carriers, their orientation's the other way."",
  ""They want to lease everything that they can lease on that basis."",
  ""So, we see it going both ways."",
  ""So, if you use a hypothetical, would we engage in long-term leasing with Amazon?"",
  ""Would we do that with somebody who's starting as a startup, trying some sort of service charging business?"",
  ""So I mean, you're one of the few on the call, you've been to Champlin, so you have an idea."",
  ""So, we're trying to keep that sized on a steady basis."",
  ""All the prototyping, all the first articles on jobs, truly single or two-unit type that are very complicated and special, we're going to continue to do in Champlin and we don't have any reason to expand that particular site."",
  ""Outside of that, we've been working with a couple of subcontractors to expand capacity without really investing and having it as a fixed cost for ourselves."",
  ""So, we're beginning the first ones with one gentleman in Southern California."",
  ""The west, California and even Washington, Oregon, and those states are representing an outsized portion of projected 2025 revenue."",
  ""So, that's a huge pressure-relief device for what we need to do in Champlin."",
  ""And hopefully over the course of 2025, I'd love to develop a similarly well-suited and valuable economical partner on the eastern part of the United States."",
  ""So we don't have any plans to expand or take on any more facility than we do right now in Minneapolis."",
  ""So, that was a sale."",
  ""And frankly, I expected lower gross margins."",
  ""That was a very complicated set of units."",
  ""Rated for 40% below zero, all kinds of other features that they needed to have that we maybe didn't price so well from the – at the beginning."",
  ""But the team did an amazing job."",
  ""They also did an amazing job working with certain subcontractors, especially on the mechanical portion."",
  ""And those guys not only did it faster, but faster and more economically than we might have been able to do it."",
  ""And we were able to really do the final wiring and electrification of it, which is really where we have more valuable expertise and takes less time, so that we actually came in better than I expected."",
  ""Should we see that all the time?"",
  ""We should for that on the e-Boost sales all the time."",
  ""I think to the extent that the big variable cost has not been the material, we probably have been doing a little bit better on the material."",
  ""It's been predicting and budgeting the hours that it takes us to do and test and all the other special things that we do for all the units."",
  ""As we've gotten more experience, so we've gotten better at that, too."",
  ""And finally when we had, this was by far the largest quarter we've ever had, probably the largest single, Four is – I don't think we have anything like that."",
  ""That's way, way too out."",
  ""It's going to be one- to three-year type agreements, depends on the customer and so forth."",
  ""But the cadence is super strong."",
  ""But if you ask for – of the – what's comprising the backlog, without giving out the names, I'd say, the biggest single portion in the backlog is probably school bus related."",
  ""And then the second biggest broad category is going to be fleet related, whether it's a municipal's electric fleet, which includes anything and everything sometimes, or it's going to be a private fleet related, but that would be the single largest."",
  ""In a general way, yes."",
  ""I've done a little work on that."",
  ""We're not in a big rush."",
  ""We are and we aren't."",
  ""It has to be super compelling for us."",
  ""We can't – after everything that we've gone through, it can't be a cash drain on us."",
  ""It's got to be somewhat accretive."",
  ""It's got to be some redundancies and it's got to somehow enhance or we're getting more advanced technology that enhances what we're doing in a quicker way."",
  ""For overall, for the business, going into 2025, how we budgeted it?"",
  ""So, we do, I'll let Walter answer, so."",
  ""That's our goal every single day."",
  ""And based on what we're seeing and where we are on various proposals and negotiations, we're pretty confident for the next two years."",
  ""I mean, the largest bonus was to me, that was $2 million."",
  ""The rest was much less."",
  ""We had a $50-million sale."",
  ""I was the investment banker on it."",
  ""There was no investment banker, so there were no fees there."",
  ""Legal fees were very, very low in this case, because we have prior experience with Mill Point from five years ago, and that shortened that as well."",
  ""And the board decided that they felt that we had gotten a very, very high price for the business or a very fair price, and rewarded me as such."",
  ""I think you did cover most of it."",
  ""We do see, Rob, a more robust business coming from the municipalities segment and some related to utilities, as they are starting to ramp up the numerous different fleets that are electrifying within a city."",
  ""We expect to see some electrification on the sanitation side in terms of trash trucks and other things like that."",
  ""There's also a movement in the electrification of farm equipment and off-highway equipment, especially related to construction."",
  ""So, all of these movements we expect to start seeing as newer movements, as well as we shore up more transit and electric school bus orders."",
  ""Overall, we are going to seek to cut costs here at corporate."",
  ""We're expecting as a percentage of revenue at corporate for the overhead expenses to come in roughly 12% or so of revenue."",
  ""And as we scale and grow the Critical Power business, you mentioned that there might be some corporate overhead layered in there, that actually isn't."",
  ""So, the SG&A expense over at the Critical Power business will be somewhere around that $1-million mark."",
  ""And then, it all really just depends on how much R&D work we do.""

  ""On behalf of the management team and everyone here at BioRestorative, I'd like to  for your interest in our company."",
  ""And for those of you who are shareholders, we obviously appreciate your support."",
  ""As you can see from the press release that we issued earlier today, we continue to execute very well across all areas of our business in the third quarter."",
  ""As excited as we are about our financial and operating performance this quarter and the progress that we're making in our ThermoStem program, it was really the preliminary Phase 2 BRTX-100 data that we announced this morning that is most exciting with very encouraging data for 10 patients at 26 weeks and four patients at a year."",
  ""Accordingly, we're going to break with tradition a little here."",
  ""And rather than review our financial results, I'm going to ask Francisco to jump right into delivering the same BRTX-100 preliminary data slides that he gave today at ORS PSRS 7th International Spinal Research Symposium."",
  ""Of course, if you have any questions about the third quarter financial results or ThermoStem brown fat program or our commercial BioCosmeceuticals business, would be happy to answer them during the call's Q&A session as well."",
  ""I'll turn it over to Francisco now."",
  ""I think based on the investor profile on this call, it may be better to go right to kind of slide 17 and get to the punchline of the data."",
  ""I think a lot of people understand the environment as well as the product candidate."",
  ""Let's talk about the results."",
  ""That's really the most exciting part of it."",
  ""So, as you can see from what Francisco just reviewed, the blinded preliminary clinical data of safety and efficacy endpoints from the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of chronic lumbar disc disease are very encouraging with patient reported pain and function outcomes demonstrating a very clear and positive trend."",
  ""So, to summarize, at 26 weeks, like Francisco mentioned, 70% of the first 10 patients in the study reported a greater than 30% increase in function and a more than 30% decrease in pain."",
  ""Now, I want to highlight that while the 30% increase in function and decrease in pain have been set forth by the FDA as preliminary endpoints for efficacy, we find those to be somewhat low."",
  ""And we have demonstrated the ability to do far greater than those hurdles of 30%."",
  ""So, if you look at each of these patients individually, those that responded, they responded far better than the 30%, some going as high as close to 90% improvement in pain and function, and others circling around that sort of geography."",
  ""We're very optimistic about these results."",
  ""It really puts us in a position to continue with our enrollment, which we are – we continue to progress well, and we expect to complete before the end of 2024."",
  ""We know that if the data continues with this trend, we're confident that we will hit our efficacy endpoints for the Phase 2 trial."",
  ""And we will intend to present more of this data from the trial with an even larger patient population in the coming months."",
  ""I expect to be somewhere early next year, January and February with a larger group, both out to 52 weeks and 26 weeks."",
  ""Finally, from a financial perspective, I'd be remiss by not mentioning that we ended the third quarter in a very strong position with cash, cash equivalents and investments held in marketable securities, $13.1 million, with no outstanding debt."",
  ""That, combined with our steadily improving financial performance, provides us with additional financial flexibility and puts us on a path to profitability."",
  ""So,  very much for listening in."",
  ""That is – those are our concluding remarks as it pertains to our prepared script, and we're happy to take any questions that you may have."",
  ""Let me start by pointing out that this conference call will include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""All forward-looking statements are based on BioRestorative Therapies' current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, and such statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from those implied by such statements."",
  ""No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed."",
  ""For details on factors, among others, that could affect expectations, see Part I, Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023 as amended and Part II, Item 1A of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ended September 30, 2024, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission."",
  ""Listeners are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this conference call."",
  ""BioRestorative undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, other than as required by law."",
  ""On the call representing the company are Lance Alstodt, BioRestorative's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Francisco Silva, its Vice President of Research and Development; and Robert Kristal, the company's Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""With that said, I'll now turn the call over to Lance."",
  ""So, our lead cell therapy candidate is BRTX-100."",
  ""It's a novel cell-based therapeutic engineered to target areas of the body that have little blood flow and oxygen content."",
  ""The product is formulated using autologous or your own cultured mesenchymal stem cells collected from the patient's bone marrow, as well as platelet lysate that's collected from the patient's blood."",
  ""We intend that the product will be used for the non-surgical treatment of painful lumbosacral disc disorders or as a complementary therapeutic to a surgical procedure."",
  ""The safety and efficacy data of BRTX-100 in treating chronic lumbar disc disease, or CLDD is being evaluated in an ongoing Phase 2 prospective randomized, double-blinded and sham-controlled study."",
  ""A total of up to 99 eligible subjects will be enrolled at up to 16 clinical sites across the United States, and subjects who are included in the trial will be randomized 2:1 to receive either BRTX-100 or placebo with the sham-controlled."",
  ""As Lance mentioned, I'm please to review the same slides that I discussed earlier today at our podium presentation at the ORS Spine Meeting."",
  ""And so, to go through the slide deck, I'm just going to quickly jump through some of the slides."",
  ""Obviously, we have our boilerplate forward-looking statements."",
  ""And on slide 3, just want to quickly review the disc microenvironment, which is really important in understanding the impact of the product, the way it's been designed and engineered, because it's really targeting the harsh microenvironment that's found within the disc."",
  ""It has a very high osmolarity."",
  ""It has very low oxygen tension of about 2%."",
  ""Lactate levels are also low and pH which is extremely detrimental to cells."",
  ""So, this is important, because when you're developing a biologic and you're trying to remodel the disc, especially within the nucleus pulposus, if you put cells in there that are not acclimated to this harsh environment, you're going to have a lot of cell death that could potentially cause the patient to experience worsening symptoms of the treatment or the treatment might not work at all, because the cells need to be alive for them to actually perform their anti-inflammatory activities."",
  ""So, really understanding the microenvironment is critical when developing a product, and that's what we have done over the last couple of years in developing our BRTX-100 product."",
  ""So, in the microenvironment, as a healthy disc degenerates – let me go back, sorry."",
  ""As a healthy disc degenerates – something is – sorry, guys, but this is moving a little bit different."",
  ""So, let's go to slide number 17."",
  ""And in slide number 17 is the total of 10 patients that are treated using the product BRTX-100."",
  ""And in this particular group of patients that have been treated, you could see a direct correlation that at 26 weeks, 70% of the patients – again, this is blinded but very, very encouraging – 70% of the patients had an improvement in both pain, as well as function measured by the VAS and the ODI."",
  ""So, seven of the 10 improved and three of the patients did not hit the benchmark of 30% improvement, which is dictated by the FDA as being efficacious."",
  ""So, that's very encouraging from the point of view of seeing that the data is falling in line within the randomization of the patients treated."",
  ""And we expect that this trend will continue to grow as the patients move on from the 26-week endpoint to the 52-week endpoint."",
  ""And again, this is true as you review some of the other scales that we use for patient reported outcomes, which is – another one is the RMDQ, which is also showing a decrease in time in patients that have been treated or treated with the clinical protocol in terms of either being in the sham or the treatment group, as well as the FRI, which is another scale that is used to determine efficacy."",
  ""You see very similar trends in terms of the patient profile decreasing once the patients are enrolled in the trial."",
  ""So, to summarize, what we found is that very early, we're seeing very strong safety signals."",
  ""So, we have not experienced to date any severe adverse event or dose-limiting toxicity, our current dose of 40 million cells injected intradiscally."",
  ""So, this is very, very encouraging and this is our primary endpoint in terms of safety."",
  ""So, we feel very strong that this is going to continue throughout the trial."",
  ""More importantly is the efficacy, which is we're starting to see very strong trends emerge in both the VAS and the ODI showing significance compared to baseline."",
  ""And there's a responder rate that is also beginning to form now with the additional data that we're seeing that seven of the 10 patients met the preliminary efficacy endpoints of improving by both 30% in pain and function."",
  ""Another item that we're very encouraged about, because we're starting to see a lot of this positive data emerge is that we're contemplating a 26-week preliminary efficacy endpoint interim analysis."",
  ""So, that's something that's on the horizon for us."",
  ""In addition to that, we're looking to expand the product profile and indication of BRTX-100 to include cervical indications.""
]","[
  ""Congrats and  for sharing that data."",
  ""How many patients are enrolled thus far?"",
  ""Is it – are you only comfortable saying some number north of 10?"",
  ""So, when was that data cut, the two weeks, because when you show two weeks, it kind of makes someone think that there is not that many more than 10, because it's just two-week old data?"",
  ""So, when was that cut?"",
  ""So, now I can see why you're still sticking with 99 by year-end 2024."",
  ""When we see – when will we see the first unblinded data?"",
  ""Do you intend to come out with additional 26-week and 52-week data still on a blinded basis, or will we see it unblinded the next time?"",
  ""And you can't postulate when that unblinded 26-week look – interim look might occur?"",
  ""So, do you think the fourth patient that behaved like the other three, that back in February of this year, it was three versus one, and that was the split you were talking about."",
  ""Do you think that fourth patient, the saline they got just eventually started to work and that's why you have four 52 weeks versus the clear line between three and four last February?"",
  ""Can we be confident... No."",
  ""Can we be confident that the two placebos to be represented two of the six extra patients that turned four into 10, did they both get shams or perhaps did they get salines as well?"",
  ""That is... That's very helpful."",
  ""Rob, how long do you think $13 million last?"",
  "" so much for taking my questions and congrats on the really interesting data."",
  ""I guess, to kick things off and just follow up a little bit on the point you were talking about just before on the 52-week data where you saw all four patients respond."",
  ""Could you just give an idea of the magnitude of response for, I guess, patients one through three versus patient four, because I believe that's how it broke down at the prior interim blinded look where you had patients one, two and three responding significantly more than patient four."",
  ""And then, just, I guess more broadly, right, given what we have seen from the FDA seeming to be a bit more supportive of others in the cell therapy space, like we've seen with Capricor, Mesoblast, would it be possible that if you are able to achieve both pain and function in this study, could that be something that you could file for accelerated approval on?"",
  ""And then one last one for me, and I'll hop back in the queue."",
  ""Actually, that does lead somewhat into my next question."",
  ""I just wanted to ask you a little bit about some of the secondaries that you would be looking at in the final unblinded data."",
  ""And in particular, whether you will be looking at how the percent change from baseline varies between groups?"",
  ""Just for the actual final unblinded data in terms of secondary endpoints is something that you'll be looking at the percent change from baseline on both the pain and function scales for the different groups in addition to the responder analysis?"",
  ""And once again, congratulations on the compelling data here."",
  ""What I'd like to ask Lance, if you could remind us whether the pain improvement and the functional improvement are these co-primary endpoints."",
  ""And if that is so, would you have to demonstrate it at the group level, or would you have to demonstrate it within the same patient that they both would have to improve at least 30% on the VAS and at least 30% on the ODI for them to be called the responder?"",
  ""So, in the current study, you see, Francisco, that the seven out of 10 is the seven that responded?"",
  ""I mean, at the end of the day, if you were successful in both, that would make a story for a stronger argument for the product Yes."",
  ""It's considerably more than 10."",
  ""We have not talked about that publicly."",
  ""So, we'll continue to take that approach until we – as we continue to navigate the FDA on strategies of Fast Track and RMAT, et cetera."",
  ""I would... I would weigh in and commit to sometime in the first half of 2025."",
  ""But that's subject to further updates."",
  ""Only one patient received a saline injection."",
  ""Everyone else got the sham."",
  ""And then – and just to further your – to answer that as well, as you look at the 52-week data with the four patients, now we don't know which one have received the sham injection versus the BRTX-100, but there's considerable separation in the results, while all of them 100% achieved the 30%, it appears that one only achieved 30%, while the others achieved results far more significant than 30%."",
  ""So, we still see a separation there, and it's very possible that the placebo effect did take hold and the disc was further hydrated and lowered its pH and kind of maintained a healthier environment."",
  ""So, we can expect that, I guess, from time-to-time."",
  ""But to Francisco's point, the 26-week data, where we have the sham injection, those are a little bit more bifurcated between those that responded and those that did not, and it kind of matches up with the randomization of 2:1."",
  ""Well, I'll speak for Rob here."",
  ""But while we don't commit the timing, we don't anticipate having to do a financing anytime soon."",
  ""So, we have all the cash that we need to achieve our strategic goals and get to an answer within this trial."",
  ""And just to add to that, that's really important here is that keep in mind that we have not disclosed or released any MRI images of any of these patients."",
  ""So, that's something that's something to look forward to in terms of additional evidence of the remodeling that's happening within the disc."",
  ""And Elemer,  for your question."",
  ""I think I know where you're going, because there has been a bit of a change in thought within the agency and people are now looking at just pain as opposed to function as well."",
  ""It leaves us open strategically as we think about amending protocols as we go through this to really increase our probability of success by limiting it perhaps to just one factor such as pain, because we do believe that there's precedent for that out there now."",
  ""So, it's something that we're – we are discussing."",
  ""But as of now, the protocol is written for both pain and function."",
  ""And the good news for us is the responder group does clear that what we think is the minimal bar of 30% in both disciplines."",
  ""While also be showing some changes radiographically and improvement in the physics of the disc would be also very interesting and compelling, which we intend to do."",
  ""I would just say – this is Lance."",
  ""On behalf of our team, we really appreciate you following us and spending the time to get further clarity on our quarterly accomplishments and certainly your interest in our clinical data."",
  ""We will continue to update everyone as appropriate on new developments within our company, and we intend to have more data available in the January-February timeframe."",
  ""We're really excited to share with what we're working on."",
  ""So, have a great night and  again for your interest."",
  ""This data is several months old in terms of the two-week time point where some of the patients hit the two-week point."",
  ""So, yeah, we have more than 10-patient data."",
  ""Most of the patient data were – it'll be a lot more cumulative, will be presented at ORS in February."",
  ""No, it will still be blinded."",
  ""Again, this is an academic conference where we're presenting."",
  ""We have to be very careful how we present the data as well to maintain the blind."",
  ""So, that's something – even with the results are impressive and very encouraging from the point of view of the emerging responder rate."",
  ""But this is where we are so encouraged by the positive results is where we're looking at the possibility of an interim analysis at 26 weeks for the patients."",
  ""And I think that would be an appropriate time to have unblinded data where we have the sham versus the treatment group of BRTX-100."",
  ""I mean – again, I mean, it's all – we need to make sure we don't compromise the integrity of the trial."",
  ""There's a lot of logistics in terms of releasing, but if we were to do an interim analysis, it would be early next year."",
  ""And I think that's a great comment."",
  ""And I mean that's the beauty of a clinical trial is that if it's well-designed and the product is efficacious, you begin to see trends emerge."",
  ""And that one subject is part of that group."",
  ""We have – that was saline treated and it's very well known that saline does have therapeutic effects that are not long-term maintained, but they do impact the trial."",
  ""So, we're very happy that we were able to amend our protocol to have now a sham group."",
  ""And so, at the 26 weeks, this is where the sham patients are being recorded."",
  ""So, we expect that presenting 52-week data of these particular patients, you'll have a better delta and a better view in terms of what's happening."",
  ""But the 26-week data is... Go ahead."",
  ""And that trend is continuing."",
  ""Again, we have to be careful in terms of how we present this data."",
  ""We don't want to unblind, but the trend is continuing with one patient having some effect based on the randomization, but the other three patients are significantly lower, which is, again, the numbers range, but they're greater than 60% improvement compared to baseline."",
  ""I mean, it's something that it's – again, I mean, this is 10 patients, but the data is very encouraging considering what's been out there with either other clinical trials in the disc space or investigator-initiated studies."",
  ""So, we're very encouraged that this data, if it continues to show these effects that we could potentially use this data for pivotal, which would really help us and accelerate the commercialization of the product, which is, I think, really needed in terms of the overall market in the US in getting cell-based therapies approved, especially when you're looking at these musculoskeletal disorders, which are tremendous."",
  ""So, there's a huge market for it, and we're very confident with our product."",
  ""Michael, I'll also mention that because of what you just mentioned in the temperature at the FDA in terms of Can you repeat the question?"",
  ""I'm sorry, I didn't understand it."",
  ""So, the FDA has guided that it's a 30% change, is their MCID that they've put into our protocol."",
  ""We feel that we can exceed that based on the trending data points that are coming out."",
  ""So, we feel very strongly that we're going to not only hit the – our MCID in terms of efficacy, but we will be able to exceed that."",
  ""And we're also looking at radiographic endpoints and a whole host of other measures that we think would be just good general information for people to have to demonstrate that it's not just a subjective issue, but if we can demonstrate that there's radiographic improvement in the disc, that's a very powerful set of data."",
  ""They have to both respond in both the VAS, as well as the ODI to be labeled a responder.""

  ""The third quarter included several major events in the development of GeoVax, led by the BARDA Project NextGen award valued at almost $400 million being announced during mid-June."",
  ""This program is already underway with confirmation that all study sites have been selected, as well as our ongoing billings to BARDA."",
  ""Mark will further discuss this during the financial review."",
  ""We're delighted to have been paired by BARDA with Allucent as our CRO for the Project NextGen trial, as Allucent is our existing CRO supporting our ongoing CM04S1 and recently completed Gedeptin clinical trials."",
  ""In addition, during quarter three, we announced plans to conduct the Phase 2 trial of Gedeptin in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitor among patients with locally recurrent head and neck squamous cell carcinomas following primary therapy and for whom resection with curative intent is planned."",
  ""Thus far, clinical evaluation of Gedeptin therapy has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile and sufficient tumor stabilization or reduction activity to support plans to advance clinical development of Gedeptin in such an expanded Phase 2 clinical trial."",
  ""Relative to GEO-MVA, our vaccine candidate against Mpox and smallpox, we've continued to advance the program this past quarter from having the cGMP production of a Master Seed virus to establishing the working seed virus and currently having production of the first cGMP clinical substance batch underway with release anticipated by year-end."",
  ""In addition, we're moving forward with our advanced MVA manufacturing process with preparation of our AGE.1 master cell bank being initiated."",
  ""These activities represent significant progress and milestones for GeoVax."",
  ""Our goal is to successfully develop innovative cancer therapies and infectious disease vaccines, addressing critically important unmet medical needs, pursuing initial indications that support expedited registration pathways."",
  ""We anticipate establishing business partnerships and collaborations and support the worldwide development, commercialization, and distribution."",
  ""In late July, we announced plans to initiate a Phase 2 trial with Gedeptin in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor for treatment of previously treated patients with recurrent head and neck cancer."",
  ""The primary goal of this trial will be to demonstrate a pathological response with new adjuvant Gedeptin therapy, combined with an immune checkpoint inhibitor, in previously treated patients with recurrent squamous cell head and neck cancer in whom surgery with curative intent is planned."",
  ""The company has initiated the necessary planning activities, including protocol development, manufacturing, and CRO selection, with the trial activation anticipated during 2025."",
  ""We believe that the Gedeptin mechanism of action will enable us to address a variety of solid tumors, both cancerous and benign."",
  ""We hold worldwide rights for all indications of this technology, and we're participating in various oncology and partnering conferences."",
  ""We are encouraged by the clinical results we've seen thus far and we're even more excited about trial activation as soon as possible."",
  ""Our big news recently was the announcement of the BARDA Project NextGen award of almost $400 million, supporting GEO-CM04S1 in a 10,000-patient comparative trial against an FDA-authorized mRNA vaccine."",
  ""This represents a highly significant event in the evolution of our company, which we believe represents a validation of our MVA technology and expertise."",
  ""The vetting process was lengthy and rigorous, but we remained confident throughout, and we're delighted to be part of the Project NextGen Vaccine Program."",
  ""Let me note that our vaccine selection represents one of only six vaccines awarded on the Project NexGen."",
  ""Already, all participating sites have been identified, selected by Allucent in manufacturing activities or proceeding in support of the study start during 2025."",
  ""Our aim with CM04S1 is to provide a more practical, public health-friendly COVID-19 vaccine than that offered from the first generation approved vaccine."",
  ""We believe that this is achieved by stimulating a robust and durable immune response across multiple virus variants as a result of the induction of both the antibody and cellular arms of immune system against multiple virus antigens."",
  ""This distinction is critically important in addressing the high-risk populations of immune-compromised individuals for whom the current vaccines are often inadequate."",
  ""This represents the key differentiation between our vaccine and the first generation authorized vaccines."",
  ""Our vaccine utilizes a proven, safe, and efficient delivery platform, Modified Vaccinia Ankara or MVA, which does not replicate in mammalian cells."",
  ""The safety of MVA has been well-established and accepted by regulatory authorities worldwide, especially among patients with weakened immune systems, such as among pregnant women."",
  ""That, our vaccine platform, MVA, is also a standalone vaccine authorized for protection against Mpox and smallpox is a unique feature, which critically important clinical benefits, providing a significant differentiator for CM04S1, especially when considered as a potential COVID-19 vaccine in regions endemic to Mpox."",
  ""A current example is within the Democratic Republic of the Congo or the DRC, where there is a threatening outbreak underway."",
  ""Also, the CDC recently issued a warning of continued Mpox threats and risk within the US."",
  ""In addition to its benefits in immunocompromised individuals and protecting from severe COVID-19, we believe that CM04S1 has potential for more general use as a heterologous booster to current mRNA vaccines, providing a durable and broadly functional immune response against emerging variants."",
  ""The intriguing possibility is that GEO-CM04S1 could, by virtue of this immune profile, reduce the need for continuous vaccine reconfiguration that appears necessary with the mRNA vaccines."",
  ""In fact, the HHS press release announcing our Project NextGen award specifically highlighted our award as providing the potential for a COVID-19 vaccine that provides broader protection, meaning encompassing a wider variety of variants and the potential for increased durability than that evidenced by the current authorized vaccines."",
  ""The current data thus far from our existing Phase 2 studies is supportive of that potential."",
  ""Relative to CM04S1, we anticipate partnering collaborations in additional clinical and research efforts and in support of worldwide commercialization and distribution."",
  ""Active initiatives are underway in these areas."",
  ""Three Phase 2 clinical trials are underway with CM04S1, two of which address populations of immunocompromised patients at high risk for developing severe COVID-19."",
  ""The other Phase 2 trial evaluates our vaccine as a heterologous booster among healthy adults, following prior receipt of an mRNA vaccine."",
  ""Overall, we hope to demonstrate that our COVID-19 vaccine successfully addresses the current unmet needs among the tens of millions of immunocompromised patients, while also demonstrating the vaccine as a more robust, durable booster vaccine used in conjunction with mRNA vaccines."",
  ""I won't delve further into these specific trials at this time, but we welcome any questions you may have during our Q&A session."",
  ""With the announcement of our Project NextGen award and the progress in our other Phase 2 clinical studies, our activities related to partnering and collaborations with GEO-CM04S1 have increased."",
  ""We believe that GEO-CM04S1 represents significant promise as a critically needed and important part of the COVID-19 vaccine armamentarium for public health worldwide."",
  ""In August, the WHO declared Mpox as a public health emergency of international concern, highlighting the critical medical threat posed by this highly virulent virus."",
  ""GeoVax is well-positioned and actively progressing GEO-MVA, our vaccine against Mpox and smallpox, intended to disrupt the current global monopoly in that important area."",
  ""Moreover, we believe that our efforts will establish GeoVax as the first US-based supplier of such a vaccine."",
  ""This may also provide GeoVax our initial step into revenue generation to the significant governmental interest in US-based supply chains versus overdependence on non-US suppliers."",
  ""The strong sentiment in favor of such own sourcing initiatives remains a major national legislative focus and interest."",
  ""We remain in active discussions and briefings with various stakeholders, such as the White House, BARDA, WHO, the African CDC, and others regarding our progress towards having a cGMP clinical batch produced and manufacturing capabilities advancing."",
  ""WHO has clearly stated the expectation of continued expanded migration of the Mpox virus, reflected in recent reports of multiple cases in the UK."",
  ""The need for expanded Mpox vaccine supply is a priority for WHO and other public health agencies globally."",
  ""Finally, we anticipate providing continued updates related to our advanced MVA manufacturing process, targeted to enable GeoVax to efficiently produce and distribute MVA-based vaccines in response to real-time market needs."",
  ""We're confident that we're on a course that will build significant shareholder and stakeholder value, while delivering critically important differentiated products to improve lives worldwide."",
  ""From a commercial perspective, these medical need opportunities represent a tremendous estimated annual US revenue potential."",
  ""I'll underscore that this isn't a sales forecast, but rather reflection of the significance of the need to address these critically important areas of healthcare, both clinically and commercially."",
  ""Expanding this to a worldwide basis in conjunction with partners and collaborators adds to the confidence we have relative to the outlook for GeoVax, our shareholders, and our stakeholders."",
  ""Now, I'd like to turn the presentation over to Mark Reynolds, GeoVax's Chief Financial Officer for review of our recent results and financial stats."",
  ""My colleagues and I will now answer your questions."",
  ""Joining us for the Q&A session are Doctors Mark Newman, Kelly McKee, and John Sharkey, our Chief Scientific Officer, Chief Medical Officer, and Vice President of Business Development, respectively."",
  ""I'll now turn the call over to the operator for instructions on the question-and-answer period."",
  ""I'll start reviewing with the income statement to begin with."",
  ""Our contract with BARDA began on June 12, so there were minimal revenues reported during the second quarter."",
  ""During the third quarter ended September 30, we reported $2.8 million of revenues and $3.1 million for the nine-month period."",
  ""There were no comparable revenues reported during the 2023 periods."",
  ""This is a cost reimbursement contract, so future revenues will directly correlate with our billable personnel time and incremental expenses incurred."",
  ""The total contract value direct to GeoVax is currently $26 million, but may actually increase up to $45 million."",
  ""And keep in mind that a separate contract of $443 million was awarded directly to Allucent, the CRO that is conducting our trial."",
  ""Those revenues won't show up in our financial statements."",
  ""Research and development expenses were $16.1 million during the first nine months of 2024 versus $14.5 million in 2023, representing an increase of roughly $1.6 million or 11%."",
  ""This year-over-year increase is primarily associated with costs of manufacturing clinical trial materials and other costs associated with the BARDA contract."",
  ""General and administrative expenses were $3.8 million for the nine-month period in 2024 versus $4.6 million in 2023, representing a decrease of around $800,000 or 17%, primarily associated with lower stock-based compensation expense and a mix of other costs."",
  ""Other income and expense was $70,000 in 2024, as compared to $675,000 in 2023, primarily reflecting lower interest income due to lower cash balances invested through our money market accounts."",
  ""So, overall, net loss for the first nine months of 2024 was approximately $16.7 million or $4.52 per share versus $18.4 million in 2023 or $10.42 per share, again, with the increase primarily being driven by manufacturing activities and costs associated with the BARDA contract."",
  ""Turning now to the balance sheet, our cash balances at September 30 were $8.6 million compared to $6.5 million at December 31, 2023, reflective of $16.9 million used in operating activities, offset by $19.1 million in financing transactions, along with changes to our non-cash asset and liability balances."",
  ""Our outstanding common shares currently stand at 9.4 million following the recent financings."",
  ""Going forward, supporting the BARDA and that Project Next Gen award is our top priority in terms of operational focus and the significant use of our research and development personnel, but it's important to keep in mind that the entire clinical program is fully funded by BARDA through the awards to GeoVax and to Allucent, our CRO partner."",
  ""In terms of our actual funding needs, the Gedeptin and CM04S1 clinical programs, as well as the development activities for the GEO-MVA Mpox program, will be the most significant use of our cash for the foreseeable future."",
  ""We are currently developing our capital formation plans to fund those programs through several valuation inflection points."",
  ""I'll be happy to answer any further questions during the Q&A, and I'll now turn the call back to David.""
]","[
  ""I was curious regarding that AGE.1 cell line for MVA manufacturing, what must you do to submit test batches to the FDA to get to that point?"",
  ""And can you help us on that timing?"",
  ""David, when might – for both the CLL and the healthy volunteer trials, when would we be able to see interim and final results, respectively, for those two trials?"",
  ""And the last couple or just – have you made much progress and can you tell us the progress that you've made in your request for expedited regulatory pathway for Mpox?"",
  ""And then, I just saw nothing about when you'll start enrolling trial – patients in your 10,000-patient Phase 2 COVID trials."",
  ""Just hoping that was something that was at least going to start by the middle of 2025, but you gave no timing on that."",
  ""So, I was wondering when you could start enrolling those patients and the progress you made in expedited regulatory pathway for Mpox."",
  ""So, you wouldn't even have to do efficacy in animals?"",
  ""And just finally, the next-gen trial start timing?"",
  ""The – looking now past the fourth quarter here, what are the sort of the next steps we should anticipate here in early 2025 for the primary vaccine trial, the CLL trial, booster vaccine trial, all of which you're putting out data end of this year, early next?"",
  ""What kind of next steps we should anticipate?"",
  ""And where, let's say, sort of end game on each of those trials where you can go to the FDA and start talking about next steps or potentially in filing?"",
  ""And then on Mpox and smallpox, a few folks looking to get some vaccines together for disease, who do you see as sort of the clear leader yourselves, of course, in this space?"",
  ""And what do you think gets you to the finish line?"",
  ""Who didn't get to the finish line first there or do you think it's something where you'll need multiple vaccines, different populations, what have you?"",
  ""The last question Oh, just a – just as we're modeling on this, we sort of plug in about $3 million a quarter roughly going forward to run through the $26 million?"",
  ""I was thinking to the Pfizer putting $2.3 billion in the quarter of PAXLOVID and much as interest may waned from Wall Street on COVID and COVID hasn't gotten tired of us."",
  "" for taking the questions."",
  ""I'm just wondering if you've been watching the launch of PEMGARDA and what you think of that because it is – while it's not a traditional vaccine, it's a monoclonal antibody, it is targeting immunocompromised patients for COVID."",
  ""And are there any lessons to be learned from that?"",
  ""I think they could actually be complementary in a lot of ways."",
  ""You did a very good financing in August, particularly when you look at where the stock was then and where it is now."",
  ""One of the biggest challenges in the microcap world is financing."",
  ""Can you talk a little bit about what the strategy is to kind of get across the next 12 to 24 months, where it seems like you have multiple inflection points coming?"",
  "" so much for the update."",
  "" for taking my question and apologize for the graininess of this connection."",
  ""I just wanted to ask a question about R&D expenses."",
  ""What costs do you think you may continue to incur regarding manufacturing materials for the clinical trials with CM04S1 and the BARDA contract?"",
  ""And with Oxford Biomedica manufacturing supply for you, is that something where you – the manufacturer supply and then you pay them?"",
  ""What kind of accounting treatment is used there and what level of expenses do you incur there?"",
  ""Yeah, just to clarify those."",
  ""So, if you were to be paid – if you were to incur those expenses this month, you would be paid in December and not in January?"",
  ""I appreciate answering my questions and congrats on the process of – on progress."",
  ""Looking forward to the readouts in the coming weeks."",
  ""Just wanted to congratulate the whole team on all of the achievements that have been reported in the last quarter and just applaud the progress that you've made in the face of some really difficult times in the past."",
  ""My question has to do with Gedeptin and the mention in the press release that the Phase 2 will have a single cycle – will be a single cycle trial and pathological response rate will be the primary endpoint."",
  ""I was curious if you could expand a little bit about the treatment and whether a single cycle trial means single cycle of Gedeptin and standard dosing of the checkpoint inhibitor or one single cycle of each, and if there were any specific pathological response endpoints that you could share at this point?"",
  ""I wanted to ask – four of my questions have already been answered, but I wanted to ask."",
  ""With the durability because, obviously, immunocompromised patients we addressed this before, there's so many immunocompromised patients and immunocompromised children out there."",
  ""When you go to run your test for not only your clinical trials, the push to include immunocompromised patients, how big of an effort is that on your behalf?"",
  ""And the second part is, obviously across all the vaccine platforms you're working on, durability and having the differentiation of having T cells activated and having the T cells educated and learn to go after the virus as it replicates, how long do you plan on conducting those studies in length to try and show that your product is more durable?"",
  ""And the last question I have is referring earlier to the 10,000-patient study, and we were talking about we weren't sure when the first patient is going to be enrolled."",
  ""When you look at the timetable after the first patient was enrolled, what is the timetable that you have right now that you're planning to see to get those 10,000 patients all enrolled?"",
  "" very much, and  for the transparency."",
  ""I'm going to ask Mark Newman and also perhaps John Sharkey to weigh in on that."",
  ""I think clearly this quarter and probably sooner rather than later."",
  ""But before year-end, we anticipate to be announcing or reporting the interim results for CLL study as well as the final result."",
  ""Now, the final results for the healthy volunteer, just from the basis of knowing a little bit about where the statisticians are, that could move into early next year."",
  ""But as you're aware, that's a completed study, it's being – cleaned up the database, analysis is being done, and we're obviously urging the statistician to move faster rather than slower."",
  ""So, our goal is to be able to report both by year-end."",
  ""I think with certainty we feel regarding the interim results in the CLL study and relative to the healthy volunteer booster trial that may hold over into early next year, but we're hoping that it does."",
  ""So, let me ask John Sharkey, who also serves as our Executive lead on the GEO-MVA so to discuss that one, and then I'll ask for Dr. Kelly to then address the Project NextGen study starts."",
  ""I'll touch on those and then Kelly, if you want to add to it."",
  ""But the way we're looking at it is we want to see the results of the interim results with the CLL trial and remember, that's an investigator-initiated trial."",
  ""We've always felt that such a high need immunocompromised population that there is an opportunity, we believe, for an expedited development process."",
  ""When we look at the results, we'll decide that do we want to go forward with the company-sponsored trial and pursue that."",
  ""That would involve also discussions in advance with the agency about our plans, et cetera, what the outcome might be."",
  ""From the unhealthy volunteer trial is really we're seeking to see the final results from there."",
  ""And when one thinks about Project NextGen is exactly the expansion of that, it's a much larger trial."",
  ""It's generally healthy, but it's a very diverse population type of study participants and also it's a comparative trial."",
  ""Our stem cell transplant trial continues to add sites and enrollment."",
  ""And I guess, I'd say with that, like Kelly, would you like to pick up, add any other comments on this with our trials with CM04S1?"",
  ""John, do you want to pick up on that?"",
  ""Mark Reynolds, do you want touch on the financial first and then I'll address accordingly?"",
  ""And in regard – Jim, regarding the question about the partnering environment, et cetera, I'm going to ask John to weigh in on that because he and I have just returned from several weeks in Europe interacting with people about potential partners, et cetera."",
  ""Also...  I was just going to add, Jim, that the – what's surprising from some quarters to hear of the interest because of the need and the lack of access to Mpox vaccine, so to the existing MVA."",
  ""And so, we had people pointing out that in their particular region of the world, their locations, all they'd be very interested and have asked us to keep them updated as we progress with the GEO-MVA."",
  ""So, I'll ask Kelly if he'd like to weigh in on that."",
  ""So, Mark, would you like to pick that up?"",
  ""I'll pass that to you, ."",
  ""Mark, you want to address those?"",
  ""Kelly, do you want to address that?"",
  ""I want to thank everybody for participating in today's update and also especially members of our team who've been so helpful in answering these questions."",
  ""But we've had the opportunity to review our achievements, our progress, as well as our outlook."",
  ""We strongly believe that Q3 represented a continued and significant progress in the GeoVax development as a result of the Project NextGen award, our decision to proceed with an expanded Gedeptin Phase 2 clinical trial, and our progress with GEO-MVA as well as the advanced MVA manufacturing process."",
  ""Your interest is greatly appreciated, and we look forward to ongoing interactions."",
  ""As always, I'd like to acknowledge and thank the GeoVax board of directors and advisors, our entire GeoVax staff, and the many other parties that continue to support us towards achieving success."",
  ""We remain committed to providing meaningful career development opportunities for highly competitive, quality-oriented individuals seeking to disrupt the current paradigm of cancer therapies and infectious disease vaccines."",
  ""We're most proud and appreciative of our team, including those external partners who continue to contribute to the progress and success underway at GeoVax."",
  ""For all of us, it is a great pleasure serving our shareholders and being a part of this team."",
  ""Our overriding goal is to improve lives worldwide through our development and commercialization of novel, critically needed cancer therapies and infectious disease vaccines."",
  ""For today, have a safe enjoyable day, and  again for your support and interest."",
  ""So, there's a pretty standard process – valuation that we would go through, so in process development and – I mean, that's well-defined to the regulatory agencies."",
  ""The key element will be purifying the virus to, again, standards that are acceptable by the FDA."",
  ""We're just starting on the process development on that and generating – we have plans defined to generate cell banks."",
  ""So, giving you timing on it would be a bit difficult."",
  ""But I can estimate that once we start throwing people at it, this was qualifying the cell line and getting it to where we want and then starting to run test batches, which would not be GMP, but would be products where we test quality, the virus quality of our process, purity."",
  ""That's probably an 18-month process minimum, but it could potentially be – this is one of those areas where you can put more effort on it and more people and expedite it if there's a reason to do so."",
  ""We have not disclosed our regulatory strategy per se, but what I can share is we are in active engagement with the regulators."",
  ""The guidance we're getting is because it is MVA generally recognized to say that we're manufacturing on the chicken embryo fibroblasts platform for the initial registration, that there is indeed an expedited pathway for us that will involve abbreviated trial structure and probably at most some bridging tox in animal models."",
  ""We are continuing those discussions with the agency to finalize agreement on the clinical protocol design as well as what, if any, additional animal work they would want to see to support the registration."",
  ""But they've been clear that the – they do not see a need for us to do the traditional pull top Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3 for this asset given that it is MVA that ancestrally is very close to what is already approved, and we are for the initial product introduction will be using the chicken embryo fibroblasts platform."",
  ""Well, remember how MVA is approved for smallpox and Monkeypox."",
  ""It is approved with an immunological evaluation in humans as well as safety."",
  ""Efficacy is demonstrated in animal models."",
  ""We are having discussions with them."",
  ""What, if any, efficacy parameter would they want to see in an animal model to basically match the immunological response we're going to measure."",
  ""If they end up requiring an animal efficacy like, we could run that in parallel with the clinical trial."",
  ""So, would not be at all rate limiting for us."",
  ""The rate limiting will be running the immunological trial."",
  ""The – right now, we are projecting enrollment to begin around the 1st of October, the early part of October of 2025, that's being driven by the sort of manufacturing timelines and this is kind of where we are."",
  ""We – you've pretty much hit the high points."",
  ""Just to keep in mind, the healthy volunteer study, there's – we're comparing two doses of the vaccine."",
  ""There's no active control and there's no placebo control in that study."",
  ""And so, we're not anticipating any surprises to come out of that."",
  ""But as David indicated, we should have results of that by sort of sometime in the first quarter of 2025, I think."",
  ""For the cell transplant study, we're continuing to enroll our current trial."",
  ""We anticipate continuing that enrollment through the end of next year."",
  ""We've added a couple of additional sites, which should be coming online very shortly – I mean, literally within weeks, two additional sites to add to the three that are currently enrolling patients."",
  ""We've got patients in active screening."",
  ""So, we're adding to the number that we've already enrolled, which is around 30, 31 patients up to this point in time."",
  ""So, that – that study is continuing to acquire accumulate data, which will be very important to us going forward."",
  ""It's not a registrational trial."",
  ""We sort of recognized that from the outset."",
  ""But the data that's coming out of that study is going to be very, very supportive to any registrational trial that we do."",
  ""We have another sort of more robust trial designed – the study protocol drafted already."",
  ""And we're ready to launch that at the conclusion of this study – of the current study, which I think, again with the data from the current study added to it should give us a pretty – should position us pretty well to go talk to the agency about registrational pathway."",
  ""So, the benefit of – I mean, there's three vaccines out there."",
  ""There's ACAM2000 vaccinia, which is indicated as usable in healthy individuals."",
  ""There's LC16, which was registered in Japan and that was tested in children."",
  ""The vaccinia is a replicating virus."",
  ""The LC16 is a minimally – referred to as a minimally replicating virus."",
  ""Then, there's MVA, which doesn't replicate."",
  ""So, the nice part about MVA when you look at the WHO recommendation, it's recommended for healthy individuals immunocompromised, pregnant women, lactating women, children as preferred vaccine."",
  ""So, given all things being equal as far as availability, I think the general trend is if you have the option, you vaccinate with MVA because you don't have to worry about the patient's current health state."",
  ""So, we believe that the MVA will remain the preferred product in this space."",
  ""The other ones are there and depending on need, can be used, but our general sense of talking with people is that MVA is the preferred product."",
  ""It is currently right now, as you well know, a single source manufacture, very complicated manufacturing process."",
  ""If you want to make more MVA, you got to build new facilities to process those and transfer easily to other facilities, which is the whole basis of our AGE.1 platform while we're going to that because the benefits of the AGE.1, besides being more productive, is also a suspension cell line, which will now allow us to implement manufacturing in currently built manufacturing – vaccine manufacturing facility that typically handle suspension cell lines."",
  ""So, that's how you change the paradigm in supply for these MVAs."",
  ""So, the financials – the reimbursement on the cost reimbursement basis."",
  ""So, we're recording – the revenue we recorded is based on the standard personnel time each month with or it's layered on top and the rest will come as the bills – the respective bills come in from manufacturing activities."",
  ""The clinical trial piece that is not going to be reflected in our financial, that's through the release of the CRO who had a direct award from BARDA."",
  ""I'm not sure if that answered the question, Jim."",
  ""I think that for your model, I think that's a fair approach."",
  ""It's a little uncertain on our end."",
  ""But I think that's how our model for our internal cash flow projections."",
  ""The partnering area is still somewhat difficult in the sense that M&A and licensing has been a little bit depressed with everything going on."",
  ""People are actively engaging with us."",
  ""They're reaching out to us to talk at the meetings, seeing some significant interest in Gedeptin."",
  ""The CM04S1 is a little harder for some people to get their hands around because of all the political noise around it and it's not a big issue with the pandemic's passed."",
  ""But once we can engage them and explain that, yeah, it's passed for the healthy individual, but not for the immune-compromised individual."",
  ""These are still the people at risk."",
  ""They then begin to engage and understand that there's potentially a commercial opportunity present here for them."",
  ""So, I would say that people are engaging."",
  ""They are interested in Gedeptin clearly."",
  ""CM04S1 is – if we get the chance to tell them the story of where we see it fits, they will engage."",
  ""And, like anything else, it's again finding that match."",
  ""There's another thing that might be worth mentioning, and that is that – there was a recent publication out of the Fred Hutch highlighted the fact that the clinical trials for the COVID vaccines have traditionally avoided enrolling immunocompromised patients."",
  ""And given that the need is so great in that population, there is sort of an increasing momentum to recognize the fact that these patients need to be into clinical trials."",
  ""They need to be offered the opportunity to participate in vaccine trials, and we're hoping that that's going to – the attention that that's starting to get with the institutions that manage these patients is going to encourage some greater participation on the part of both investigators and patients."",
  ""We're certainly aware that it was launched and it's clearly offering benefit to these patients."",
  ""I think it's worth recognizing that monoclonal antibodies are not totally innocuous on the one hand."",
  ""There are a number of patients that have had bad reactions to those, not necessarily that one, but other monoclonal antibodies, and the fact that the half-life of these antibodies is pretty much restricted by the nature of what they are."",
  ""And so, one of the advantages that we think we're bringing to the – with our vaccine is a – by stimulating a strong T cell response."",
  ""We're enhancing sort of the memory response that these patients will develop to vaccination, and we'll offer them a more prolonged protection against developing severe disease or worse."",
  ""So, I think PEMGARDA is – certainly can be viewed as a competitive product in one sense, but it has advantages and disadvantages just like vaccines do."",
  ""I can't answer the exact strategy, Jason, other than to say that we've got multiple tools in our tool belt now."",
  ""We've got – we've recently installed an ATM facility."",
  ""We've got ongoing conversations with multiple bankers, and we've recently been able to extract ourselves out of the baby shelf restriction for selling shares under a shelf registration."",
  ""So, we've got a lot of opportunities here to efficiently raise capital with better terms that we've seen in the past, and I'll kind of leave it at that."",
  ""I'll try to answer the question as best I can."",
  ""Our relationship with Oxford Biomedica is we have multiple task orders with them for various different manufacturing campaigns for different products."",
  ""And it is a – I won't call it necessarily bill as you go, but there are – like the standard contract might be 40% upfront, 40% on a certain milestone, and then 20% Relative to the material for the BARDA contract, that's going to be fully paid for by BARDA."",
  ""I mean, we pay for it, but we – it's get reimbursed by BARDA."",
  ""So, it's really a wash for us."",
  ""Much of that cost is still in front of us, but it really doesn't affect us on a cash flow basis except for a minor bit of working capital needs just while we wait on getting reimbursed from BARDA, which is quick."",
  ""They pay us within 30 days of when we submit the expenses."",
  ""So, I don't know, does that sufficiently answer the question?"",
  ""If we – we would probably paid in January because we bill BARDA on a monthly basis at the end of the month."",
  ""So, our costs incurred in November, for example, we not – if we pay for that right away or even if we don't pay for it, if the expense comes in in November, we submit our invoice to BARDA first week of December, we get paid the first week of January."",
  ""The – we have a clinical oncologist on staff that's been sort of driving this – the design and prosecution of this program."",
  ""But – so, where we are is the single cycle refers to the single cycle of Gedeptin."",
  ""The study will actually involve a cycle of Gedeptin plus, which is Ad/PNP plus fludarabine along with a single cycle of pembrolizumab that will be followed by another cycle of pembrolizumab, then followed by surgery – surgical resection of the tumor and observation for effect."",
  ""So, it's – again, to answer your question directly, it's a single cycle of Gedeptin plus pembro."",
  ""But they're actually going to be two rounds of pembro given prior to surgical resection."",
  ""Now, the endpoints, we're looking for complete response, but we're also going to be monitoring for all sort of levels of pathological response."",
  ""The – our comparator is a recently completed trial looked at pembro alone as is new adjuvant treatment for these class of patients in which they were – there is simply no complete response to see."",
  ""So, we think we've got a pretty good shot at demonstrating something that's better than what the current standard offers in that regard."",
  ""Sorry, I had to get myself off on mute."",
  ""So, the – to answer your first question, our immunocompromised patient population is really our primary patient population target for CM04S1 and that's where we put a majority of our efforts besides the BARDA trial, obviously, in our development programs."",
  ""The durability question, in an ideal world, what we'd like to see is being able to reliably measure durability over at least a one-year period, and we're following all of our patients in our trials for one year after – following their first dose of vaccine."",
  ""What complicates that is the virus continues to sort of be very prevalent globally, and there's – there continue to be ongoing infections in these patients."",
  ""And so... ...when we're trying to differentiate a natural infection from a vaccine-induced immune response – immune response from a natural infection from that induced by vaccines, and patients that are getting infected throughout the course of follow-up, it becomes very difficult."",
  ""And so, we're very interested in the – we know we're seeing breakthrough infections."",
  ""We're not seeing any severe breakthrough infections to-date, and we're very interested in following the intensity of infections that will be occurring in these patients."",
  ""But trying to sort of sort that out immunologically is kind of a challenge for us, but we're working on it."",
  ""We're trying to come up with some workarounds."",
  ""The current thinking is it, we'll get all those – assuming we start this trial when we think we're going to start this trial, which is again beginning of October 2025, we should be able to enroll this – fully enroll this study within six months."",
  ""That's the – that's the discussion that we have with our CRO, Allucent, as well as with BARDA and that's kind of where we're thinking.""

76,3140003,00BL9Z-E,2024-12-02,"[
  ""We appreciate your interest in our company as we share the results of a pivotal and transformative year for CleanSpark."",
  ""The year marked the culmination of several years of strategic planning, preparation and execution to fully leverage the halving event."",
  ""We emerged with an optimal combination of power contracts, infrastructure, mining fleet, Bitcoin HODL and organic growth pipeline as we enter the next phase of the cycle."",
  ""Our financial performance this year reflects a sustained growth trajectory with more than $378.9 million in revenue generated."",
  ""That's a substantial increase from $164.8 million reported last fiscal year."",
  ""This year-over-year growth of over 125% demonstrates our precise execution of plan before and after the halving that occurred midway through our fiscal year."",
  ""Our adjusted EBITDA of 4245.8 million for the year also showed impressive growth."",
  ""That's an increase of $220.8 million or 882% growth over last year, underscoring the success of our infrastructure first expansion strategy and its focus on fleet efficiency and operational excellence."",
  ""As a result, we produced our strongest year of financial performance to date, solidifying a track record of effective execution and keeping promises to shareholders."",
  ""Reflecting on the past year, our growth aligns closely with the clear strategic priorities and objectives that we've articulated since our pivot to Bitcoin mining."",
  ""CleanSpark has prioritized infrastructure at its core foundation, putting us in the best position to source miners to optimize fleet efficiency and deploy new hashrate into production in the most capital efficient manner."",
  ""A clear example of this strategy was the Bitmain order that we placed in January 2024."",
  ""That order included 60,000 units and a strategic option to purchase another 100,000 units at the same low fixed price."",
  ""This cost certainty allowed the team to focus on building and acquiring the underlying infrastructure that supported our targeted growth."",
  ""Between our delivery schedule and growth in operational hash rate, the plan worked seamlessly and allowed us to reach 27.6 exahash per second at the end of September and 33.5 exahash where we stand today."",
  ""This keeps us on a path to achieve our next milestone of 37 exahash per second this month."",
  ""I want to discuss the way that we grew our infrastructure to support this incredible volume."",
  ""There are three distinct infrastructure growth engines: greenfield development, organic expansion, and opportunistic acquisitions."",
  ""Each pathway presents unique opportunities and challenges."",
  ""Yet, our team has repeatedly proven its ability to achieve or exceed our goals across this strategy."",
  ""I'd like to elaborate on these three drivers and emphasize their crucial role in advancing our strategic vision, positioning CleanSpark as the industry's leading operator."",
  ""Our goal is to establish the CleanSpark way as the benchmark of excellence across every dimension: growth, scale, efficiency, capital stewardship, community engagement and employee satisfaction, uptime and more."",
  ""We aim to set CleanSpark apart as a name synonymous with innovative and cutting edge performance across all measures that flow through to the bottom line."",
  ""Over the past 12 months, our rapid expansion has evolved our initial footprint into a robust portfolio of geographically diverse mining assets in Georgia, Wyoming, Tennessee, Mississippi and New York."",
  ""This regional structure maximizes operational efficiency, creating momentum in each local market and disperses our mining assets in such a way as to harden us against extreme weather, price volatility in energy markets and grid instability."",
  ""Moreover, we've taken the front door approach of directly engaging with the communities in which we work and live that we templated in Georgia, and tailored it to other rural communities that we call home."",
  ""Allow me to highlight some other milestones we've reached over the past year."",
  ""We've added over 425 megawatts to our operational power capacity, bringing our total portfolio to over 726 megawatts as of today."",
  ""This expansion aligns with a threefold increase in our total hashrate, which now stands at more than 33 exahash per second, and putting us well on our way to achieve the goal of 37 exahash per second this month."",
  ""This is a substantial leap from last year when we were celebrating surpassing just 9.6 exahash per second."",
  ""Our track record of execution and focus on delivering on our commitments has been instrumental in driving this performance and we expect to repeat it in 2025 as we look to exceed 1 gigawatt of contracted capacity across our portfolio."",
  ""With our infrastructure first approach to growth, we prioritize resource allocation across our three primary growth engines."",
  ""We optimize every aspect of our operations through cutting edge technology upgrades and ensure every new facility aligns with the exacting standards of our vertically integrated business model of wholly owned, self-operated sites."",
  ""Emblematic of this commitment, I'd like to remind everyone that our Coinmint contract is scheduled to expire shortly, making CleanSpark's operations 100% owned and operated by the end of next quarter."",
  ""Our growth trajectory has been remarkable, but what I'm most proud of is that we achieved this expansion with the highest levels of efficiency."",
  ""At the core of our approach is a philosophy that extends beyond achieving the lowest joules per terahash metric for our fleet or the best kilowatt hour price."",
  ""It represents a commitment to integrity, operational excellence and cost management that drives every decision."",
  ""Growth is not solely about increasing capacity, but consistently optimizing our hardware, processes and infrastructure to maximize output while conserving resources, ultimately delivering higher returns on investments."",
  ""Our current fleet efficiency now stands at 19 joules per terahash, and is significantly lower than our fleet average of 28.4 joules per terahash from September of last year."",
  ""This efficiency continues to improve as we transition into the next more methodical phase of our expansion."",
  ""For us, cost reduction goes beyond mere budgeting."",
  ""It is a discipline that enables us to reinvest in growth, while remaining competitive in an industry where success is designed to continually get even more difficult."",
  ""Operational excellence converges with these elements, ensuring that every facet of our operations, from power management to employee workflows, performs to the highest standard."",
  ""This commitment allows us to pursue an ambitious growth plan without compromising on efficiency or our core values, firmly establishing CleanSpark as a leader in our field."",
  ""We've achieved this level of growth through a balanced approach across our three growth avenues: greenfield development, organic expansion of existing sites, and strategic acquisitions."",
  ""While our acquisition strategy may receive more attention, we remain deeply committed to greenfield development, identifying and building new sites with the talent and expertise we've developed, particularly at our newest markets."",
  ""In Wyoming, we are currently contracted at 75 megawatts in 2025 and have the potential of adding several hundred more."",
  ""On the M&A front, we are realizing the rewards of our early countercyclical capital allocation."",
  ""As noted, we began preparations for the halving over 24 months ago, anticipating that less efficient operators would face stark choices about their future."",
  ""This foresight allowed us to position ourselves to capitalize on acquisition opportunities, consolidating over 170 megawatts in private asset acquisitions, including nine sites acquired in September alone."",
  ""Notably, after the end of the year in October, we closed the grid acquisition, which included 68 megawatts of developed infrastructure in Tennessee and over 400 megawatts of identified upside expansion opportunity."",
  ""As we move forward, we are more committed than ever through our focus on Bitcoin mining and setting industry benchmarks in this rapidly evolving sector."",
  ""Through deliberate prioritization, efficient infrastructure acquisition, and a reliable pipeline of state of the art equipment through our purchase agreements, we've established a process that has paved a path to reach our target of achieving 37 exahash per second by year-end."",
  ""With access to both power and hardware secured, and a rigorously vetted growth strategy, we've a strong track record of execution that aligns seamlessly with our vision for 2025 and beyond."",
  ""This strategy, grounded in countercyclical investment and the use of multiple avenues for efficient growth depending on current market conditions, has laid the foundation for our next milestone of 50 exahash per second in 2025, while insulating our growth plans from the cyclical nature of the industry."",
  ""Having overcome the challenges of finding the right approach and developing a winning formula, we stand ready to sustain our growth even as we've entered a bull market, which will have the potential to inflate industry asset prices, and may lead our competitors to make decisions that could ultimately prove to be capital destructive."",
  ""As a result, we may turn our focus away from additional consolidation and towards maximizing the organic growth potential within our existing portfolio, providing us with great confidence and visibility on our journey to 50 exahash per second and beyond."",
  ""Our decision-making process will be guided by delivering ROI to shareholders as we evaluate the options available."",
  ""Before I finish, I'll comment on the recent trends that dominate conversations about our sector."",
  ""While some competitors have diversified into AI and high-performance computing, we remain committed to bitcoin mining as a vertically integrated, pure play operation."",
  ""As we stay focused on mining bitcoin, we start generating revenue at greenfield sites in as little as six months."",
  ""By contract, a move into the AI or HPC space could extend that timeline significantly, potentially up to three to four years before investors would see comparable high-margin revenue."",
  ""The shorter payback period to revenue of bitcoin mining underlines the value and our commitment as we deliver returns to our shareholders, above all else."",
  ""We will evaluate new opportunities on a case-by-case basis, but we believe in remaining focused in our core strength, at least for now."",
  ""This conviction stems from the fact of bitcoin's finite supply, which we see as a long-term support for our disciplined approach."",
  ""In our view, each dollar invested in non-core areas represents a potential distraction at this phase in our growth."",
  ""As we rinse and repeat our playbook into the future, we strengthen our path towards a dominant position in the mining space."",
  ""In summary, we are extremely pleased with the results achieved this quarter and fiscal year."",
  ""As we look ahead, we are confident in our path to growth."",
  ""We are on a track to surpass 50 exahash in 2025 with plans to continue growing and expanding our operations."",
  ""Our vision goes beyond reaching this milestone."",
  ""It encompasses building a business that is scalable, resilient and repeatable."",
  ""Our growth strategy is rooted in operational efficiency, driving strong margins and consistent performance."",
  ""We've successfully delivered similar results before, and we are committed to achieving sustainable growth again."",
  ""In 2025, we will focus on increasing our installed hash rate and boosting our monthly bitcoin production, and always look for any opportunities to drive revenue and margin expansion."",
  ""As we look ahead, timing is everything, and we positioned ourselves to fully capitalize on the current bull market."",
  ""We're uniquely positioned with our power assets, and mining bitcoin represents the best way to monetize them, especially in favorable market conditions like we see today."",
  ""During this time, we'll continue to optimize cash flow and explore diverse sources of new capital to deliver value for our shareholders, but never at the expense of our core operations."",
  ""Finally, I'd like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the team at CleanSpark."",
  ""Their relentless efforts, creativity and commitment are the engines behind all we achieve."",
  ""Each success we celebrate is a direct result of their dedication, and it's a privilege to work alongside such inspiring professionals."",
  ""With that, I'd now like to turn the time over to Gary to review the quarter and fiscal full-year financial results in greater detail."",
  "", Krista, and welcome to CleanSpark's fiscal full year financial results call covering the period October 1, 2023 through September 30, 2024."",
  ""Our press release was issued about 30 minutes ago, and is available on our website at cleanspark.com."",
  ""Today's call is also being webcast, and a replay and transcript will be available on our website."",
  ""On the call with me are Zach Bradford, our Chief Executive Officer; and Gary Vecchiarelli, our Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Keep in mind that some of the statements we make today are forward looking, and based on our best view of the world and our business as we see them today."",
  ""The statements and information provided remain subject to the risk factors disclosed in our most recently filed Annual Report."",
  ""We will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures concerning our performance during today's call."",
  ""You can find the reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures in our press release, which is available on our website."",
  ""And with that, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Zach."",
  ""It's my pleasure to review the detailed results for the full 2024 fiscal year."",
  ""Hopefully, you've had a chance to see the , which has been posted to our website."",
  ""We anticipate our Form 10-K will be posted before market open tomorrow."",
  ""As Zach said, it's been a pivotal and transformative year, and our financial results reflect this."",
  ""The central fact that fiscal year 2024 is that Q4 was the first full quarter following the most recent halving event."",
  ""Warren Buffett has famously said, when the tide goes out, you find out who has been swimming naked."",
  ""While I differ with him when it comes to the prospect for bitcoin, Mr. Buffett's quip is a perfect metaphor for the impact of the halving event on the weakest operators in our space."",
  ""When the tide came in this time, CleanSpark had nothing to be embarrassed about, and in fact, we're downright proud of our performance, one that fully justifies the pivot to bitcoin mining we made several years ago."",
  ""Our revenues for the year were $378.9 million, an increase of approximately $210.6 million or 125%."",
  ""This increase was primarily driven by the increase in our bitcoin production, as well as a steady rise in its price."",
  ""For reference, we produced approximately 7,100 bitcoin for the fiscal year, compared to approximately 6,900 bitcoin for fiscal year 2023, which shows we have managed to outpace the significant increase in difficulty in the preprogram halving event in April."",
  ""Our gross profit for the year was $213.5 million, an increase and approximate $138.6 million or 185% over the prior year."",
  ""Again, the largest contributor here was the average bitcoin price, which was significantly higher than last fiscal year."",
  ""We also saw lower energy prices on a per kilowatt hour basis in fiscal 2024."",
  ""Looking at our GAAP net loss, we saw a loss of approximate $145.8 million for the fiscal year 2024."",
  ""I want to point out that a large part of our net loss is due to a noncash impairment expense of $197 million, most of which was recorded at our last quarterly report."",
  ""Finally, with respect to adjusted EBITDA, this non-GAAP financial metric increased to $245.8 million, compared to approximately $25 million in 2023."",
  ""The largest contributor to this increase was due to the increase in value of bitcoin as the company adopted new accounting standard, allowing it to mark-to-market its bitcoin balance at each balance sheet date."",
  ""I want to take a moment to discuss our power costs for the entire year."",
  ""All-in power costs at our wholly owned sites for fiscal 2024 were $0.046 per kilowatt hour, which is lower than our all-in power cost in fiscal 2023 of $0.048 per kilowatt hour."",
  ""Our wholesale electricity costs in 2024 averaged $0.031 per kilowatt hour, with prices as low as $0.012 at points during the year."",
  ""Included in our all-in power costs is an additional $0.015 per kilowatt hour of costs related to transmission and distribution, profit margins to the cities we operate in, and taxes."",
  ""Management considers its all-in power cost, which include these fees and costs on top of wholesale electricity numbers when analyzing its operations."",
  ""We believe that we have one of the lowest all-in power cost amongst miners in the industry."",
  ""And when combined with our uptime, CleanSpark is one of the top performers."",
  ""I also want to point out our cost to mine a bitcoin."",
  ""Our average cost for 2024 was approximately $21,400 for our wholly owned facilities."",
  ""Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, our cost to mine a bitcoin was approximately $36,250, which is an increase of 35% over the third quarter's cost to mine of approximately $26,950."",
  ""As a reminder, rewards were cut in half 20 days into the third quarter."",
  ""As Zach mentioned earlier, October marked the closing of our deal to acquire GRIID Infrastructure, a bitcoin miner with operations primarily in Tennessee."",
  ""GRIID boasts 53 megawatts of installed capacity, and we've already begun greenfield development of another 80 megawatts, fully building out a location in Eastern Tennessee, while also breaking ground in Jackson in the central part of the state."",
  ""GRIID's footprint in the rural Southeast is one that we're familiar with, and we're already porting best practices in community relations that we developed in Georgia to the cities and towns in Tennessee that we now call home."",
  ""Better still, GRIID developed a deep partnership with the Tennessee Valley Authority, one of the nation's premier providers of reliable and affordable power."",
  "" in large part to GRIID's efforts, TVA's senior management understands the benefits bitcoin miners bring to the TVA system, while also providing desperately needed revenue to local power providers, who have excess capacity, but little hope of attracting large industrial customers to their communities."",
  ""One of the challenges of the quarter came in September, when Hurricane Helene made landfall in the Southeastern US and disrupted operations at our facilities in Georgia."",
  ""We suffered a partial outage for two to three days that reduced revenues by approximately $1 million per day."",
  ""However, we suffered no property losses and made no insurance claims, a testament to the build quality of our facilities, and the effort of our team to harden the sites against damage ahead of one of the worst storms to strike the US in recent memory."",
  ""Controlling insurance costs means more than limiting claims."",
  ""It also means working with our insurance company to craft the best coverage at the best price."",
  ""We've also made significant progress containing costs for property and casualty insurance."",
  ""Insurance expense of the year was approximately $5 million, and is one of our larger G&A expenses."",
  ""While we expect insurance expense to grow due to large dollar value of our assets in operation, in November, we renewed our policy and cut our comparable rate by 25% going forward, owed in large part to the growing scale, quality and diverse geography of our operations."",
  ""One final note, I want to talk about our balance sheet and our liquidity position."",
  ""As I previously mentioned, we had increased our bitcoin holdings almost 260% in the year."",
  ""And that number as of today is rapidly approaching 10,000 bitcoin, which would represent almost $1 billion at current bitcoin prices."",
  ""We also had approximately $121 million in cash as of September 30, which represents a significant liquidity position going forward."",
  ""From my perspective, we have set the stage for a successful fiscal 2025 after navigating the halving in better shape than the rest of the industry."",
  ""Not only do we have significant liquidity, but we have one of the industry's most efficient fleets at an average of 19 joules a terahash."",
  ""We have a low cost to mine bitcoin, and industry-leading uptime."",
  ""Bitcoin mining is a capital-intensive business that requires prudent growth and sufficient scale to succeed over the long term."",
  ""Our company-wide commitment to this principle allows us to drive value through countercyclical investment, opportunistic growth, and increased operating leverage through continued scale."",
  ""In August, we used a portion of our bitcoin holdings to secure a $50 million line of credit with Coinbase, something that helped us take advantage of opportunities in the marketplace at a low cost of capital, which currently sits at an annual rate of 8.5%."",
  ""Looking forward to fiscal 2025, we'll look to find ways to monetize or leverage bitcoin on our balance sheet as we establish a digital asset management group within the company."",
  ""Working with staff who have joined CleanSpark as part of the acquisition of GRIID Infrastructure, we'll look to more actively manage the bitcoin on our balance sheet with an eye toward capital preservation, jiggering yield on a bitcoin, and protecting against price volatility."",
  ""Heading into this new year, we have significant scale and size, a healthy balance sheet, industry-leading operations, and a strong liquidity position."",
  ""We're well-positioned to pursue diverse capital-raising strategies."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call back over to Brittany to open the floor for questions."",
  "", Gary, for that detailed financial overview."",
  ""We will now open the floor to questions from the analyst community."",
  ""Operator, please provide instructions, and manage the queue for the Q&A session.""
]","[
  ""And congrats on a very strong fiscal year here."",
  ""Just a couple for me."",
  ""First, it would be great to get your perspective as to why you believe the miners have liked Bitcoin this year, especially considering that, at least historically speaking, CleanSpark and some of the other top-tier miners in the space have actually outperformed Bitcoin during this stage of the cycle."",
  ""Be great to get your views there."",
  ""Great to get your perspective, Zach."",
  ""And I'm curious if you could provide some more insight in terms of how you're thinking about the current market environment for ASICs?"",
  ""I know you're looking at 50 exahash by the end of next year."",
  ""But how should we expect CleanSpark to approach the ASIC market?"",
  ""How're you thinking about pricing and future repurchases here?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I want to talk about this digital asset management initiative that you highlighted."",
  ""I suppose, what are some of the paths you can take to generate yield on your HODL?"",
  ""And what level of yield do you think might be possible?"",
  ""And then, I guess just stepping back Yeah, excellent."",
  ""And then, I suppose just a final question."",
  ""Have your thoughts on HPC opportunities changed at all since your last call?"",
  ""And  for taking the question."",
  ""Zach, I wanted to follow up on your comments there in terms of the buy versus build decision, and how you're kind of prioritizing maybe the build decision to 2025."",
  ""I guess, where do you kind of see the opportunity in terms of the current footprint?"",
  ""I know you have Wyoming, which is some incremental couple of hundred megawatts."",
  ""I guess, just how do you kind of think about the footprint here more broadly, and what's the most readily available as you look out to next year, broadly speaking?"",
  ""And then, my follow-up here, just wanted to talk a little bit about fleet  for the color there, Zach."",
  ""I'll turn it back to the queue."",
  ""Congrats on the quarter, and  for taking my question."",
  ""Maybe just touching on CapEx for a minute, and you guys have kind of prefix prices on the minor side, but on the infrastructure side, the build out in Wyoming and like the other locations, I guess, what should we be expecting for next year?"",
  ""And in terms of liquidity, would you tap into Bitcoin position or would you rely just more on the equity markets for funding the both remaining buildout and mine purchases?"",
  ""And then, maybe just on the M&A landscape, I guess post having FOB, there'll be a lot more deals."",
  ""And we saw – and I know you guys have been aggressive."",
  ""Do you think the reason for maybe not seeing more deals in the space is that a lot of maybe the subscale miners were looking into an alternative use cases for their facilities like AI HPC and maybe they're evaluating that before they kind of consider selling or we see another wave of consolidation?"",
  ""I guess as you look at the public miners, I think, the top 10 largest have, kind of, owns, call it, 25% of network hash for the last like 18 months."",
  ""Do you think that changes over the next four years?"",
  ""I guess talk about yourself and just the industry as a whole."",
  ""Or do you think other nation state backed entities are going to increase hash maybe faster than public entities?"",
  ""Or how should we think about just kind of like your share of rewards going forward?"",
  "" for taking the question."",
  ""I wanted to follow up."",
  ""I know you talked about locking down or guaranteeing your price on devices."",
  ""I was curious what, if any, impact tariffs could have on that?"",
  ""I'm not sure the relevancy to the space."",
  ""And then I have a follow-up."",
  ""That makes a lot of sense."",
  ""Another question, we've talked about this kind of build versus buy."",
  ""And, obviously the discussion that far has been mostly around like building your own sites versus acquiring a site."",
  ""Curious, your thinking on just buying Bitcoin outright and what may – or what could happen that may change your view on that?"",
  ""I bring that up because obviously there are two big players in the space that have been pretty aggressively buying Bitcoin."",
  ""I was curious where you where you shook out on that."",
  "" for the insight and the color, as always."",
  ""Hey, Mike,  for joining the call."",
  ""I think the key with this is you have to zoom out a little bit."",
  ""If you zoom out a little bit over this, call it, a two-year period, the miners, CleanSpark included, have meaningfully continued to outperform Bitcoin."",
  ""I look at this as Bitcoin is catching its breath and catching up."",
  ""But I think it's positioned us incredibly well for what is ultimately going to be a slingshot and value as the market begins to better understand what the miners can do, and how the yields continue to be generated."",
  ""So, hopefully I see this as just a plateau point right before we see another upswing."",
  ""Yeah, the key for us is we've already locked in price certainty."",
  ""I mentioned during the call the S21 Pro purchase, which was 160,000 miners."",
  ""But we also have the XP purchase, which is a meaningful option for us."",
  ""So, in addition to the miners, we've committed to that essentially get us just about to 50, we have the ability to take down even more."",
  ""So, there's another 50,000 units with price certainty on them."",
  ""So, we don't have to worry as much about that swing in whatever the market does."",
  ""Again, certainty is what we created."",
  ""We actually have price certainty through 63 exahash on the ASIC market."",
  ""With that said, regardless of where the ASICs are at on the go-forward and in the future, beyond that, we've proven that we've a great track record of having a best-in-class purchasing."",
  ""So, wherever the market lands, we will make the right capital decision on timing of investment, when to add more to those options, when to take down the option, and how we deploy that."",
  ""So again, I think we've handled it really well as a track record based."",
  ""We have enough optionality ahead of us over the next, I'll call it, six months."",
  ""But definitely, our relationships are strong."",
  ""So, I expect regardless, we'll get best-in-class pricing."",
  ""So, from a trend point of view, I think that we have a lot of tailwinds right now, and that has – to take your second point on the political side, I think we're going to see a lot of opportunities in the capital market further open as we see a change really on the SEC side."",
  ""It's been a tough couple of years for anybody involved in this sector based on how the regime was previously run."",
  ""So, I think capital is going to open up even more than it already has in ways that will be very positive."",
  ""In addition to that, I think we're going to end up with regulatory certainty, but just generally a friendlier regulatory environment."",
  ""So, we're incredibly excited about how things go."",
  ""Now, from an industry trend point of view, I'm going to go back to something that I've kind of been beating the drum on, and that is scale matters."",
  ""And so, the bigger miners like ourselves are going to continue to get the best access and the best pricing the capital, which is going to create the best access and pricing for opportunities."",
  ""I do think that acquisitions But how we view them is going to really come down to valuation, where we've seen people that are very reasonable, they come in at the same valuations."",
  ""We've also seen private miners that want substantially higher valuation."",
  ""This comes down to my comment where I said we're going to avoid making the wrong decision."",
  ""But we do think miners that have fallen behind may be put in a position where they may choose capital-destructive activities as we view them."",
  ""So, there maybe some headlines on opportunities that we passed on, and we passed on because it doesn't create the ROI that we want to have."",
  ""Just because Bitcoin's up, we still have to measure timing to ROI for any investments we make, and that's incredibly important to us."",
  ""So again, a ton of opportunity in the future, but we're going to approach it with a very measured approach."",
  ""The great thing is we have several hundred megawatts of opportunities for organic growth."",
  ""And we've proven that we have a track record of being able to build sites."",
  ""And so, we're going to focus probably in 2025 more on building than on buying."",
  ""No, we still think that a very focused approach and what we have."",
  ""As Gary mentioned, we had a great cost of production of bitcoin."",
  ""And with Bitcoin going up, that even further enhances what was very healthy margins."",
  ""And so, when you look at margins that we can produce essentially tomorrow, right, on any opportunity we look at, the path to high-margin revenue is quickest for bitcoin mining as compared to HPC, and it's not even close."",
  ""So, until such a time as that changes, we're going to stay very focused on what we're doing and what we do best, which is bitcoin mining."",
  ""Yeah, I'm going to speak broadly about – we see the US still as a very ripe opportunity."",
  ""And it's because we understand power markets here."",
  ""But we think that based on the changes in the administration that the power markets will just continue to get better."",
  ""The US is full of abundant, low-cost power if you know where to find it."",
  ""And we focus heavily on rural areas that are being overlooked as an opportunity."",
  ""So, that's where we see the opportunity being the best in the US is in rural USA."",
  ""And as we go to these towns, we find that – I look at it this way."",
  ""If we're going to build something, the best opportunity is to build hardened immersion-cooled infrastructure."",
  ""And if we're to go buy something, there's a lot of air cooled infrastructure readily available."",
  ""So, that's really going to be how we look at this is first, rural America; second, the majority of our builds are going to immersion-based."",
  ""And if to the extent we do, do M&A, which I'm sure there'll still be some, it'll probably be air-cooled, but it's going to be in areas where the advantages to air-cooled are going to be that we can turn it on immediately."",
  ""It's that turnkey walk-in generate revenue."",
  ""And again, we've built our immersion and air-cooled systems in a way that we can now build for essentially the same cost."",
  ""And so, that's how we're viewing how we're going to build, and how we're going to buy, and where we're going to do it."",
  ""We're adding latest generation, so we're adding the latest generation rigs that are in the 13th already."",
  ""But what we're not doing is we're not retiring things without need."",
  ""So, yeah, we still have some XPs online because they are generating meaningful capital and it's not capital that we're going to throw out baby with the bathwater just to chase a number."",
  ""That's one of the key things that we want to drive home is that it takes balance when you're talking about capital allocation."",
  ""So, we're not going to chase the lowest number at the cost of spending capital for ways that's essentially unnecessary."",
  ""And so, we do expect to move from 19 to 18 to 17 joules per terahash and so forth all the way down."",
  ""It's going to be an incremental path that's going to be very measured about return to capital to our shareholders."",
  ""Now, where do I think that we're going to go from a Moore's law point of view?"",
  ""I think we're going to continue to approach that 10 or 9 joules per terahash level."",
  ""And then, I do think that's where technology changes are going to be required."",
  ""The chips are going to be able to do it."",
  ""But what about the heat extraction?"",
  ""This part of the reason we're going to build more immersion into the future."",
  ""I think that air cooled heat extraction will get more difficult over the next four years."",
  ""And so, it will be more valuable to invest in immersion."",
  ""Do I think that we'll get into the single digits and continue to go?"",
  ""Moore's law says, absolutely, we're going to do that."",
  ""But it's about having the infrastructure ready and available to accept the newest technologies as we progress, because this is not a measurement of where we're at today or where we're at tomorrow."",
  ""This is a measurement about how are we going to use capital efficiently to have the right mix of efficiency in power price, generate yield, not now, but also at the 2028 halving."",
  ""So we're going to look at this really over the entire cycle, but we do think that immersion is going to be a key role in kind of keeping up with that efficiency."",
  ""So, we think that the markets are going to be a lot more open to diverse options."",
  ""So, I'm not going to commit to any one type of capital at this point in time."",
  ""We think that there's plenty of room to expand our ability to leverage our Bitcoin further."",
  ""But there's also other – there's the equity markets, there's non-dilutive access to capital we can do."",
  ""That's the great thing about being a Bitcoin miner right now is capital markets open for business."",
  ""And so, how we do that is going to be whatever is going to generate the best return to our shareholders."",
  ""From an infrastructure side, kind of to your point, between here and 63 exahash per second is about roughly a $200 million investment."",
  ""And then, the miners on top of it, which we've secure at very advantageous prices."",
  ""So, there's not a huge barrier between here and getting to beyond 50 exahash per second."",
  ""I think it just depends on where you're at."",
  ""We've obviously took advantage of a lot of private opportunities that existed."",
  ""I think that there's still a lot of people that believe in Bitcoin on – and want to continue to mine privately."",
  ""And so, I think that that's where we're going to see some additional opportunities come as the private miners that wanted to see the other side of the halving."",
  ""You remember, Bitcoin has proven itself to be very cyclical."",
  ""And there is generally, in past cycles, it took 180 days plus for Bitcoin price to really adjust."",
  ""And we saw that happen this time around."",
  ""So, there's also the reality of where some private miners, they basically just held off."",
  ""They didn't run anything and they waited for 180 days to go buy to turn back on."",
  ""I think that we're going to see some of them, I'll call it, exhaust themselves as the whatever fleet they had that they just kind of held on and waited to turn back on to Bitcoin broke, for example, $75,000."",
  ""They're going to have a real decision to make whether they upgrade their fleets or whether they put the facility up for sale."",
  ""And I think we're going to see quite a few facilities come up for sale after they get one more bite of the apple from a ROI on machines that they may be bought four years ago."",
  ""And so, I think that there's a second wave of private acquisition to go on."",
  ""And I think on the public side, it's just – it's complicated to do any sort of public deal, and it rarely makes sense to pay the premiums that a public to public transaction would require."",
  ""And so, you really have to find the diamond in the rough that makes sense."",
  ""And that's why I think there wasn't more public to public consolidation also."",
  ""I think that we will see some nation state mining, of course, but I don't think it'll overtake kind of a public market side of mining."",
  ""And the reason is, is we just have different reasons to mine."",
  ""Nation states are going to want a mine just as a – just to kind of pad the balance sheet on one side or to just add to their own treasuries on another, whereas, as a public company, we're incentivized to really maximize and build on our percentage of market share or global hash rate."",
  ""And so, I think that's going to continue to drive miners to either increase or at least stay where we're at as a percentage of global hash."",
  ""So, I think that, if you think about it in different ways, we may be competing a little bit, but we're incentivized to keep up."",
  ""Now, the units we're buying are not coming directly out of China."",
  ""They're coming out of other Asian markets."",
  ""But what we've also seen, and I think it's been an anticipation of this happening, is we've seen most of the major manufacturers build out their production capabilities to include Mexico, which again, is still another place that may or may not have tariffs on the next upcoming future, but also domestic."",
  ""I think that as we see some of the foundries that are starting to get built under the CHIPS Act actually come into reality over the next couple of years, we're going to see a lot of them having domestic capability."",
  ""So, I think that there's at least some tariff risk on that that no one can protect against, because it just depends on when you bring it in and where you bring it in from."",
  ""But that's also the benefit of having a very large fleet state side."",
  ""One way to look at it is, if we're at 50 exahash per second and somebody else is at 20 exahash per second and they want to catch up, they now have to pay the tariffs on everything in the gap to catch up."",
  ""So, I think there's going to be a potential barrier to growth for some of the smaller scale miners."",
  ""And of course, the smaller you are, the more expensive your capital is."",
  ""So again, I think scale matters in a lot of different ways when you look at that."",
  ""But what we'll see what happens with the tariffs and we'll react accordingly."",
  ""So, how we look at this issue is it's the right time, right place."",
  ""It's a never say never."",
  ""It's part of our strategy to continue to manage our HODL balance."",
  ""There's going to be times we're going to buy and sell Bitcoin in certain transactions."",
  ""In addition to the kind of buying to add to the HODL, one of the things we pay close attention to is basically the average value of what makes up our cost basis for our HODL, which we believe to be amongst the lowest, because of course we're producing it at very healthy margins."",
  ""So, really the way we look at it is you're faced with the decision, do you buy assets to produce Bitcoin on a reoccurring basis at, you know what, right now is better than 50% margins to spot price or do you go buy Bitcoin?"",
  ""And again, it takes a more long-term view on that when you're buying assets to produce Bitcoin than just buying Bitcoin tomorrow."",
  ""But again, I think that for the right strategic reasons, we're absolutely not opposed to it."",
  ""We just feel that the best use and the highest return of capital to our shareholders has really been either buying or building facilities that produce Bitcoin."",
  ""Now, we are amongst one of the top 10 corporate holders of Bitcoin, and we do monitor that and plan to, of course, increase our standing on that list."",
  ""And some of the miners that are buying are also the same ones that are mining at a loss or a very small margin."",
  ""So, they have less advantages than we have."",
  ""Hey,  for the question, Brian."",
  ""Look, we're quite excited about pursuing this digital asset management strategy as well."",
  ""But I'll say that we're going to pursue a strategy of crawl, walk, run, and really that's going to be rooted in first focus in making sure that we preserve the capital, right."",
  ""Because when you have the Bitcoin HODL balance that we have, want to make sure that we really protect that."",
  ""When it comes to finding those opportunities to generate the yield, we're looking at various strategies right now."",
  ""We just closed the GRIID transaction here end of October."",
  ""So, the team is just getting up to speed and really looking at who those partners are."",
  ""But ultimately, it could take various forms of providing covered calls, lending the bitcoin."",
  ""There's even some talk about providing liquidity to ETFs in the marketplace, so."",
  ""But you'll expect to hear more information from us as fiscal year 2025 goes on."",
  ""And we'll really be focused on getting a healthy return on those assets as the year goes on."",
  "" for joining us today."",
  ""We appreciate your interest in CleanSpark and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.""

  ""Traders returning following Cyclone Gabrielle last year, supported by the diversity and resilience of our cargo base and also Napier Port's operational capacity and flexibility."",
  ""Comparing our trade volumes to the previous financial year, total trade increased 8.1% to just under 5 million tonnes."",
  ""This was driven by strong volumes of log exports, the bounce back in containerized exports of fresh produce apples, meat and timber, and a record cruise season."",
  ""Containerized volume increased by 3.4% to 230,000 TEU."",
  ""Good growing conditions supported the rebound in refrigerated cargo of fresh produce, apples and meat, and dry containerized cargoes picked up as Pan Pac's pulp and timber production continued its ramp up."",
  ""Bulk cargo volume increased by 9% to 3.47 million tonnes, underpinned by strong log exports, including from logs sourced from wind-thrown forests and unprocessed logs from Pan Pac."",
  ""In the second half of the year, two of our largest carrier customers, WPI and Pan Pac undertook temporary shutdowns of either or all part of their timber pulp processing facilities, as a result of high energy costs."",
  ""WPI announced in September the closure of its pulp and timber mills."",
  ""Since the WPI closure, we've been receiving additional logs from Ernslaw One, a member of WPI's parent group, and we've taken steps to reset our cost base by resizing our operations following the reduction of pulp and timber volumes."",
  ""With the level of increased log volumes and actions taken to reduce our cost basis, provides us confidence that the net impact on operating earnings is not significant and will not adversely impact on our ability to continue to grow our earnings."",
  ""We hosted 89 cruise vessel calls compared to 64 in the previous year, bringing a record number of passengers to the region."",
  ""Just moving to Slide 7."",
  ""Turning to our financial results, earnings growth has been strong and reflects the diversity across our cargos and revenue streams."",
  ""Revenue increased to a record NZD 141.4 million, a 15.9% increase on last year's record revenue."",
  ""This was primarily due to strong volumes of log exports, cruise revenue and average revenue per unit increases linked to our investments in infrastructure and customer services on port."",
  ""As cargo volumes returned, our strategies focused on yield management and cost management have developed strong operating leverage and earnings growth, with the result from operating activities increasing to NZD 52 million, which is a 39.5% increase on last year."",
  ""With the recovery of cargo volumes, activity on ports increased significantly."",
  ""This ramp-up came with some expected pressures as we maintained a freeze on recruitment and deferred spending following the cyclone in 2023."",
  ""By taking a dynamic approach to deploying assets and resources, we are able to adapt our operations and optimize space on port."",
  ""For example, cruise ships, bulk cargo vessel for logs and container ships were flexibly berthed across wharfs on a various basis."",
  ""Space, equipment and personnel were allocated according to demand, ship exchange sizes and as shipping schedules required us to."",
  ""This adaptable approach allowed us to accommodate our customers' shifting requirements, such as changes in volume or cargo type, as they continue their own recovery efforts."",
  ""The year has shown the effectiveness of our flexible 'whole of port' approach, which is delivering efficiency gains and flexibility for And expanded pavement works, these upgrades created additional storage space that was used to establish a woodchip operation supporting Pan Pac during its post-cyclone closure."",
  ""Currently, additional logs from WPI's parent company are now utilized in the storage space also."",
  ""And in the future, we have the flexibility to use this space for containers or other purposes."",
  ""These investments, coupled with our dynamic approach are generating operational efficiencies that underpin our strategies for yield management and a strong financial position."",
  ""Having built capability into our workforce, equipment and infrastructure, our focus is turning towards utilizing this capability to continue to transform our business."",
  ""The strong recoveries seen this year across key cargoes, gives us confidence in volume rebuilding within our existing cargo base."",
  ""The reinvestment by Pan Pac into their operations and their subsequent rise in production and continued visible investment in the port sector are indicators that demand and optimism in the region is building, and – particularly across the food and produce areas."",
  ""Napier Port's supply chain service, Viewpoint, works closely with our jointly owned Inland port in Manawatū and with KiwiRail."",
  ""Our partnership with KiwiRail is strong and collaboration has increased post cyclone, also post WPI's closure."",
  ""This partnership expands our reach out of region by creating more options for cargo owners in the Central and Lower North Islands that ship via Napier Port."",
  ""In the face of tough times and changing circumstances, we respond by reshaping how we delivered our services and looking closely at our cost base."",
  ""The priorities were rightsizing, adaptability and flexibility."",
  ""This journey continues as we look to respond to customer opportunities and how technology and other ways of working may enable us to grow and deliver further earnings growth."",
  ""Closely linked to this, we'll be continuing our focus on our cost to serve and working towards our medium-term goal of achieving returns in line with our cost of capital."",
  ""We've had good momentum and continue on embedding sustainability across Napier Port."",
  ""79% of the more than 100 initiatives identified in 2021 are underway."",
  ""This year, some of the highlights include running port tours for our local community, engaging our teams in our sponsorship of the seabird sanctuary, Cape Sanctuary, through planting days, a New Zealand first with a tracking of piers of Kororā or blue penguins to learn more about their behavior at sea and on land, and the implementation of an environmental management system, including external certification to support this."",
  ""I'll now hand over to Kristen."",
  ""Napier Port had a very solid year marked by strong regional recovery and key customer freight volumes returning."",
  ""We've reached several new financial milestones in FY 2024 and this is due to the resilience of our team, our diverse cargo base and revenue streams, as well as the capability and infrastructure and a whole of port approach to managing our operations."",
  ""While the closure of WPI was a setback, Napier Port's ability to adapt, and our core fundamental regional strength continue to provide volume and support our financial resilience."",
  "" to our strong financial position, we are well equipped to continue growing dividends and investing and expanding our cargo base, developing operations, and enhancing our capabilities for the future."",
  ""Looking ahead, we're optimistic about Napier Port's ongoing growth."",
  ""The fundamentals of core food and fiber Our strategic initiatives are driving growth, wharf capacity, operational flexibility, services on port and Viewpoint supply chain positions Napier Port well to receive and process more cargo from across the North Island."",
  ""In the short to medium term, earnings growth will be linked to growing volumes, together with efficiencies and yield management from the investments we have made in infrastructure and customer services on port."",
  ""We expect the baseline cargo recovery to continue throughout FY 2025, maintaining momentum in earnings growth."",
  ""Over the medium to long term, we're focused on achieving target returns in line with our cost of capital."",
  ""We will share further updates on our trading performance at the ASM in December and I will now hand over to Blair."",
  ""My name is Kristen Lie, CFO, and I'm joined on this call this morning by Todd Dawson, Chief Executive; and Blair O'Keeffe, the Chair of the Board of Directors."",
  ""During this morning's presentation, we report on the highlights of our full 2024 financial year, including some detailed analysis of our financial results."",
  ""We'll reference the suite of information released earlier today on the NZX reporting platform and also available in the Investor Center section of our website."",
  ""At the end of our presentation, we will be happy to respond to any related questions you may have."",
  ""I hand over to Blair to get things underway. ["",
  ""Foreign Language] (00:01:11) I'm Blair O'Keefe, Chair of the Napier Port Board."",
  "" for joining us today as we review what has been a milestone year for Napier Port."",
  ""Despite the challenges we faced following the impact of Cyclone Gabrielle, I'm pleased to report that our region and cargo volumes are getting back on track."",
  ""This year we achieved new financial milestones that underscore the positive momentum across our mixed revenue streams."",
  ""Our cargo base continues to be both diverse and resilient, supported by robust infrastructure and a highly capable team."",
  ""As we move through the year, a steady recovery in volumes was evident across log exports, fresh produce and the buoyant cruise season."",
  ""Coupled with operating leverage, the return of volume has delivered a strong financial result."",
  ""Looking forward, we are confident in the momentum of volume and earnings growth."",
  ""With infrastructure, capabilities and a proven track record of operational resilience in place, Napier Port is well-positioned to build on the success of this year and continue serving our customers and region effectively."",
  ""Todd will now take us through the year's results."",
  ""On Slide 12, this financial year, we again achieved significant total revenue growth increasing NZD 19.4 million year-on-year to NZD 141.4 million."",
  ""We saw this growth across all three service areas."",
  ""Container services increased NZD 8.2 million, bulk cargo increased NZD 7.4 million and cruise increased NZD 3.7 million."",
  ""Container services revenues increased 7.4% year-on-year on 3.4% higher TEU volume, and 7.8% higher average revenue per TEU, or ARPU."",
  ""Cargo laden for export and import container volumes increased by 5,000 TEU, made up of 9,000 more reefer containers, and 4,000 fewer dry containers."",
  ""At the commodity level, higher reefers were driven by a rebound in apples and pears and other chilled produce which were impacted by Cyclone Gabrielle in the prior year."",
  ""Lower dry containers were driven by lower wood pulp and timber, and canned and other food and beverages."",
  ""Empty container volumes increased 5,000 TEU, primarily due to the additional imported empty containers required for export cargo, while DLRs and transships decreased 2,000 TEU due to lower levels of container repositioning by shipping lines."",
  ""Average revenue per TEU increased from NZD 321 to NZD 346, another strong result driven by a number of factors including container mix changes, tariff increases, improved container depot revenues partially offset by the lower – by lower port pack and terminal storage contributions."",
  ""On Slide 14, focusing on containerized pulp and timber exports, in September, WPI announced the closure of all New Zealand manufacturing operations."",
  ""In our 2024 financial year, WPI containerized pulp and timber represented 18,000 of 124,000 full TEUs, approximately 7% of the result from operating activities, taking into account directly variable costs and revenues."",
  ""Whilst acknowledging the loss, WPI's pulp and timber cargo throughput at Napier Port, as Todd mentioned earlier, we're expecting an increased supply of export logs that otherwise would have been processed by WPI and we've made changes to our cost base to reflect the new situation."",
  ""Therefore, we expect to be a long way towards bridging the earnings impact of WPI's exit."",
  ""We also understand that a possible sale of WPI's pulp and timber mill plant and equipment remains on the table."",
  ""Pan Pac have effectively completed the reinstatement of their processing plant following extensive damage from Cyclone Gabrielle."",
  ""The timber mill is back to normal available capacity and their pulp mill is targeting normal operating capacity from December."",
  ""With Pan Pac volume ramping up and assuming no other changes, at an aggregated level we see containerized – total containerized pulp and timber Slide 15, bulk cargo revenue grew by 17.7% year-on-year, 9% higher bulk tonnes and 8% higher average revenue per tonne."",
  ""The volume increase was attributable to log exports, which, as shown on the chart on the right flow through the port much more consistently in 2024 compared to 2023 where the second quarter was impacted by the cyclone."",
  ""As noted previously, total log volumes of 2.87 million tonnes were supported by the additional unprocessed logs The average revenue per tonne increase of 8% to NZD 14.16 per tonne, increased as a result of custom mix changes, tariff increases and more log debarking, partially offset by a lower marine contribution."",
  ""Cruise vessel calls at Napier continued to be a significant contributor to revenue, this year increasing NZD 3.7 million to NZD 9.1 million on 2025 more vessel visits."",
  ""The current 2025 season is already underway and we have hosted seven vessels to date without disruptions."",
  ""We have 85 vessel calls booked for this season and as we've noted earlier in the year, this season features, on average, smaller vessels with fewer passengers."",
  ""The result from operating activities of NZD 52 million has increased NZD 14.7 million or 39.5% as revenue increased by NZD 19.4 million, whereas operating expenses increased by NZD 4.7 million."",
  ""The operating result excludes NZD 9.25 million of business interruption insurance income and related expenses, reported within Other Income in our financial statements."",
  ""As shown in the waterfall chart on the left, the increase is attributed to higher trade volume including cruise, and improved yields or ARPU."",
  ""Variable expenses including fuel, electricity, stevedoring and other contract services have increased by NZD 1.6 million on higher trade volumes."",
  ""Other expenses have increased by NZD 3 million and include higher insurance and higher employee benefit expenses."",
  ""The margin chart on the right shows an improved operating margin of 36.8%, which has resulted from our continued focus on costs and operating leverage on higher year-on-year trade volume."",
  ""Slide 18, our result from operating activities was the key driver and our underlying net profit increasing NZD 10 million or just under 95% to NZD 20.7 million."",
  ""Consistent with last year, we have adopted a conservative presentation to our underlying metrics by excluding BI insurance income due to matching and timing issues between underlying losses and eventual accounting recognition of insurance income, despite the fact that this income was compensating for lost operating earnings."",
  ""Reported net profit after tax increased by NZD 8.2 million or just – 30%, just under 30% to NZD 24.8 million in the year."",
  ""This includes the net business interruption insurance income of NZD 8.9 million, higher taxes on higher earnings, an additional NZD 2 million tax charge for the recent change removing tax depreciation on commercial buildings."",
  ""A brief comment on the insurance process, our business interruption indemnity period ended in August."",
  ""We are still working through claims and whilst we expect some further insurance process to come, we can't comment on the possible timing and amount."",
  ""Capital expenditure during the year was NZD 15.3 million or NZD 13.1 million in actual cash flow spent terms."",
  ""The spend was directed to mobile plant, wharf and site replacements and major maintenance and additional paved area within the container terminal."",
  ""A number of larger site projects were initiated this year."",
  ""The replacement of 3 Wharf fendering is complete, while maintenance dredging, breakwater eastern beach protection works were underway in the financial year, and are planned to complete in the coming months."",
  ""Capital spend is expected to increase next year to between NZD 22 million and NZD 27 million."",
  ""This includes NZD 13 million of committed spends, which incorporates the completion of site works already mentioned and the delivery of replacement mobile plant ordered earlier."",
  ""Seven battery-electric forklifts have been ordered for our port pack operation, five further eco-reachstackers for terminal operations."",
  ""These machines are expected to reduce running costs as well as contributing towards our emission reductions – reduction pathway."",
  ""Slide 20, underlying cash flow from operating activities of NZD 47 million, increased NZD 10.6 million or 29% from the prior year."",
  ""Reported cash flow from operating activities increased NZD 16.7 million to NZD 53.9 million, and included insurance claim cash receipts of NZD 9.3 million."",
  ""Total dividends paid during the financial year are NZD 13.1 million, including the final 2023 year dividend paid in December 2023, and the 2024 year interim dividend paid in June 2024."",
  ""Operating cash flow exceeded capital refinancing outflows, leading to a NZD 20.5-million reduction in gross debt during the year."",
  ""We ended the financial year on stronger capital position with gross debt totaling NZD 109.5 million."",
  ""In addition, we had NZD 70.5 million in undrawn credit facilities available at the end of the period."",
  ""Our debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times at the end of the period, or 2.12 times excluding the benefits of insurance claim income."",
  ""As at 30 September, NZD 85 million or 78% of our total gross borrowings were subject to fixed rates at a fixed underlying base interest rate, that is, excluding margins costs of 2.64%."",
  ""Our operating cash flow growth and sound financial position has supported the board's decision to increase the dividend for the upcoming December final dividend payments."",
  ""I'll also note in here regarding the Insurance Reserve Investment Fund that we flagged with our half-year investor presentation, we're expected to commence funding of this during the 2025 financial year."",
  ""As a reminder, the initial fund's target size of NZD 25 million is to be established over five or more years."",
  ""Lastly, a brief update on our sustainability emissions."",
  ""This year we've issued our fourth Climate Change Report and third with certified emissions."",
  ""Total gross emissions increased by 0.3% compared to 2023."",
  ""This was driven by higher Scope 1 emissions, and in particular higher fuel usage by generators used for higher reefer container volumes."",
  ""We also saw lower fuel usage by forklifts due to recent equipment replacements and fewer vessel calls."",
  ""Scope 2 emissions essentially, electricity consumption related, decreased substantially despite increased electricity usage as a result of official emission tax changes."",
  ""Emissions intensity on a per-cargo tonne basis decreased 7.2% as the overall I'll now handback over to Todd and Blair for concluding remarks."",
  ""And finally, we are pleased to announce today a final 2024 dividend of NZD 12 million or NZD 0.06 per share."",
  ""This dividend will be fully imputed and paid on 18 December to those recorded on the register as at 6 December."",
  ""This brings the total dividend in respect of the 2024 financial year to NZD 18 million or NZD 0.09 per share, which has increased from the NZD 0.0525 per share total for the 2023 year."",
  ""On behalf of the board, I want to thank our shareholders, customers and Napier Port team for their ongoing commitment and support."",
  ""We are proud of what we have all achieved this year, given the circumstances and I'll now hand back to Kristen who will conclude the presentation."",
  ""That concludes our prepared presentation."",
  ""We'd like to provide the opportunity for those on the call to ask questions related to our presentation and therefore I hand back over to the moderator to do so.""

  ""In the financial year, now a few questions from me."",
  ""Maybe the first around broader pricing and, ARPU, further strong gains through the past 12 months, albeit not all linked to tariff or price-specific rate increases, but can you give us a sense – and I recognize you've had your new tariffs on your website for the last, you know few months."",
  ""Can you give us a sense of what your expectations are with regards to broader rate increases across both bulk and containers for the next financial year?"",
  ""So, you know, with regard to this year, you know, you must have a pretty good idea of what you're going to be able to achieve though, in light of the discussions you've had with shipping lines, which should be off-tariff, but also what you've got on tariff."",
  ""Can you just give us a sense of what your expectations are?"",
  ""You know, I guess by the comment much more challenging is that that's probably less than the ARPU growth that you've seen this year of 8% and 8% respectively on containers and bulk."",
  ""But is it fair to say that we should also see, you know, ARPU be delivered in excess of CPI in light of what you can see on your tariff and levers, etcetera?"",
  ""Lots of other companies do."",
  ""Maybe shifting on to cost control, you've talked around taking a number of measures in recent times."",
  ""We can see the abnormal that has gone into reported NPAT of NZD 600,000."",
  ""Can you just talk us a little bit around exactly what you've done and what kind of annualized savings you're anticipating from those cost measures taken in recent times?"",
  ""So, maybe thinking about it in the context of fourth quarter costs were circa NZD 22 million from an OpEx point of view, well down on third quarter."",
  ""What are we looking for in terms of the run rate into FY 2025, or what kind of level of OpEx can we expect in FY 2025 if we spend NZD 89 million in FY 2024, but fourth quarter's, you know, clearly lower on a quarterly basis than the annual total?"",
  ""So, maybe, you know, I recognize there's a lot of detail that you could go into, but at an overall level, we should expect some increase."",
  ""Just trying to get a sense of the movements in the log export profile through the year."",
  ""There's clearly been some influences around wind throw, the Pan Pac logs, and then you know Hi guys... Yeah."",
  ""Just a couple of questions."",
  ""While we're on the logs, those WPI volumes, are they essentially locked in regard to, you know, going through Napier?"",
  ""Or is there a chance that they could go to either Port Tauranga or Wellington in the future?"",
  ""So, outside of the mill starting up, I guess I'm just trying to understand, is there a natural sort of geographic advantage you have with, you know, where they're coming from?"",
  ""Because it's sort of lower Central North Island we're talking about, isn't it?"",
  ""With the port tech facility, is there an opportunity there to use that space as being freed up for – you know, for other volumes, other customers?"",
  ""The elevated CapEx that you've – Okay."",
  ""You know it's been a reasonable environment as we've talked about in the last year or two, to get some good pricing increases through in the port sector."",
  ""It's kind of pleasing to see some of those initiatives also have been taken up by other bigger ports north of us as well."",
  ""That takes the pressure off us a little bit in terms of not taking the lead on some of the sort of pricing increases that's been done So, our expectation is whilst we'll still look at price increases as a lever to pull and the business to get the sort of returns we want, we would say that our focus will be more on the management of our costs and looking to grow volumes as well."",
  ""Yeah, I won't put – try and put a number on it, Andy, but, yeah, I think your conclusion about being less than probably what we've seen in the last years, that's a fair conclusion to make."",
  ""Again, I probably wouldn't want to make a comment on that."",
  ""Well, we've been looking at the measures post WPI in particular, where we've taken some steps to resize the operation and we would expect that to be – help to offset some of the impact from an operating earnings loss as a result of WPI."",
  ""Kirsten, you've got anything to add in terms of sizing on that?"",
  ""We don't always speak to these subject Yeah."",
  ""I mean, some of the logs that WPI would have been taking in, they come from forests sort of around the Central – Lower North Island, a small amount of it would go out to New Plymouth, a small amount would go out to Yeah, absolutely."",
  ""And that's what we're doing at the moment."",
  ""The ship that we had – we have on site for WPI and the storage and packing of their pulp and timber that was coming through, we are at the moment using that facility for other customers and actively working towards a longer-term customer for that site as well."",
  ""Sea gliders for... No, no."",
  ""No, no, no additional developments on that front that I'm aware of at this stage, no."",
  ""No further conversation has been had with them."",
  ""We had some early conversations a couple of years ago, but I've only been following, probably like a lot of people, what's been going on in the media, but no further conversations with them at this point in time."",
  ""Yeah, I guess, it's a pretty exciting sort of looking at a project, and my impression would be there's still a lot of work for them to do to see those actually flying around New Zealand's coast at some point in time."",
  ""We'll look forward to seeing you there."",
  ""Yeah, I don't think we'll comment I guess on the savings side of it."",
  ""Yes, we had done a reorganization exercise and unfortunately that has meant that some people have exited the business."",
  ""As part of that process we've looked at, I guess, the whole scope of our operations, so there are some that are obviously impacted, like around our port pack operation, but we've taken a look at the whole, I guess, cost to serve, if you like, around that."",
  ""And we've managed to, I guess, move people around to other vacancies."",
  ""And, you know, But as Todd said, that kind of goes our way."",
  ""So, I guess reflecting the kind of the post WPI world really."",
  ""So – and as we said in our comments, we expect to see it go a long way to bridging the loss and I guess, net earnings from WPI going forward."",
  ""Well, I mean there's obviously a lot of things going into costs."",
  ""So, taking, I guess, you know, a modest number of FTEs out, and I think, you know, we are, I guess trying to manage across all facets of our cost base."",
  ""There's some variability based on throughput, There's still – so I guess still pockets of inflation."",
  ""So we still see in the sector things like stevedoring charges, above inflation, sort of levels."",
  ""But, you know, a lot of other Oh, yes."",
  ""I mean, yeah, I think that's something that's fair."",
  ""I guess – I think we just talked about it before, could be a bit lumpy."",
  ""So, expecting elevated capital to next year."",
  ""I guess it's a bit early probably to talk about the year after, but there's, I guess, the program at the moment of some of the more major maintenance type across our site assets happening, and we've mentioned a few of them in the presentation."",
  ""So, there's a bit of that going on, which is kind of adding to – the thing is part of that's a bit of a I guess a minor backlog, if you want to call it over several years of, you know, watching our finances and things like that."",
  ""So, it's probably likely to flow through beyond next year as well, but I guess a bit early to give any color specific numbers."",
  ""Yeah I think we have up until the I guess the statute change date, but the charge that we have booked is largely deferred tax."",
  ""So it's the future impact of that change."",
  ""So it's a basically a non-cash impact on our reported results."",
  ""But, yes, you're right, we have, in terms of our actual tax return for that financial year, 2024 financial year, we will claim half a year."",
  ""But the major impact is the future deductions that we won't get because of that change."",
  "", everyone for joining us for the Napier Port Holdings 24, 2024 financial year results call and to your questions."",
  ""Have a good day and goodbye.""

  ""Our operating revenue for third quarter year-to-date 2024 stands at MYR 8.66 billion, which was flattish from the previous year, on the back of intensified competitions in the retail segment and a drop in international voice revenue."",
  ""That being said, enhancing profitability continues to be a top priority for Telekom Malaysia."",
  ""Our relentless focus on cost optimization and fostering a culture of continuous improvement across the organization has allowed us to find innovative ways to drive efficiency and improve margins."",
  ""I'm pleased to report that our group EBIT has improved by 7.9% year-to-date, increasing from MYR 1.68 billion in 2023 to MYR 1.81 billion this year."",
  ""This growth is largely attributed to lower operating costs, as well as the absence of the sizable impairment recognized in 2023, which was previously disclosed."",
  ""Moving to the bottom line, group PATAMI for third quarter year-to-date 2024 is at MYR 1.29 billion."",
  ""I would like to underscore that our core PATAMI remains robust."",

  ""Now let's delve into some of the normalizing item that have impacted EBIT for third quarter year-to-date 2024."",
  ""As illustrated on this slide, there were several non-recurring items that impacted the performance in the current period."",
  ""However, I'm pleased to share that when we exclude the effects of forex charges and manpower optimization costs, our underlying EBIT, third quarter year-to-date 2024, stands at MYR 1.95 billion, which is higher than our reported EBIT."",
  ""This underscores the strength of our core operational performance, highlighting our ability to consistently deliver value, despite external and internal adjustments."",
  ""It also reflects the success of our strategic focus on cost efficiency and the effectiveness of our growth initiatives."",
  ""Now, I would like to provide some color on our customer segments and product performance for the financial period, beginning with Unifi."",
  ""Competition in the retail segment remained intense over the last nine months, with competitors implementing very aggressive tactics."",
  ""Despite these challenges, I'm proud to report that Unifi continues to grow its cumulative fixed broadband subscriber base, which now stands at 3.167 million or 1.6% increase compared to the third quarter 2023."",
  ""Furthermore, Unifi ARPU is stabilizing, driven by increased adoptions of our lifestyle packages, a positive indicator of our customer satisfaction with our offering."",
  ""Our recently launched campaigns and promotions are showing strong traction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our UniVerse strategy in delivering value-driven, commission-focused solutions."",
  ""This momentum has contributed to Unifi's quarterly revenue growth of 0.7% in quarter three 2024, with total nine months revenue now standing at MYR 4.18 billion."",
  ""Looking ahead, Unifi will continue to differentiate as a true convergence solution, with a focus on delivering superior mobile quality, enhanced content offerings, lifestyle solutions, and high-speed connectivity for homes and SMEs alike."",
  ""We are confident that these efforts will strengthen Unifi's market position and reinforce our commitment to providing unparalleled value to our customers."",
  ""Moving on, TM One recorded a positive performance with revenue increasing by 2% from MYR 2.08 billion in first nine months of 2023 to MYR 2.12 billion in the current period."",
  ""TM One has embarked on various collaborations including enterprise and the public sector in the last few months."",
  ""We continue to be optimistic on this segment Moving forward, TM One will continue to engage closely with our stakeholders and As for TM Global, TM Global registered a marginal revenue decline of 1% for third quarter year-to-date 2024, with revenue standing at MYR 2.28 billion."",
  ""This performance reflects the challenging global market dynamics, including a gradual decline in international voice traffic."",
  ""This shift is anticipated as businesses and individuals increasingly adopt digital communication platforms such as cloud-based collaboration tools and OTT services for their connectivity needs."",
  ""However, we are already witnessing a positive momentum shift as a result of our adjusted market strategies."",
  ""Quarterly revenue grew by 4.7%, rising from MYR 752 million in quarter two 2024 to MYR 787 million in quarter three 2024."",
  ""This is a clear testament to our ability to adapt and innovate."",

  ""These initiatives position TM Global to capitalize on rising demand for data services and address emerging customer needs for reliable, high-capacity infrastructure."",
  ""Now let us take an alternate view of our revenue breakdown from product perspective on a year-to-date or nine months comparison basis on this slide."",
  ""We continue to defend and grow our core business as both data and internet recorded higher revenue levels compared to the previous year, with 3.2% and 0.4% growth respectively."",
  ""Others also recorded healthy growth at 8.6%, in line with our aspiration in pursuing new growth areas."",
  ""Voice was lower year-to-date, in line with the overall market trend."",
  ""As we discussed earlier, enhancing profitability remains a key focus for the group, and I'm pleased to share that our commitment to cost optimization continues to deliver tangible results."",
  ""For the first nine months of 2024, total operating cost has reduced significantly, showcasing our ability to operate more efficiently while managing expenses effectively."",
  ""This has further improved our cost efficiency ratio, which now stands at 80.5%, an improvement from 82.3% in the same period last year."",
  ""Let's take a closer look at some key cost movement."",
  ""Direct costs have seen a notable reductions, driven by lower international voice-related outpayment at TM Global, and Adjusting the forex impact, our operational costs are lower,  to our continued efforts in the following, optimizing maintenance costs across our network, IT, and building asset, reducing rental and lease payment through effective resource management."",
  ""That said, we also recognize the importance of investing in our people."",
  ""Our current manpower cost is a reflection of our effort in prioritizing the well-being of our people and boosting productivity performance."",
  ""However, I would like to note that manpower cost in 2023 was lower due to one-off reversal provision made during the year."",
  ""Overall, our result demonstrate a disciplined approach to cost management, while balancing strategic investment for sustainable growth."",
  ""Moving on to the next slide on group capital expenditure, for the first nine months of 2024, TM's capital expenditure totaled MYR 767 million, representing circa 9% of revenue, lower than 15.7% recorded in the same period last year."",
  ""This is very much in line with our project timelines, whereby several key mega projects were planned to kickstart in quarter four."",
  ""On the CapEx allocation breakdown, 55% allocated to excess investment, which include last mile connectivity, In quarter three alone, CapEx rose by 20% from quarter two, reaching 10.5% of revenue, driven by increased spending on access and core network."",
  ""This signals progress in infrastructure projects and readiness to meet upcoming operational needs."",
  ""As we progress into quarter four 2024, CapEx deployment will increase as scheduled, as we continue to uphold stringent discipline in managing our capital projects to ensure optimal return and outcome."",
  ""And now, let me take you to my final slide for today, our cash positions and financial ratios as shown in the slide."",
  ""I am delighted to report that our cash and bank balances at the end of September 2024 have grown significantly to MYR 2.61 billion, an improvement from MYR 1.94 billion in the same period last year."",
  ""This healthy cash position reflects disciplined financial management, particularly more efficient CapEx spending, despite higher dividend payouts and substantial borrowing repayments during the year."",
  ""Furthermore, our financial position remains robust, underscored by positive indicators."",
  ""ROIC has improved significantly, increasing from 10.31% in 2023 to 12.4% in the current year, highlighting our ability to generate higher returns from our investment."",
  ""We are also proud to see steady growth in value creation, reinforcing TM's position as a reliable and forward-looking business partner."",

  ""That concludes the financial and operational highlights from me."",

  ""I just have one question."",
  ""If I go to slide 10, on Unifi, is it possible to share the ARPU trends without device sales included in it, just so we get a sense of the service revenues?"",
  ""Because it's just, I mean, we don't get a sense of what the service revenues are doing, so that's why I was wondering if you could share that."",
  ""So,  so much for the call."",
  ""Firstly, very happy to note the positive trend in the Unifi net adds as well as the uplift in the ARPU on a Q-on-Q basis, despite the intense market competition."",
  ""Can you provide us with a bit more details on what exactly drove these two metrics up?"",
  ""I mean, in terms of subscribers, were you getting new-new customers or were you getting customers from other operators?"",
  ""And if it was new-new customers, is it due to further reach out in terms of distribution?"",
  ""And also, yeah, ARPU enhancement, if you can provide us some color there as to what happened?"",
  ""And do you think this is sustainable?"",
  ""I mean, what is the trend so far into October and November for Unifi?"",
  ""Secondly, on the customer projects at TM One, I think if we look at the revenue for the nine months, if you take out the MYTV settlement, it looks like the revenue is still quite flattish."",
  ""So, I wanted to understand whether you've seen any pickup in terms of the customer projects or is that visibility of the pipeline improving in the next 6 to 12 months?"",
  ""And then thirdly, Fairus, you mentioned just now the CapEx is a little bit low, but it's in line with the project timelines."",
  ""And you said that there were couple of key mega projects to kick off in the fourth quarter."",
  ""So appreciate if you can give us some color as to what these mega projects you are referring to?"",
  ""Yeah, those are my three questions."",
  ""And if I can just follow up with two questions."",
  ""Back to Amar, regarding the funnel for TM One, you said that you're quite optimistic."",
  ""Can you sort of guide us a little bit on when you see that inflection point where some of these projects will come in and we can expect to see better numbers for TM One?"",
  ""Is it like in the next one or two quarters or a little bit further out?"",
  ""And then, on the costs side, right, I see that waterfall chart, which is very much appreciated, it's been missing for the last two quarters, can I ask whether the manpower optimization cost of MYR 57 million, right, was that all incurred in the second quarter or was that MYR 57 million also part of it in the third quarter?"",
  ""And also, for the forex, can you like sort of break it up across the three quarters of the year?"",
  ""Then, how about the forex?"",
  ""And Amar, just in terms of, like, the renewals of projects and all that with the government, right, do you see any sort of pricing pressure in a major way over the next 6 to 12 months, are there any major projects that will experience that?"",
  "" so much, Amar and Fairus."",
  ""I had three questions on the results and just one on 5G. Just to clarify on, you have a forex gain of course below the EBIT line of MYR 159 million in the third quarter."",
  ""So the MYR 76 million underlying EBIT adjustment, that is purely on the above EBIT level?"",
  ""I just wanted to check that."",
  ""Second question is depreciation and amortization were lower Q-on-Q and year-on-year."",
  ""Should we be using that as the run rate going forward or is there any exceptional reasons for the reduction?"",
  ""And the last one on the results was, could you, like, give us more color on what the other revenue is under the product breakdown, what's driving that And sorry, last one on 5G, if you're given the option, would you be looking at investing in either of the dual networks going forward or you're going to completely be out of it?"",
  ""Yes, the other revenues under the product breakdown of revenues, that's up 8.6%."",
  ""If you could give us the nature of that, , Amar."",
  ""A few questions from me, please."",
  ""Could you just remind me again what caused the other operating expenses to jump as much as they did quarter-on-quarter?"",
  ""I missed that explanation earlier."",
  ""Number two, could you explain the tax rate?"",
  ""We seem to be running away on this."",
  ""Is this just because of the forex losses or what's driving this sudden spike in your tax rate this quarter?"",
  ""Let's start with those two first."",
  ""And I suppose the golden question comes back to your EBIT guidance and what you've delivered so far this year."",
  ""You seem to be well ahead of your guidance."",
  ""Are there any large cost items that we should be expecting in the fourth quarter to take us back to your EBIT guidance of MYR 2.1 billion to MYR 2.2 billion?"",
  ""Just want to be clear on that one."",
  ""Just one follow-up question for me."",
  ""If you could give us any progress update in terms of your joint venture data center in Johor."",
  ""And if you could remind us of the timelines of construction completion, when you can start All right."",
  ""Just wanted to confirm there are no available tax credits Okay."",
  ""We only show the ARPU trend blended together with the device revenue."",
  ""Let me take the first two question, and I will pass the third one to Fairus on the CapEx, yeah."",
  ""For Unifi, so  very much."",
  ""I believe it's success of For TM One, we granted that if you take up this revenue, it's steady holding, and we are quite optimistic in terms of their funnel, especially on the customer project and all the new signing between the enterprises and the government."",
  ""So, we are optimistic in terms of funnel coming in from TM One, yeah, on ICT and also connectivity."",
  ""So, I will pass it on to Fairus for the CapEx side?"",
  ""Let me come back to the funnel for TM One."",
  ""So, I don't want to give a forward indication, but what I'm trying to – what I can provide some guidance would be, there are projects Well, certainly in terms of the connectivity, we always remain competitive with the market."",
  ""However, in terms of our value offering, we are offering as a package together with solution for...   Let me – , Prem."",
  ""So we are on track to meet the timeline for our JV DC that we're doing with Nxera Singtel."",
  ""So the earliest  very much."",
  ""Well,  very much for spending time today for the question and answers."",
  ""Well, I think as Unifi, as we've seen the – recorded a very good trajectory for the year – for the quarter."",
  ""So, I do hope to promote more for those existing Unifi customers, there are three six-month trial period for our Unifi mobile service."",
  ""So, do have a go and port to our network."",
  "" very much for your support."",
  "", Encik Aman, and Encik Fairus."",
  ""We will now begin the Q&A session."",
  ""If you would like to ask question ."",
  ""Hi, as far as Sorry, I think on the – Foong, I think we are actually referring to underlying EBIT, right?"",
  ""And on the questions you are specifically asking, when actually we incurred, and this is largely coming during quarter two this year."",
  ""On the forex, I think this is actually for the third quarter, we see actually a forex loss on our operations."",
  ""This is largely because of strengthening of Malaysia ringgit against the USD."",
  ""Up next Luis, go ahead."",
  ""Luis, can you just repeat your third question again, Let me actually address the first two questions."",
  ""On the forex, is that forex loss is actually incurred for the quarter three, right."",
  ""So, we are excluding this to determine our underlying EBIT, right."",
  ""On the depreciation and amortization, you are asking about run rate."",
  ""As far as existing asset base, that should be the run rate."",
  ""But we are going to ramp up our capital expenditure, capital spending, and we expect that to actually go up again after the product delivery."",
  ""All right, Luis, on the third question, on the other revenues and the products, that basically covers our , Luis."",
  ""On the, what caused the operating cost to increase quarter-on-quarter?"",
  ""As I mentioned earlier, this is largely driven by our forex losses on operations, right?"",
  ""So, we have EBIT on normalized item for forex losses was MYR 76 million, so that's one."",
  ""And on the tax rate, I don't see any abnormality."",
  ""Our standard tax rate is about I think if I can just recap to everyone our EBIT guidance is actually between MYR 2.1 billion-MYR 2.2 billion and we expect to meet the guidance at most, you know, what it can be."",
  ""Luis, you're back for round two."",
  ""We don't have anyone on the line for questions."",
  ""Do you have any other questions from anyone else?"",
  ""Prem, did you just put up your hand?"",
  ""So anyone want to ask anything?"",
  ""Sorry, can you just repeat that again?"",
  ""On the tax credit, I think is the normal or usual tax credit that would be actually incurring based on our capital expenditure."",
  ""Other than that, we'll make further announcement if we have any."",
  ""Since we have no more further questions, maybe, Encik Amar, you want to say any parting words or promotions?"",
  ""The next time you see me and my team, please be using Unifi.""

  ""As usual I will make a few comments before handing it over to Allan to go through the course in more detail."",
  ""In the third quarter, we once again demonstrated the strength of our business, our access to Gross premiums written increased by 25%, driven by the focused and disciplined execution by our team and the compelling value we offer to the market."",
  ""Year-to-date, gross premiums written have increased 23% and for the full year, we remain on course to achieve premium growth of approximately 20% in line with last year."",
  ""We continue to benefit from a strong rating environment across our portfolio with an overall RPI of 112% for the quarter as we leverage our position as a leader in a And as a reminder, Looking at our segments in more detail, in specialty, gross premiums written increased by 22% for the quarter, with In Marine, we continue to leverage our participation In Bespoke, we expanded our client base and delivered strong gross premium growth, closing a number of transactions in structured Credit & Political Risk."",
  ""And finally, reinsurance also saw strong growth in gross premiums written, again driven by both expanding existing client relationships and attracting new business."",
  ""Reinsurance market discipline around rates remained following significant positive adjustments in prior years with RPIs of 105%."",
  ""In addition to strong top line performance, We delivered compelling bottom line profitability with a combined ratio of 87.4% in the quarter and year-to-date our combined ratio is 88.6%."",
  ""Both are within our target of mid to high 80s across the cycle."",
  ""We also delivered annualized operating ROAE of 16.4% bringing year to date annualized operating ROAE to 13.3%."",
  ""Finally, active capital management remains a cornerstone of our strategy."",
  ""While our first priority is to reinvest into the underwriting business, our strong capital position has also allowed us to return excess capital to shareholders."",
  ""Since we initiated it on dividends and share buyback programs at the beginning of this year, we have returned $141 million to shareholders."",
  ""During the third quarter, we continued to buy back shares, including the execution of a privately negotiated transaction with Platinum Ivy, a wholly owned subsidiary of ADIA who remains one of our longstanding shareholders."",
  ""Allan will go into this and our broader consultation strategy in more detail shortly."",
  ""In summary, I'm very pleased with our third quarter results and the ongoing dedication displayed by our team."",
  ""I'll now pass it over to Allan to walk through our financial results in more detail."",
  ""And I'd also like to welcome everyone joining our third quarter ."",
  ""We had excellent top line growth compared to the same quarter last year, growing by 25% to $742 million."",
  ""Against a backdrop of active global natural catastrophes, we generated operating net income of $105 million or $0.92 per diluted common share and an annualized operating return on average equity of 16.4%."",
  ""We're continuing to grow our book value per diluted common share, which now stands at $23.43, an increase of 13% from year end and an increase of 8% from last quarter."",
  ""Building on Dan's comments, our growth of gross premiums written for the quarter was primarily driven by new business and rate increases, with specialty increasing by 22% or $72 million; Bespoke increasing by 15% to $24 million, and reinsurance increasing by 52% or $54 million."",
  ""Consistent with our growth of gross premiums written, our net premiums earned increased by 24% versus the third quarter of 2023 to $635 million."",
  ""Turning to the combined ratio, we delivered a strong ratio of 87.4% in the quarter."",
  ""Looking at the components in more detail, our loss ratio was 37.5% for the third quarter, in line with the prior year period, even as gross premiums increased, underscoring our emphasis on delivering profitable growth."",
  ""Our attritional loss ratio improved to 24.7% compared to 30.4% in the prior year period."",
  ""This improvement is attributable to a lower level of losses across all three segments, consistent with the trends we discussed in the second quarter."",
  ""Notably, the third quarter was particularly benign in terms of attritional losses compared to the prior year."",
  ""Catastrophe loss activity in the third quarter was impacted by several events generating catastrophe and large loss ratio of 14.4% or $92 million of losses in the quarter."",
  ""Of this, specialty accounted for $63 million, Bespoke $13 million and reinsurance $15 million."",
  ""The most notable events were Hurricane Helene, with losses of $34 million and European Storm Boris with losses of $24 million, which impacted both our specialty and reinsurance segments."",
  ""We had net favorable prior year development, $10 million for the quarter versus $43 million in the prior year period."",
  ""Of the $10 million for the quarter Bespoke was $11 million and reinsurance was $13 million, driven by benign attritional experience."",
  ""Specialty experienced adverse prior year development of $14 million during the quarter, driven by increased estimates in our aviation and aerospace line of business in the context of ongoing Russia-Ukraine litigation in multiple jurisdictions, including the US, the UK and Ireland."",
  ""This was partially offset by better than expected Turning to expenses."",
  ""Policy acquisition expenses from third parties were 31 points of the combined ratio for the quarter, compared to 29.6 points in the prior year period."",
  ""The increase is primarily driven by an increase in our Specialty segment, which had higher variable commissions in the quarter."",
  ""The Fidelis Partnership commissions were 15.3 points of the combined ratio for the quarter, of which 2.1 points related to their variable accrued profit commissions."",
  ""These commissions increased from 13.9 points in the prior year period, reflecting the full impact of earning these commissions since the agreement went into effect."",
  ""And finally, our general and administrative expenses were 3.6 points of the combined ratio for the quarter or $23 million compared to 4.3 points of the combined ratio in the prior year period or $22 million."",
  ""Our net investment income increased to $52 million in the third quarter of 2024, compared with $33 million in the prior year period, reflecting a higher yield fixed income portfolio and an increase in investable assets compared to the prior year period."",
  ""We continued the selective rotation of the portfolio started in the first quarter of 2024 by selling a portion of the fixed income portfolio and reinvesting the proceeds into longer-dated and higher yielding securities."",
  ""Specifically, we sold $203 million of securities with an average book yield of 1%, resulting in a realized loss of $6 million."",
  ""We reinvested $38 million from those proceeds, along with positive cash flows into securities with an average purchase yield of approximately 4.6%."",
  ""At September 30, the average rating of fixed income securities remains very high at AA- with a book yield of 4.9%."",
  ""Duration is consistent with the second quarter at 2.7 years, which is an increase since year-end as a result of purchasing longer-dated securities."",
  ""We continue to work towards optimizing our overall investment portfolio and look for opportunities to generate superior risk-adjusted investment returns."",
  ""Building on Dan's comments regarding our ongoing focus on capital management, we continue to pursue value-accretive opportunities."",
  ""Our first priority remains reinvesting in the business by deploying capital into attractive growth initiatives."",
  ""Additionally, we continually seek to optimize our outward reinsurance purchasing."",
  ""And when we have excess capital, we look to return it to shareholders through a combination of dividends and opportunistic share buybacks."",
  ""On our last , it was mentioned that we had completed the previously announced $50 million share repurchase program."",
  ""Additionally, we announced that our board had approved a new program authorizing the purchase up to an aggregate of $200 million of common shares."",
  ""Year-to-date, we have repurchased 3.6 million common shares at an average price of $16.06."",
  ""This is approximately 69% of our current diluted book value per share and that's highly accretive on both the book value and earnings per share basis to our shareholders."",
  ""The total includes 3.25 million common shares that we repurchased from Platinum Ivy, a wholly owned subsidiary of ADIA, who remains one of our longstanding shareholders through a privately negotiated transaction completed during the quarter."",
  ""I will now turn it back to Dan for additional remarks, including thoughts on market outlook."",
  ""Looking ahead, we continue to see areas of opportunity across the market."",
  ""Significant year-on-year pricing adjustments across multiple lines of business have led to one of the best sustained rating environments we have seen in years."",
  ""Although the acceleration of rates might not continue at the same pace, we remain focused on maintaining our discipline and utilizing our scale and positioning to seek out new opportunities."",
  ""And as we've mentioned, in a verticalized market, being a leader, is a competitive advantage, as it provides a first look at business opportunities and enables us to achieve better rates, terms and conditions."",
  ""Delving deeper into the dynamics within each of our underwriting segments, in Specialty looking at the fourth quarter, attractive opportunities for growth remain particularly in Property Direct, with rates remain attractive, client retention that was a high and we continue to see increased demand."",
  ""Certain sectors, such as Marine and Aviation, are experiencing some pressure as rates begin to moderate."",
  ""However, we believe our line size, multi-product leverage, flexible underwriting strategy and ability to cross sell products provides us access to the best price and most compelling risks in each class."",
  ""This enables us to find attractive opportunities, while maintaining our underwriting integrity."",
  ""In Bespoke, as we discussed, given the custom and direct nature of this product line, we lead substantially all our deals."",
  ""While the highly tailored profile of these policies results in variable deal flow, as we look to the fourth quarter and into 2025, our pipeline remains strong and is currently tracking into the previous year."",
  ""In structured credit and political risk in particular, we continue to see attractive opportunities from a risk-return perspective."",
  ""We are actively pursuing these new opportunities, while also pushing for higher allocations as we leverage our track record of supports and strong relationships in the industry."",
  ""Finally, in reinsurance, market dynamics remain favorable and we expect discipline to persist, especially in relation to prior year market corrections around attachment points, terms and conditions."",
  ""Certain regional loss-impacted accounts should see price adjustments and we believe that recent weather catastrophes, including Helene and Milton, will reinforce market discipline."",
  ""Based on events to-date our current view is that rates for At this point, we have a preliminary range of between $50 million to $100 million of pre-tax losses net of reinsurance."",
  ""This is based on an industry range of $20 billion to $50 billion."",
  ""Outwards reinsurance remains a key part of our strategy."",
  ""We spend significant time building long-term relationships with our reinsurance partners."",
  ""This ensures that our engagement across the breadth of our portfolio, which we see as a strength of outwards strategy."",
  ""Looking ahead to 2025, our aim remains to maintain our core quota share relationships and we are currently in the process of shaping our outwards reinsurance program."",
  ""This includes negotiations around catastrophe bond products and discussions on the Travelers quota share for 2025."",
  ""Our objective remains to build an outward program that provides robust portfolio protection."",
  ""Overall, across our portfolio, we continue to pursue accretive opportunities for growth."",
  ""As we work through our annual planning process with the Fidelis Partnership, we are finding a number of opportunities to leverage new distribution channels and markets, as well as opportunities to cross-sell products."",
  ""For instance, we believe that our participation in Lloyd's Syndicate 3123 and the Brooks initiative both will provide opportunities for growth with new clients and into new markets."",
  ""To broaden and enhance our portfolio, we also continue to evaluate new opportunities to provide long-term capacity to best-in-class underwriters."",
  ""To that end, we are excited to announce a new strategic partnership with Euclid Mortgage."",
  ""Through this collaboration Fidelis Insurance Group alongside other reinsurers, will provide capacity for Euclid Mortgage on a reinsurance basis."",
  ""This partnership, commencing on January 1, 2025, is estimated to produce approximately $35 million of gross premiums written in 2025."",
  ""While the Fidelis Partnership remains our cornerstone partner, this opportunity to support a new partner with proven expertise in an attractive line of business is a natural evolution as we continue our journey to diversify and strengthen our portfolio."",
  ""Given the strong credentials of the Euclid Mortgage team, we anticipate this partnership will contribute to our overarching goal of sustained growth and profitability."",
  ""In conclusion, we are pleased with the momentum in our business."",
  ""We continue to successfully execute on our strategy, optimizing our risk-adjusted returns and leveraging our scale and lead positioning to generate underwriting alpha."",
  ""This is reflected in our strong third quarter results."",
  ""As we look ahead, we remain focused on continuing to deliver very strong performance and creating value for our shareholders."",
  ""I now hand it back to the operator, we look forward to your questions."",
  ""With me today are Dan Burrows, our CEO; and Allan Decleir, our CFO; and Jonny Strickle, our Chief Actuarial Officer."",
  ""Before we begin, I'd like to remind everyone that statements made during the call, including the question-and-answer session, may include forward-looking statements."",
  ""These statements are based upon management's current assumptions and assumptions and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and emerging information developing over time."",
  ""These risks and uncertainties are described in our third quarter earnings press release and our most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC."",
  ""Both are available on our website at fidelisinsurance.com."",
  ""Although we believe that the expectations reflected in forward-looking statements have a reasonable basis when made, we can give no assurance that these expectations will be achieved."",
  ""Consequently, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied."",
  ""For more information, including on the risks and other factors that may affect future performance, investors should review the Safe Harbor regarding forward-looking statements included in our third quarter earnings press release available on our website fidelisinsurance.com, as well as those periodic reports that are filed by us with the SEC from time to time."",
  ""Management will also make reference to certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance."",
  ""The reconciliations to US GAAP for each non-GAAP financial measure and our definition of RPI, which is our renewal pricing index, can be found in our current report on Form 6-K, furnished with the SEC yesterday, which contains our earnings press release and is available on our website at fidelisinsurance.com."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Dan.""
]","[
  ""Dan, I was hoping you could dig in a little bit on the adverse in the Aviation business that you talked about in the opening comments."",
  ""Yes, I guess two parts to the question."",
  ""One is just what was the dollar amount of the adverse in the Aviation, I know the net, but kind of what the piece was there?"",
  ""And then secondly, I think in the past, you've described kind of a – maybe I'm describing it wrong, but a kind of a probabilistic model that you've built to kind of get you to how you set reserves for what is a pretty unique event and just what changed – kind of what changed around the edges with kind of that process to get to a new number?"",
  ""Can you give the dollar – the net of the pluses and minuses was $14 million adverse."",
  ""Can you give the recent Aviation what the – how much you added to reserves before the offsets from the D&F and elsewhere?"",
  ""And then a follow-up, if I could."",
  ""Probably good question for you, Dan."",
  ""Earlier in the reporting season some – at least one big peer kind of pointed the finger at the London market in terms of being very competitive."",
  ""I didn't get that sense from kind of your view of the world."",
  ""You mentioned Aviation, but beyond that, I would be curious if you could just give your perspective."",
  ""You guys obviously know London incredibly well, kind of what the market looks like and the competition level?"",
  ""And Dan, it's great to have you back on the call."",
  ""Over the course of 2024, you've talked about, I guess preferring the returns in Property D&F compared to catastrophe reinsurance."",
  ""I'm wondering whether that still holds, given what we're seeing and pricing for those two different lines."",
  ""And then sort of switching gears, should we think of the loss ratio expectations for the Euclid relationship as similar to primary mortgage insurers or to the mortgage reinsurers at this point?"",
  ""I need a little bit of help, I'm not an expert in this business, but you guys seem very analytical, which is good, I'm just curios how you stack up the relative attraction of stock repurchase versus writing more business?"",
  ""And as you track things now, what kind of top line growth would you anticipate in 2025 versus 2024?"",
  ""Do you expect higher revenues, lower revenues, will there magnitude of change."",
  ""So what would you deem your amount of excess capital is currently?"",
  ""I didn't hear that response."",
  ""But I guess it was in the area of a couple of hundred million that's what you announced in terms of your buyback intentions."",
  ""What I'm struggling with is, I think when I look at most companies, a company could earn 14% to 16% in equity, will be selling at a premium to book value and at a big discount to book value."",
  ""Do you guys look at it the same way or are you looking at – am I looking at it incorrectly?"",
  ""My question, I guess, first is just to Allan on the acquisition ratio."",
  ""It looks like that was a bit higher."",
  ""Looks like it was driven by the specialty segment."",
  ""I think you had mentioned some variable commissions."",
  ""I was wondering if you could elaborate on that a little bit and just wanted to know has your view on the acquisition ratio changed going forward?"",
  ""And so I guess for the total company, I guess, we shouldn't be thinking about a 31% acquisition ratio going forward."",
  ""But, I guess should we be looking at the first half of the year sort of like a decent run rate?"",
  ""And then, Dan, I think you had mentioned just stable combined ratio expectations for next year."",
  ""Should I also take that to mean the 14% to 16% ROE is also how you guys are thinking about 2025 as well?"",
  ""Hey,  for taking my question."",
  ""Dan, it looks like pricing was able to stay roughly flattish quarter-over-quarter, while many of your peers were talking about significant property pricing decreasing at least in the US E&S market."",
  ""So, it seems like Fidelis is benefiting from the leadership position in many of these lines."",
  ""But I'm curious if there's other nuances to be thinking about relative to the quarter and how you're able to achieve that or if it's that simple?"",
  ""And then on the net investment income, I just had a follow-up."",
  ""It looks like the yield is still improving pretty well."",
  ""Seems like you made some good trade-offs in the quarter and continue to reinvest at higher rates."",
  ""I was just curious if you could talk about sort of the puts and takes to NII trajectory from here and if there's still room to extend duration?"",
  ""I guess the question, the Fidelis account at the end of the quarter, not the average, but the actual share count."",
  ""So as I listen to this conversation, we have to make a judgment about the quality of your decision making, Matt."",
  ""When we think about these issues, it's quite a complex market event when we think about Russia and Ukraine in particular."",
  ""So, I'm going to pass that over to Allan and Jonny talk about that in more detail."",
  ""As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the adverse development in the Specialty was driven by increases in Aviation and Aerospace in the context of the Russia-Ukraine litigation in multiple jurisdictions in the US, UK and Ireland."",
  ""This was offset by better-than-expected loss emergence in our Property D&F line of business."",
  ""Year-to-date we have seen favorable development in our Specialty portfolio of $35 million and across our entire portfolio we've seen favorable development of $146 million."",
  ""There's been no change in our approach."",
  ""We continue to employ a robust reserving methodology, maintaining a consistent approach from quarter-to-quarter and we don't change our philosophy based on a couple of quarters of lighter or heavier experience."",
  ""Specific to Russia-Ukraine again our methodologies remain the same as in the past and there's been no change in that process."",
  ""Yeah, As you can appreciate Matt, it's a complex event."",
  ""We're not able to comment further in detail and we don't disclose by line that level of detail."",
  ""Very good question, actually, Matt."",
  ""So I think, as we said before, we take lead positions across the portfolio."",
  ""We think that's very important to use the leverage that comes without the scale in terms of capacity that you offer to your clients."",
  ""So we don't all start in the same place as insurers and reinsurers."",
  ""As a leader in a verticalized market, you do get preferential terms and conditions."",
  ""So if you're putting a $1 million line out on a D&F program on a primary layer, you have a very different experience, but some of that has substantial capacity on the excess layers, specifically in D&F. So I think we are seeing a lot of opportunity on our direct property side."",
  ""We've grown 35% in the quarter."",
  ""We take a very disciplined approach, anything that doesn't meet our kind of underwriting hurdles, we're not going to compromise the integrity."",
  ""But when you think about the growth in the quarter and year-to-date, 25%, it is something we're very proud of."",
  ""Look at the combined ratio, so we do see a lot of opportunity out there, but I think it's about being nimble."",
  ""It's about the service you deliver."",
  ""It's about working harder and it's about the leverage that comes from being a leader in the market."",
  ""So it's just important to remember, we don't all start in the same place."",
  ""And I would also say we do know London very well, but we are a global business."",
  ""Good to be back and  for the question."",
  ""So I think what we have seen, we talked about D&F, the margin in D&F we thought was superior or we have seen reinsurance over the last 12 months a significant uptick in not only pricing attachment points, coverage, terms and conditions."",
  ""So you have in the UNCCL underwriting call daily, sometimes as many as three times a day, in real time we're able to compare and contrast."",
  ""And what we have seen on the reinsurance side is many more opportunities that compare favorably that have appropriate margins that we can execute on."",
  ""So that's why we've grown the business."",
  ""And we've done that whilst only moderately increasing our exposures."",
  ""So I think the two things complement each other very well."",
  ""We had a very strong pinprick approach to our D&F portfolio and again as a leader we're able to leverage terms and conditions there."",
  ""So I think it's about being nimble, we've seen a lot of opportunity."",
  ""And as I said, we've been able to grow 36% year-to-date, but only modestly increasing the exposures."",
  ""I think we look at it in a couple of ways."",
  ""When we think about strong capital position, firstly, we want to support underwriting growth, profitable underwriting growth."",
  ""So we've just been through the planning process."",
  ""I think during the course of the year, we've grown 25% and produced in really good results."",
  ""On top of that, when we think about capital management side, when we look at the book value and the share price, there's also an opportunity there."",
  ""So this year, we've been able to grow the book 25% but also give back something in the region of $141 million to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks."",
  ""So I think looking forward, on that side, is marrying those two things together because you have a strong capital position and we'll continue to do that with excess capital that we have."",
  ""I think it's too early to make predictions on growth for next year."",
  ""What we would say when we look at some of the more – or the bigger parts of the portfolio that we see, we should be able to maintain our target ratios."",
  ""So the combined ratio that's mid-80s to high-80s and that kind of 13% to 15% in an elevated market 14% to 16% ROE."",
  ""So when we look at the sectors within the business, we do think the recent cat activity will give discipline to the market."",
  ""So we expect pricing to be – terms and conditions to be consistent with what we saw this time last year."",
  ""We don't disclose that publicly."",
  ""We don't actually disclose that publicly."",
  ""We look at it exactly the same way."",
  ""We think the business is undervalued."",
  ""We appreciate we have to deliver quarter-on-quarter of good performance."",
  ""But we see an opportunity, an accretive opportunity, managing capital by buying back shares without any excess capital that we've got."",
  ""But first off, in a great market where there are very favorable terms and conditions, we want to grow profitably with our cornerstone partner."",
  "", No, I don't think specifically that we – there's just some timing between Q2 and Q3 and there is some – especially in our Bespoke segment but also in our Specialty segment, there can be some lumpiness."",
  ""So there's no real magic to what the premium will be each quarter."",
  ""And some of this is very much Hi."",
  ""As we've mentioned in prior calls and again this quarter, we continue to evaluate opportunities to repurchase shares where it's accretive and value added to our shareholders."",
  ""Platinum Ivy remains one of our long standing shareholders and we are pleased to reach a mutually beneficial transaction with them."",
  ""We can't speculate on their motivations."",
  ""From our perspective, we viewed it, as I said, as an accretive transaction."",
  ""Our shares repurchased in the quarter were 4.3 million, of which 3.25 million from ADIA."",
  ""So there were some open market purchases as well."",
  ""Yeah, specialty drove the increase in post-acquisition costs this quarter."",
  ""As soon as the commissions payable to the Fidelis Partnership, there were $122 million or 32.9 points on the combined ratio in the quarter."",
  ""This increase from prior quarters was driven due to higher variable commissions to the underlying That's exactly, is Dave."",
  ""I would say that sort of the first six months, first nine months rate of 28% to 29% is the ratio in the specialty segment and across the portfolio."",
  ""I'm going to say it's probably – we still got six weeks of this year to go I think it's a number of things."",
  ""That leadership position we talked about and it really does make a difference, but I think cross-selling – Yeah."",
  ""As I said in my prepared remarks, we're always looking to optimize our overall investment portfolio."",
  ""But yes, we're very pleased with what we've done this year."",
  ""And again, it's specifically in the quarter we decided to sell and Hi, Lee."",
  ""It's Allan here, and as in the financial statements we published at the last evening, we have share count of 111,726,363."",
  "" very much for your support, Lee."",
  "", everyone for joining us today."",
  ""We truly appreciate your interest in the company and we are pleased with our results this quarter and the strategic initiatives that position us well to continue this success."",
  ""Our unwavering commitment to delivering value to our shareholders remains at the forefront of our operations."",
  ""And if there are any follow-up questions, we are here to take your calls."",
  ""We appreciate your ongoing support."",
  ""I'll now pass it over to the operator to end the call."",
  ""Everyone, please enjoy the rest of your day."",
  ""I think it is different to primary mortgage players."",
  ""But I would say that it's something that fits well within our Bespoke portfolio as a whole and as we've said on all opportunities, if we look at outside of the Fidelis Partnership that there's a high bar that's set and we would expect them to meet or beat where the Fidelis Partnership is seeing similar types of business."",
  ""So no, that's not in relation to Hey."",
  ""We don't really view them differently to be honest."",
  ""We look at the overall combined ratio as the key metric to judge the possibility of business within the portfolio."",
  ""If I start from there and work back, then the first thing that we don't really distinguish between is loss ratio and acquisition costs."",
  ""And that's because if you look at something like the Bespoke segment, it runs a lower loss ratio but has a higher acquisition cost due to the extra expense in sourcing some of that business in comparison to, say, specialty, which has got a bit of a lower acquisition cost on much of the business in there, but a slightly higher loss ratio."",
  ""Then breaking it back to step to the loss ratio, we show it you guys have got the information here, but I don't really draw much of a distinction between attritional and Yeah, I, I think that's still true."",
  ""There is a benign attritional activity over the year when we compared to where we were last year."",
  ""But it's also impacted by a couple of losses this year, going just over the threshold and therefore going into the""

  ""...I can say that at least."",
  "" a lot for that color."",
  ""And let me start with saying the obvious, this has been a difficult quarter."",
  ""I know there is a lot of shareholders out there that are frustrated and has been unhappy with the development."",
  ""And of course, we also don't like when the share price drops as it has done."",
  ""I think we'll go through the presentation quite quickly, so that we have a bit more time for Q&A. But I may be able to already now say the main statement, I have changed no opinion on our future."",
  ""I have the same opinion about the merger between Enauta and 3R. I really believe this is going to be a fantastic transaction for 3R. What we have seen is a set of delays, and we're going to go through this in more details as I go through the presentation."",
  ""And I'm very prepared to answer your questions, which I'm sure are also related to this later on."",
  ""But have faith in this."",
  ""I really believe this can turn out to be very good also for Maha going forward."",
  ""So with this, let's go through the presentation."",
  ""So, on this page, not much to really add here."",
  ""I think the most important thing that happened this quarter was the fact that we finally had the change of control approval from PDVSA, from the Venezuelan government."",
  ""I also met with the Vice President, Delcy Rodríguez, in Venezuela."",
  ""She was ensuring me that they would focus on getting all the approvals in place and that we'll get the Chevron model to work with in Venezuela going forward."",
  ""And I think that was the most important thing in this quarter."",
  ""Brava is essential this quarter."",
  ""Let's go through exactly this page here, where, bit of the background for what did we believe in."",
  ""And that is still here."",
  ""I think there is a company with an enormous resource base, 700 million barrels of 2P reserves."",
  ""There is a potential here to produce up to and more than 100,000 barrels per day."",
  ""All of this is fully invested already."",
  ""I know there's been concerns out there with the CapEx level and so on that will be related to new projects to further increase."",
  ""And what we come back to later on in our communication also is that this is not necessary in order to reach 100,000 barrels per day."",
  ""And we believe the company should now focus on maintaining this production level and make sure that we generate a lot of cash."",
  ""It's a cash-generating portfolio unless we decide to grow even more quickly."",
  ""And that has been our message to the company that we should be careful with that going forward."",
  ""I would also mention the more than $1 billion in synergies that were taken out."",
  ""So this company has a good balance of onshore and offshore."",
  ""It has a very good balance sheet."",
  ""And I'm really very firm in my belief that we can easily get to the 100,000 barrels per day production and maintain that for a long period, and it's going to generate significant cash flow going forward."",
  ""So this, I think, is the name of the game."",
  ""And then if you go to next page, more explaining a bit what has happened, what did we pass through?"",
  ""And it has been a challenging quarter in the sense of delays for the Papa Terra to come back into production after having the planned maintenance stop as they did."",
  ""So this was also caused partly by the regulator having almost too much to do, I would say, also having internal work conflicts with strikes and so on."",
  ""But also, there were some things on the FPSO that was not meeting the standards."",
  ""I would say, however, that the company did have an authorization from the Navy to have the number of board people that they had."",
  ""But still, ANP as the regulator, kind of overruled the permission given by the Navy."",
  ""And this was, of course, unfortunate and unforeseen, and caused further delay for the startup of the Papa Terra."",
  ""So, but now we do expect and I have been through this in as much detail as I can be, being the representative of the industrial largest owner in Brava."",
  ""And I don't see any reason why this thing should not come back into production according to what the company is saying in December this year."",
  ""Then I would also say that Atlanta, of course, maybe even more important, was, of course, the delay in Atlanta."",
  ""Atlanta has a production capacity of between 30,000 barrels and maybe up to 50,000 barrels when it comes back on stream."",
  ""And they have the new FPSO."",
  ""It's all linked up, all the wells are now connected."",
  ""The only thing they basically need is, again, the final go ahead from the regulator."",
  ""And this has again taken more time than what was foreseen."",
  ""It's a delay, but it doesn't change anything of the fundamentals of the quality of the assets."",
  ""So, again, the regulator is not going to inspect this within a couple of weeks."",
  ""The company and myself do expect that the production will then be coming on stream as normal, and we'll see and a huge jump in the production."",
  ""There could be all sorts of minor issues also when you start up the production."",
  ""But this is, basically I think that we will see a very quick boost in the production from Atlanta once it comes on stream."",
  ""I think also the fact that during this delay, there was the closing of the transaction with Westlawn."",
  ""I happen to have a breakfast with the CEO in Westlawn the same day as that closing, and I asked him, are you concerned because my shareholders are concerned?"",
  ""And he said, no, I'm really not concerned."",
  ""We have done a very good due diligence."",
  ""We know this FPSO very well."",
  ""We know it's going to come into production."",
  ""And the guy put up a value equal $1.5 billion for these assets at the same day, knowing the delays, knowing everything had the huge confidence in this."",
  ""I have every confidence that this FPSO will come on stream and will produce very well for the company going forward."",
  ""So the last page – or next page on Brava, please."",
  ""So here is more what our view is."",
  ""And as I said, we are a well-respected shareholder, the largest industrial owner in Brava and we have a somewhat clear view about what should happen here."",
  ""And I think perhaps part of the issue over the last quarter has also been, I would say, some – perhaps I would phrase it as inexperienced or at least not super clear communication from the company about what's going to happen forward."",
  ""This company has a lot of possibilities going forward."",
  ""But I think our message to the company now is less focus on growth, much more focus on harvest."",
  ""There is a fantastic cash flow to be generated."",
  ""Make sure that the shareholder benefit from it."",
  ""I think – also be willing to and actually actively look into management of the portfolio."",
  ""I think there are assets here that are not necessarily best taken care of in the context of Brava, not because they don't have the people to do it, but it's just another sort of business."",
  ""So I won't take the decision on their behalf on really what can be laid off or what can be partly outsourced to other companies."",
  ""But I think the possibilities are there."",
  ""And I think that that is something very natural to do after a huge period of very successful growth, now this focus to really make sure that we continue with the right assets."",
  ""So this has been my message to Brava, and I think they're picking up on it."",
  ""I think that goes hand-in-hand with the CapEx optimization."",
  ""I think it is important that the company is really focused on maintaining the production and try to push the further growth."",
  ""I think it's okay to wait for growth."",
  ""We don't need, as a shareholder, to see 150,000 barrels here as soon as possible."",
  ""What we need is dividend."",
  ""So basically repaying debt, repaying the shareholders, paying dividend has been a super important message from us to the company."",
  ""And what I do think has happened over this very challenging quarter is that I think there has been a significant alignment between the shareholders towards the board and towards the management on this issue."",
  ""So now I think coming out of this challenging quarter with an alignment from shareholder to board and management that this is the right path going forward."",
  ""So I remain very optimistic on what's going to happen with Brava."",
  ""Actually I think it's realistic because they will get this production, I have no doubts about it."",
  ""And I think the alignment will also generates kind of belief in the market that the significant amount of this cash that will be generated will actually be paid back to the investors."",
  ""So let's go to the rest."",
  ""Yeah, sorry, I almost forgot about this."",
  ""This is maybe the most important thing."",
  ""What do we actually believe in the cash flow generation here?"",
  ""So what we see over the next six years is that this company has the capacity to pay up to three times the current market cap."",
  ""$1.45 billion can be paid in dividend over this period."",
  ""And I think our numbers are fairly modest."",
  ""Looking at the production curve there, that our estimate is, and I underline this is our estimates, and compared to what the company has communicated to us, there won't be reserves."",
  ""So this is not us trying to boost the numbers by being unrealistically high on the production curve or anything like this."",
  ""This is super realistic numbers."",
  ""And I think this will generate an incredible cash flow and generate a fantastic dividend capacity."",
  ""And with the new alignment, I'm very sure that also the Maha shareholders will benefit from this once we get there."",
  ""So, let's move on to the next."",
  ""I think this is the main part of my presentation here."",
  ""I think Illinois is continuing to grow."",
  ""We have drilled three good wells this year."",
  ""We are now going to analyze properly how these last six, seven wells have behaved in order to see what will be our next steps in this region before we take any more decision."",
  ""So, no more news here, things are going fine."",
  ""I'm very happy to also say that the guys in Illinois, two guys are running the whole show."",
  ""We have had no incidents whatsoever on the HSE."",
  ""I'm very proud of the guys working in Illinois."",
  ""On Venezuela, I think also not very much to say here."",
  ""We have the approval, as I already mentioned."",
  ""We are continuing with our plan."",
  ""We are waiting for the outcome of the offer for the final negotiations on the contract terms, getting the Chevron model in the contracts with Venezuela."",
  ""And of course, we need OFAC license."",
  ""And I would say, goes without saying, again that we have two elections, now, one in Venezuela, one in the US that at least for some people had a bit surprising outcome."",
  ""And I think that has caused – I think it's a reasonable assumption assuming that this will cause – could cause some delays."",
  ""But I'm not really great concerned."",
  ""I know this will come up on the questions."",
  ""So I'll wait with some of my obvious statements when we get there."",
  ""But I still believe that we have a fantastic project in Venezuela."",
  ""I believe it's in the interest of the Venezuelan government for sure to keep us there."",
  ""And I actually do believe that the US government, also the new administration, will see that they are better fit with having companies like Maha operating there than not having that."",
  ""So with that, I think I hand it over to you, Roberto, to go through quickly the numbers, and then we can take some more questions."",
  ""Kjetil, Roberto, nice to see you again."",
  ""How are things in sunny Brazil?"",
  ""Nice to see you again, Kaarlo."",
  ""Right, well, it's another eventful quarter."",
  ""So please take it away."",
  ""It's a pleasure to be here again with you."",
  ""So, starting about the production revenue, so, as you can see, we have been increasing the production quarter-over-quarter after we finished this and put on screen all these new wells that Kjetil was mentioning."",
  ""And we increased from third quarter last year around 50%."",
  ""And as we speak, by the end of October, we already reached productions around 400 barrels related to Illinois Basin asset."",
  ""And this, of course, as a consequence, have also increased our revenues."",
  ""And even though we have this decline on oil price environment, we also have this increase when compared to last year third quarter."",
  ""So, going through the next page, here we present you the OpEx and netback performances."",
  ""It's important to note, we have been increasing our efficiency, as Kjetil also mentioned."",
  ""So basically we slightly increased our costs in the quarter, but we also have a substantial reduction on the OpEx per barrel unit."",
  ""So if you look, we decreased around 23% if you compared to last year third quarter."",
  ""And these, of course, we will have a better and higher netback in total amount and also in terms of netback per barrel."",
  ""So going through the next slide, and now talking about the whole company."",
  ""I think it's important to show that we have been working hard to reduce our G&A expenses across the last quarters."",
  ""And now we are showing also the discontinuated operations costs, because that was related to the other operations that we are going to sell or sold in the past quarters."",
  ""And also, it's important to note we have been facing several non-recurring expenses mainly related to these projects in Venezuela and looking for other good opportunities for generating value for our shareholders."",
  ""And by the end of this quarter, we ended up with negative $1.5 million EBITDA of the continuous operations."",
  ""So, going through the next slide, and here I think it's important to show and talk about the net financial result, which is basically related to Brava share price volatility, which were going to be exposed to the next quarters moving forward."",
  ""We face a unrealized loss of around $40 million because of the Brava share price has been declining."",
  ""But also related to roll-up, we also recognize $80 million gain approximately, classified as not continued operation, but that was reducing the negative impact of the 3R share price on the final net result of the quarter."",
  ""So, going through the next page, I think this is an important update as well."",
  ""So basically November, going back to August, I don't know if you remember, but we issued a margin loan debt with a Brazilian bank where we provided Brava's shares as collateral."",
  ""And as the price has been declining, we have to grant additional cash collateral to cover these margin calls, and this would result in higher cost of debt and less flexibility in terms of available cash."",
  ""So then we decided to not transfer these additional cash collaterals, and the bank made the early termination because of this default."",
  ""And then we decided to go through this early amortization, and basically we have now a debt-free balance sheet going after November."",
  ""And here, just to summarize our main highlights from the balance sheet."",
  ""Basically we end up in September with $25.6 million in cash and equivalents and also $77 million of liquid investments, which are basically Brava shares and also our 3R Offshore debenture, ending up with a total amount of net cash plus liquid investments of around $88 million."",
  ""So going through the next slide, here I think it's important to remember our cash balance up-to-date."",
  ""So we started the quarter with around $78 million of cash plus liquid investments and we ended up the quarter with $88 million approximately of net cash plus liquid investments, mainly as a result of the Brava shares overlap and also the unrealized loss regarding Brava shares price decline."",
  ""So, going through the next slide and as closing remarks, so we ended up with $88 million in net cash plus liquid investments, mainly because we also considered as subsequent event this repayment of our margin loan with Safra to avoid having this implying higher cost of debt."",
  ""And we have now a solid capital structure with debt-free balance sheet going forward."",
  ""And looking forward, in the future we are also working with OFAC license and other approvals so we can start to have as soon as possible our project in Venezuela."",
  ""We are also working with Brava shareholders so the company can focus on the existing portfolio, the existing core business and the leverage and thinking on dividends for the shareholders."",
  ""And also, of course, we also continue to keep working and looking for other accretive opportunities, mainly focused on Latin America so we can bring other good deals and projects to Maha."",
  ""So that now I think that we close here the closing remarks."",
  ""We can go through the Q&A section.""
]","[
  ""But by all means, I mean, I'm not a US policy expert."",
  ""But I think the main things I would underline is like, this is not just kind of guess works on my behalf sitting in Rio."",
  ""We've had a lot of meetings with the State Department."",
  ""We also met with the representatives of the Republicans."",
  ""We met with people that are fairly close to the new President elect."",
  ""So, I feel like my basis for saying what I'm saying is, yeah, kind of more profound."",
  ""So I think it is, of course, a certain uncertainty on how soon things will happen and what actually will happen."",
  ""But I think we have a president elect that everybody assumes is a guy that wants to cut deals."",
  ""So I think he wants to – there could be times here where he would push and press and so on."",
  ""But I think basically, I expect that that's the feedback I get that he would love to cut a deal."",
  ""And I think that there is very little logic in basically just stopping the production from Venezuela."",
  ""I don't see that as a very logic response."",
  ""So I remain kind of cautious."",
  ""I think it could take some more time."",
  ""But I think that the direction I would basically expect that it will be a similar type of direction with perhaps a bit more bumpy rides to get there."",
  ""But let me just underline... ...one point... ...in this, and that is important in a way that we have not started applying a lot of capital into Venezuela now."",
  ""So basically our situation now is still a bit like we are preparing and all the work we're now doing is necessary to be done anyway."",
  ""But we are still not in a phase where we could just turn on the switch and invest $10 million, $15 million, $20 million into Venezuela."",
  ""We would anyway need to build our models to make sure that when we are getting all the approvals that we actually invest the money in the right way."",
  ""So, right now, we are really not losing anything."",
  ""We are maybe losing, in people's mind, some time, and perhaps we could have spent more money on – and getting – pushing this to start up earlier."",
  ""But really, we're not spending money."",
  ""We're not losing money here."",
  ""We have delays in starting up, if anything."",
  ""Oh, yeah – I would first say that I think Venezuela is going to play out."",
  ""So I don't accept the premises of the question, so to speak."",
  ""But, of course, the question is fair."",
  ""So, and yes, we are also looking into other opportunities."",
  ""And I always said, we know Brazil better than anyone."",
  ""We think we know quite a lot of opportunities in Latin America in general."",
  ""So, yes, rest assured, there is not a lack of opportunities that will not stop us."",
  ""No, for the time being, I think we're very pleased with what we have seen in the US."",
  ""It's not a very big operation, but it's been very profitable and been giving a good return to us as we speak."",
  ""Very pleased with the operations, so as I said, without any incidents and whatsoever in operating all the assets."",
  ""So I'm very happy to continue doing investments in Illinois."",
  ""But it's not going to – there's no company maker project in Illinois."",
  ""It's basically a business that gives us a nice return and keeps us busy operating in the region."",
  ""What I mentioned and I will underline again, is that we're going to go through this."",
  ""I'm going there now in the beginning of December, and then we're going to go through, okay, what are the results now?"",
  ""How can we potentially improve?"",
  ""And then kind of evaluate the whole situation in the region, whether we're going to grow more."",
  ""And then look at – yeah, basically look at all the alternatives."",
  ""But I'm very impressed with the guys working there, I must say."",
  ""I think it's – I can understand that it's kind of can be perceived as an easy answer and so on."",
  ""But – and well, there isn't so much more to say."",
  ""I think that the FPSOs, there are basically two big platforms here that we are talking about."",
  ""And of course, the production capacity of these two platforms is something like 50, 60, maybe more 1,000 barrels per day."",
  ""So, of course, it's vital for the company that these two machines, if you like, are working properly."",
  ""So I've been on board on the Papa Terra."",
  ""And I know people working on the Papa Terra."",
  ""I know people working with the Atlanta."",
  ""We have been through it."",
  ""We have seen the investor Westlawn came in."",
  ""I'm very comfortable that these problems – these things happens."",
  ""We are in an industry where delays happen, where accidents happens, where – yeah, where you have to basically stop for a longer period of time to fix some of these things that actually popped up on the Papa Terra and are being delayed in Atlanta."",
  ""These things happen from time to time."",
  ""That both of these two things happened just after the merger I think was very unfortunate, because I think it created some doubts about what's happening here and so on."",
  ""I don't think there is much happening."",
  ""I think this is basically how it is, and I'm very confident that these two platforms will come back on stream and they will produce the oil that we all are expecting to come and that's it really."",
  ""Quite boring story, but that's how I see it."",
  "" Yes, I think that that's – and I think it's – actually, I think it's a modest number."",
  ""I think that it could – of course, again, you can have further delays, which I do not expect."",
  ""I do expect these two FPSOs to come back on stream in December."",
  ""So I think there could be – there are lots of things that can happen."",
  ""But I think the expectation is that I would actually not be surprised if we end up producing 110,000 barrels next year and not 100,000 barrels."",
  ""I think it's a modest number."",
  ""I don't want to also create an expectation that it's going to be much more."",
  ""But I think it's – as an optimist or as a caution optimist, I would say that I think the production rather will be higher than lower than 100,000 barrels next year."",
  ""No, first of all, I would underline that, I think we have said that on several occasions that collaboration between myself and the investors that I have been working with in DBO and Starboard is exceptionally good."",
  ""So we have been working very close together since we started up the 3R and we made the first investment there together."",
  ""So this is a very strong and good relationship."",
  ""We are discussing all the time how to move forward."",
  ""I think we're very aligned on the strategy."",
  ""And I'm very happy that we have an owner that basically now also steps up when there is a lot of doubts about – well, in the market."",
  ""And they say, well, we believe in this."",
  ""They show it by adding more money into the company."",
  ""So I'm super pleased with the way Starboard is reacting."",
  ""I'm very comfortable with their targets and approach."",
  ""I think they have now a significant stake also for them as investor into the company."",
  ""So, I think we as or all shareholders should be super happy to have a shareholder like Starboard backing the company also in times of concern, in times of doubts and so on."",
  ""I think they are living up to the expectation of a majority owner that basically demonstrates that they believes in the assets, believes in the company and that's very good."",
  ""I'm super happy with it."",
  ""Roberto, do you want to have a go at repayment maybe?"",
  ""I think I can generalize it a bit of saying, well, first of all, I think what Roberto has demonstrated is, of course, in spite of also them deciding that we want to repay this debt, which was kind of a fairly easy decision for us, because it was just getting expensive and we had it in the first place in order to have more flexibility, also with the expectation that perhaps if Venezuela, so all of a sudden turn around and would develop very quickly, that we would be ready to move quickly on it."",
  ""Now, our call is like we just talked about, I think things could take more time."",
  ""So, basically we felt like we don't need this extra cash."",
  ""But I also think that when it comes to the buyback, of course, in a time where we have all this question marks and so on, I understand the board that they – we haven't stopped the program."",
  ""We want to continue the program."",
  ""We like the share buyback program."",
  ""But I think, let's get to a more, how can I say, sail into more calm waters before we really start up perhaps again."",
  ""I think that's maybe their main concern."",
  ""And I think it's being precautious, being cautious on the liquidity and all this, makes a lot of sense."",
  ""But I would underline immediately that we have more than enough capital to all our commitments."",
  ""We can start up in Venezuela."",
  ""We have all this capital that we need."",
  ""So, but still, let's be cautious and see when we can start up again."",
  ""We haven't stopped the program, but we want to – I think the board wants to consider all these, yeah, movements, so put it that way, before they actively start up again the program."",
  ""I mean, for me personally, as a big shareholder, I have all my wealth in this."",
  ""I have no interest in having a share issue at this levels."",
  ""No, so the PetroUrdaneta, next payment there is basically in a year from now, November in 2025."",
  ""I think this has been somewhat unclear before."",
  ""So I do apologize for that."",
  ""But basically, all our contractual rights are secured until November next year, where we then are expected to pay another $5 million."",
  ""What we are also doing, I would say, is that we're, of course, negotiating now."",
  ""We want to take the whole 100%."",
  ""So basically, we are trying to negotiate with Novonor also on how we could move forward with 100% of this and not having them as a partner at all."",
  ""And I think I would rather say that I would expect that to happen before we pay the $5 million as mentioned."",
  ""We don't any plans to do anything about that."",
  ""Now, I think if that were to happen, and this is not an active discussion."",
  ""But I think the fact is, of course, that there are not so many oil companies at the Swedish Stock Exchange."",
  ""And one other company was recently bought by a Australian, Chinese-owned company and probably will not be listed anymore, so I understand correctly."",
  ""So, of course, we can feel a bit lonely, but there are also complications in delisting."",
  ""It's not an actual thing being discussed right now."",
  ""I think if something like this happened, it would happen I think in a larger context, where it would be linked to our business."",
  ""Yeah, I don't think we want to spend time on delisting just because we are unhappy."",
  ""I'm actually – I quite enjoy going to Stockholm."",
  ""And I think we have some very engaged shareholders in Stockholm, which they ask challenging questions and they do submit it off the e-mails."",
  ""But I actually like it."",
  ""I like the engagement, and I think you're always welcome to send me."",
  ""For obvious reasons, I cannot respond to everything."",
  ""But I actually like the engagement and I look forward to going there in January where we are planning a longer session and full day with basically opening up for informed dialogue and questions and so on."",
  ""So I hope to see a lot of you shareholders in January."",
  ""I think – well, let's come back to that in details."",
  ""I'll discuss that with IR."",
  ""But like I said, I think that this dialogue with the shareholders is very good."",
  ""I think I have understood that there's lot of frustration."",
  ""I think that let's see how things are moving forward."",
  ""I remain very confident about the decisions we have taken."",
  ""I remain very confident about Brava."",
  ""I remain very confident about the development in Venezuela."",
  ""And of course, we all have to – the proof is in the eating, so to speak."",
  ""So let's get there and then we can, of course, talk more about it."",
  ""But I'm looking forward to go to Stockholm, yes."",
  "" a lot to you."",
  ""Well, Kjetil and Roberto,  for that, snappy, despite a very eventful quarter."",
  ""And as always, we received a couple of questions or a lot, I should say, ahead of this presentation."",
  ""I think you have touched upon them."",
  ""So there will be a little bit of a repetition on those."",
  ""But if we look at Venezuela, and Kjetil, you gave us your point of view here where you are more or less – well, I would say, I mean, the new government in – well, the new old government in Venezuela will probably be on track for you, as is concerned."",
  ""And if I understood you correctly, you don't really expect any major changes from the US new administration."",
  ""Was that a correct take?"",
  ""So, I mean, your target for an increase of, what, 1,000 barrels a day up to 20,000 barrels is still intact?"",
  ""It's just a timeline where you are slightly out of control, which is fair, given the fact that you're neither running Venezuela nor the US."",
  ""So you're committing capital on back of the actual facts rather than the speculation here, which... ...seems to be a sound strategy here."",
  ""If Venezuela doesn't play out the way you strongly believe, I'm just reading the question here, how do you see value creation going forward?"",
  ""And maybe another way to look at it, do you look elsewhere for opportunistic investments?"",
  ""And you mentioned Latin America and Brazil, but how should we regard the US assets, Illinois here?"",
  ""Expand or sail or just have it pumping and giving you a cash flow?"",
  ""And we obviously have received a lot of questions regarding Brava, and I think you had a fairly extended explanation to it."",
  ""But if I may and see whether I can summarize it here, I mean, basically, your fundamentals hasn't changed in Brava."",
  ""It's just the timeline that had been pushed further out."",
  ""Is that the way you would like to communicate to the market here?"",
  ""And if I recall your slides correct here, you haven't really changed your estimates regarding barrels per day for 2025."",
  ""So you're at, what, 100,000 barrels and... Yeah."",
  ""Your largest owner has now acquired over 25% over this period where you had your problems with the deliverance from Brava, I may add."",
  ""So they have increased their holding in you."",
  ""How do they – well, obviously, it's difficult for you to comment, owners here, but how do they see themselves as owner in the long-term?"",
  ""What's the discussions like in the – when they meet you or you meet them?"",
  ""So, yeah, I mean, there's a lot of reasons why people will sell, but there's probably only one when they will buy and they put their money where their mouth is."",
  ""Repayment of debt, walk us through the thinking here and the pause in the share buyback?"",
  ""So, basically when we were passing through the slides, we show a little bit, but basically in August, we issued this margin loan of $50 million, and that's collateral, we gave them Brava shares."",
  ""So, by the end of this quarter and going forward in October, November, Brava share price has been declining and the bank request Maha to deploy additional cash collaterals."",
  ""So in that case, we would have less cash to use and also the same interest on top of the $50 million debt."",
  ""So basically we have a implied higher cost of debt going forward, so we decided not to transfer this additional cash costs and we need to repay the debt, so we can be Through the financial movement?"",
  ""Do you want to talk about the buybacks, Kjetil?"",
  ""So this is not It's the other way around, one could argue?"",
  ""And when do you need to pay your second instalment to Novoro (sic) [Novonor] (00:37:07) in order to keep exclusivity in PetroUrdaneta?"",
  ""And I apologize for my pronunciation of the company name there."",
  ""I'll have two final questions here."",
  ""And the first one is you're still planning on being listing on the Swedish Stock Exchange?"",
  "" for that, Kjetil, because that would be my next question and I think you already jumped into that."",
  ""The next news flow, basically, apart from the press releases, if there is any development, would be you or the management turning up here in mid-January for a shareholder meeting, open for anyone who is interested or just the shareholders?"",
  ""Well, Kjetil, Roberto, it's been a pleasure."",
  ""It's been informative and interesting."",
  ""And we'll watch this place and we'll see you later.""

81,3131632,063GYR-E,2024-11-14,"[
  ""Hi, everybody, and welcome to quarter three report presentation of Surgical Science, which is also the first quarterly report presented by me, Tom Englund, as the new CEO of the company."",
  ""Next to me here in the studio I have Anna Ahlberg, our company CFO."",
  ""We will use the time today to first present the report and then we will take questions from the audience."",
  ""To start off with, the Q3 report is a result that me and the Surgical Science team are quite pleased with."",
  ""We saw currency adjusted growth of 12% versus previous quarter three, with an EBIT margin of 20%."",
  ""And we see a generally positive development across the entire business."",
  ""As you know, we have two different business areas, Educational Products and Industry/OEM."",
  ""And it's great to see that both of our business areas are now growing."",
  ""Educational Products grew 2% versus quarter three last year and 17% growth versus previous quarter, which means an accelerating growth."",
  ""And Industrial/OEM grew with a strong 22% versus same quarter last year."",
  ""Looking a little bit deeper into Educational Products, during the second quarter, we said that the turnaround had come for Educational Products and that we saw an increased customer activity and greater pipelines than before."",
  ""It's good to see that this turnaround continued in quarter three with plus 2% versus last year and 17% growth versus previous second quarter."",
  ""All regions grew on a slightly different pace."",
  ""Europe was up 49%, North America plus 4%, and Europe plus 6% versus previous quarter."",
  ""Last quarter, we said that it's a question mark whether the business area will show growth for the full year."",
  ""And that is partly depended on whether we received a large tender."",
  ""We can now say that the large tender will not affect quarter four regardless of outcome."",
  ""And this means that we don't see that we will show growth for the full year."",
  ""We, however, feel very confident about the growth prospects of Educational Products for 2025 and beyond."",
  ""Moving into Industry/OEM, we saw solid growth of 22% revenue growth, which is a continuation of the strong development we have had in the business area in the previous quarters."",
  ""This business area consist of simulator sales to med device companies as well as software simulation packages to robotic surgery companies."",
  ""If we look at sales of simulators, it increased by 82% to SEK 26 million."",
  ""And so far this year, simulator sales have grown a whopping 182% to SEK 84 million."",
  ""We see a clear trend among customers to consider our simulators to be business critical for a wider range of functions and disciplines within their company."",
  ""That means that simulators are now actively being used in departments such as education, sales and marketing as well as R&D. And this in turn means that the number of simulators per customer is increasing."",
  ""And during the quarter, we also delivered the first units of our ultraportable simulator to a very important industry customer of ours."",
  ""Dev revs, developmental revenues, contracted by 20% to SEK 9 million."",
  ""This revenue is lumpy in nature, but we remain confident in the growth and we have a very healthy pipeline of projects for the coming 12 months."",
  ""Looking deeper at the license revenues, they increased by 17% to SEK 65 million."",
  ""We had a solid development during the quarter of our license revenues and it's very positive for us to see that the robotics market is developing, with more entrants now getting closer to start active sales or marketing of their products."",
  ""Distalmotion and CMR Surgical announced that they had received FDA approval for certain procedures, and Johnson & Johnson, one of the world's largest medtech companies, had filed for and just received an IDE approval for their Ottava systems, which is the step before the actual FDA approval."",
  ""These new entrants, who also are customer of ours, will drive robotics market growth and in turn the training needs for robotics and therefore the demand for simulation."",
  ""Regarding dV5, we have no further news than what we already shared in the second quarter."",
  ""Intuitive is targeting a full launch of the dV5 system during mid-2025 and is currently conducting a controlled pre-launch to selected customers."",
  ""These systems are equipped with clinical software only and do not have simulation on them completely according to plan."",
  ""And to finish-off, Intuitive is an esteemed customer of us, and we are working hard to ensure that Intuitive has a great digital experience, including simulation in time for the full launch of the dV5."",
  ""I have now been in the formal position for six weeks and before that on a six-week introduction period, together with Gisli Hennermark, the previous CEO."",
  ""And during these first weeks in the company, I have spent a lot of time with the team and with our customers to understand the ins and outs and the market that we operate in."",
  ""I've had the opportunity to work alongside Gisli, who has been invaluable in the handover period, and one, on the slide there to your right, the lower-right picture, you can see a picture from one of our introduction meetings in our office in Tel Aviv."",
  ""And my focus on top of understanding the company and relationship building internally and externally has been to develop a plan and goals to help us achieve our short-term growth ambitions and longer-term market-leading ambitions that we have for Surgical Science."",
  ""As we now look towards 2025, I'm filled with excitement and energy for the continued growth journey."",
  ""We have world-leading products, a super-strong, highly-engaged and global team."",
  ""We have the stability and brand of a market leader, and we operate in a growing and rapidly developing market with prominent customers."",
  ""We have challenges mainly related to our ability to handle rapid customer growth and operational scalability."",
  ""But these are challenges that I feel confident that we will be able to handle, and addressing these challenges will also help us build a much bigger and much more successful company."",
  ""And with that, I would like to hand over the word to Anna to go over the financial numbers."",
  ""So starting with revenues per business area, as Tom said, we show growth for both our business areas, and our total sales was up 10% to just below SEK 232 million."",
  ""In local currencies, it was up 12%."",
  ""And this is the first quarter in a very long time that we have had negative FX effects."",
  ""As I'm sure most of you know, we are heavily dependent on, above all, the US dollar, where we have over 80% of our sales in that currency."",
  ""And of course, with translation differences, we are also dependent on the shekel."",
  ""Educational Products, as Tom said, in our Q2 report, we talked about the turnaround that we saw for Educational Products, and we continue to see and feel this momentum."",
  ""We had some weak quarters before and a very weak Q1, but we now continue to see money flowing into the system, even though the picture is a bit different between different geographies."",
  ""Sales was up 2% compared to Q3 last year, but 17% compared to the last quarter, Q2."",
  ""For Asia, we saw good increase over Q3 last year and a smaller increase compared to Q2."",
  ""China, an important market for us, and it's been affected by the anticorruption campaign for quite some time, and we are still cautious to say that it's over."",
  ""But sales there were on par compared to Q3 last year, a bit lower than Q2 though."",
  ""The market that showed the strongest growth both in when you look at Q3 last year as well as Q2 with India, and we also commented on India before, because that market was affected by the election taking place, that affected both Q1 and Q2."",
  ""But now the administration is in place and we see very good development."",
  ""Europe, as Tom mentioned, plus 49% compared to Q2 and plus 10% compared to Q3 last year."",
  ""And if we look at the markets where we had the strongest development, and as we talked about also before, the money flowing into Eastern Europe, we see Poland and Bulgaria being very strong for the quarter."",
  ""North America, plus 4% compared to Q2 and lower than Q3 last year."",
  ""The US market was on par, but we had a larger order in Brazil last year that affected the comparison numbers."",
  ""Industry/OEM, up 22%, and license revenues ended at SEK 65 million, up 17%."",
  ""We also see the continued very strong development for our simulator sales within Industry/OEM, plus 82%, ending at SEK 26 million."",
  ""Development revenues were down slightly."",
  ""I will come back to that on the next slide, where we see our different revenue streams, and you have them also divided by business area in the report."",
  ""License revenues, up as we talked about, and also then as a percentage of total revenues, 28% compared to 26% Q3 last year."",
  ""Emphasizing, again, and as always, this is lumpy for new entrants since they purchase their licenses in batches."",
  ""And we have seen for 2024 that sales of new packages has been weaker than last year due to new entrants."",
  ""Our simulator sales, if we combine simulator sales within Educational Products and Industry/OEM, this was the strongest that we've had since Q4 2022."",
  ""And it was plus 10% compared to Q3 last year and plus 18% compared to Q2."",
  ""Development revenues, as I mentioned then a bit weaker if we compare to Q3 last year."",
  ""But as you can see, that was also very, very strong quarter if you compare to the other quarters in 2023 and it was still a bit stronger than in Q2."",
  ""This is Industry – development revenues is all within Industry/OEM and it consists of both robotics projects as well as projects tied to sales of simulators."",
  ""Moving on to look at our costs and the EBIT margin for the quarter, our gross margin was 69%, same as in Q3 last year, a bit stronger than in Q2 when we had 68%, despite the fact that we had a higher share of license revenues in Q2."",
  ""And this is then due to the volume factor that we had higher volume of simulators, meaning that fixed costs are then distributed on a higher number of simulators."",
  ""Comparing to Q3 last year, the increased share of license revenues has a positive effect on the gross margin."",
  ""We also had a favorable product mix."",
  ""However, our average sales price was slightly lower."",
  ""Sales costs, they were a bit higher than last year, but on par with Q2."",
  ""We had in Q3 a lower activity regarding when it comes to congresses and trade fairs then in Q1 and Q2."",
  ""And that is the pattern we have every year."",
  ""The lower costs due to this were offset by the fact that we in the quarter had higher agent fees."",
  ""And that is really dependent on where we sell during the quarter, 18% of sales, same as Q3 last year."",
  ""Administration costs were on par with last year and a bit lower than Q2, 8% of sales."",
  ""And then R&D costs, they were a bit higher than Q2 and significantly approximately SEK 10 million higher than Q3 last year."",
  ""We continue to invest in our R&D organization."",
  ""We continue to employ skilled software developers."",
  ""We also activated less, and that depends on what we are working on, what type of projects."",
  ""And we also, as I mentioned before, had less development revenues."",
  ""And that means that we move less costs to cost of goods sold."",
  ""So it becomes a bit technical here, but you can find our R&D costs in three different lines, the cost of goods sold, the actual R&D line, and then in the balance sheet where we activate."",
  ""If we combine these and look at the total R&D costs, we see that they did not increase SEK 10 million, they increased SEK 5 million from SEK 58 million to SEK 63 million."",
  ""The item other consist primarily of options or option programs and FX effects."",
  ""And in Q3, we had a larger effect when it comes to the option program and that is attributable to the new program that was approved by the AGM in May."",
  ""And that is the Swedish part of the program where the participants get the premium as a bonus and we pay social costs on them, and it's also the IFRS2 effect."",
  ""And that was the same now in Q3 this year as in Q3 last year, but it's a higher effect in Q3 than previous quarters."",
  ""Organization, going out of Q3 this year, we were 270 employees in the company compared to 260 going out of Q3 last year."",
  ""And you can see the split between the different sites down to the right."",
  ""The adjusted EBIT margin for the quarter was 22% compared to 27% in Q3 last year and up from Q2 when it was 19%."",
  ""And for the nine month period, we had an adjusted EBIT margin where we then adjust, we have the EBIT and we adjust for costs attributable to our acquisitions, amortizations and depreciations."",
  ""The margin was 20% for the nine-month period compared to 26% last year."",
  ""Our finance net was a positive SEK 7 million."",
  ""Most of that is attributable to interest on our bank balances."",
  ""And then we also have items related to revaluation of internal loans to our subsidiaries and an IFRS 16 effect."",
  ""The net result for the quarter was SEK 43 million."",
  ""Our cash flow for the quarter was a bit weaker than what we have been used to."",
  ""From operating activities, it was a plus of SEK 22 million."",
  ""In that amount, we have a minus of SEK 9.4 million due to the fact that we paid out taxes in Israel on a previous financial year."",
  ""And then we had a negative change in working capital, amounting to SEK 32 million."",
  ""Inventory changed marginally, however, our accounts receivables increased significantly."",
  ""I usually talk about accounts receivables and the work that we always do on that."",
  ""We've been working very diligently on it for quite some time and we had a very big positive effect after getting the AR stock from 3D Systems when we acquired Simbionix."",
  ""And then we continued to work on that and we've had a very nice development, and especially in the US, which is our largest direct market, where that's always something to work on."",
  ""And so, of course, I've said before that I don't think that this will decrease much more if we look at the percentage – accounts receivables as a percentage of rolling 12 month sales."",
  ""But of course, we would not like it to go up."",
  ""We don't see any general increasing trend or any cause for concern."",
  ""It's more a timing issue that when orders and payments come in, we had quite significant amounts falling due in the beginning of October."",
  ""And then cash flow from investing activities, that's mainly investments in development costs."",
  ""The item from financial activities was very small for the quarter, and then we had a negative exchange rate difference in cash amounting to SEK 7 million."",
  ""That meant that we ended the quarter with SEK 666 million on our bank balances."",
  ""And with that, we conclude this part of the presentation, and I think we can open up for questions.""
]","[
  ""And  for taking my questions."",
  ""A few of them on my end."",
  ""And I'll start off with, you mentioned in the report healthy order intake for the Educational segment."",
  ""And since you don't disclose orders, can you talk a little bit more what this actually entails?"",
  ""And in addition, based on the current tender activity out there, are you able to provide us with some kind of direction on the average selling price in Edu since what we have seen over the last few years, or at least the last few quarters is an average selling price for Edu modules coming down."",
  ""So, just based on the tenders and the specification of these, in what direction is this moving?"",
  ""That would be my first question."",
  ""And potentially – but if you could give us some kind of flavor here, and because that was kind of my point where I was getting at, that we saw an average selling price coming down last year due to sort of the budget restrictions that's out there."",
  ""And if you're in current tender, are seeing a shift in activity to be more willing to buy more advanced simulators or with a more advanced software package... Versus... Okay, great."",
  ""And if I were to turn to OEM and what we have seen here in the last few quarters and I asked the same question in Q2, I note very sort of strong sales in OEM simulator hardware."",
  ""And I would guess that would indicate very sort of strong demand and continued demand outside of robotics."",
  ""And again, same question, I think, Q2, is have you reached some type of inflection point when addressing the sort of OEM non-robotic customers and have their behavior changed or anything?"",
  ""And potentially just a follow-up on that, it's kind of back to the original question, is it your focus on these customers or is there a change in customer adopting simulation to these products or it's a combination of both?"",
  ""And as well a question on the OEM."",
  ""And you mentioned this ultraportable light-weight simulator, what is this?"",
  ""And since you mentioned different countries, perhaps I can end with a one last question."",
  ""Which countries are sort of best in terms of payment cycles and then which ones are on the sort of worse end?"",
  ""That was all questions on my end and I'll get back into the queue."",
  ""So for Educational, in the full year, no real surprise that you won't grow for 2024 over 2023, but is the only swing factor the large tender you've previously mentioned or are there other factors in play as well?"",
  ""Just trying to triangulate the size of it, the largest orders that we do now about is the $7 million order received two years ago."",
  ""I would assume this is lower than that."",
  ""So anything you could help on the magnitude of this and the swing factors in terms of Edu growth this year?"",
  ""And on the R&D side in your CEO letter and talking about some challenges on getting the organization in place to be able to deliver."",
  ""And it seems like a nice problem to have, but what do you need to in order sort of get it all right according to plan?"",
  ""Is it a worry for you or just business as usual, to get all of this in place?"",
  ""And a follow-up on that one, given your experience in other companies, is this something which you think you want to change the way the company has been working, tweaking it or is this in line with previous modes of operation?"",
  ""Just thinking about the flavor you're adding now and that you're still looking...?"",
  ""Is that major work yet to be done?"",
  ""Would have assumed that it has been reached or done already, given that Simbionix was acquired two years ago now, so I would assume it's just final tweaks on it or?"",
  ""Final question from me and it might be an external question, not up to you."",
  ""But with the tariffs that might put into play – be put into place for exports into the US, have you put any thoughts into any scenarios on this, given that the US is a large market."",
  ""You're selling and shipping a lot of products into it?"",
  ""Any thoughts on that one or is it too early maybe?"",
  ""And are those sites able to scale up if need would be?"",
  ""Would you be willing to or is it possible to expand those production sites in the US to source locally basically, if that would be a requirement?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""You've already discussed a little bit in terms of when it comes to the, like, being able to handle higher volumes, and that's going to be achieved through both new hiring but also increased efficiency."",
  ""Can you specify a little bit more, do you expect to make new hires selectively in certain areas?"",
  ""Or can we expect a quite market increase in employees and corresponding costs, so to speak?"",
  ""And you already mentioned that obviously that Educational Products is unlikely to grow this year."",
  ""But just in general, can we expect like a more normal pattern this year in terms of Q4 being the best quarter sales-wise or is that too early to say?"",
  ""And then to round off, I mean, it's obviously been discussed before, but when it comes to capital allocation, are you going to be pretty internally focused in terms of investing in the organization, developing the organization in the coming year?"",
  ""Or are you planning to use the cash pile of around SEK 660, SEK 670 million, for example, additional M&A?"",
  ""That was all from my side."",
  ""Hi, Ulrik, and  for the question."",
  ""I can start with the first part of the question which relates to the traction that we see, generally speaking, in the market."",
  ""And what we saw in a year ago was that the market started contracting, and due to both budget issues and also general inflation, it got harder for our customers to procure simulation products, broadly speaking, globally."",
  ""And this then has resulted in the negative trend that we've seen for Educational Products until the turnaround came last quarter."",
  ""So, the pipelines that we had and the opportunities that we had during this period did not like just go away."",
  ""There were still – the POs were still out there."",
  ""It was just that they didn't turn into sales."",
  ""And what we see now when the money comes flowing back into the systems, also globally speaking then, but in different paces, is that these tenders, they are then reactivated and they are then turned into orders."",
  ""And we saw some of that in quarter two and we saw an even stronger development in quarter three."",
  ""And I would say that that has been the main reason for the slow activity and declining sales in Educational Products."",
  ""It's not we feel – we estimate that we lose market share to competitors that deals completely vanish, but rather they have been put in, in the freezer and now they're coming back."",
  ""So, this means then that everything that we have worked on up until now and in terms of sales activity, we think that a lot of that can translate into sales."",
  ""I think that the medical device part of the industry, OEM business is an absolutely fantastic opportunity for us to continue to see growth and some things that we perhaps don't speak enough about here in these calls."",
  ""We tend to focus a lot on the surgical robotics side of the business."",
  ""And you can definitely say that we have seen a very strong increase from relatively low numbers it should be noted."",
  ""182% is great, but it comes from a low base."",
  ""But what I said in the beginning holds true, meaning that we see that simulators are used within the med device companies in a much broader – wider number of functions."",
  ""So before that might have been used primarily for education of surgeons of the new equipment."",
  ""But now we also see that the simulators are being used in R&D activities and also sales and marketing tools for the med device companies' sales force and marketing functions."",
  ""So they're used much more broader, and in that, they're also becoming a more critical tool for these med device companies."",
  ""And if you go into any typical large med device company such as Medtronic or Boston Scientific, they do conduct a lot of product launches every year with different types of medical devices that need training towards both sales and marketing people, but also, of course, towards surgeons who are going to use the tools."",
  ""And there we see a very strong potential to continue to grow the simulator sales across a wide range of companies and across a wide range of different application fields."",
  ""Does that answer your question?"",
  ""I think it's a combination."",
  ""It's a combination of the both."",
  ""This has been a clear and outspoken strategy for us to get deeper into these customers."",
  ""And by doing so, we also communicate the value much more strongly to them."",
  ""And then in turn, that drives the user uptake on their part."",
  ""So, the total addressable market here is very big."",
  ""And that's something that we then start to Yeah."",
  ""So if you take, for example, the sales and marketing teams, there are customers who are going to use simulation as a tool to either sell and market the med device companies' products, right."",
  ""They usually do so at the customer location, that could be in a hospital or it could be at a conference or a trade show, right."",
  ""And then the need to have an ultraportable device that is still extremely realistic in the experience when you run the simulator, is very big for our customers."",
  ""So having everything ultraportable in a suitcase that you can demo and show to your potential customers means a lot for them."",
  ""And we see this trend also in the surgical robotics field where the robotics manufacturers want to show off simulation and the robotics experience outside of the console itself, right."",
  ""So, historically, we have primarily sold software licenses to the surgical robotics companies that are then used on the console."",
  ""But we see an increased demand and interest also for surgical robotics companies to sell simulators with the simulation on top that are more ultraportable and outside of the console."",
  ""I can say that – Hi, Viktor by the way, sorry."",
  ""I can say that the swing factor is definitely large order."",
  ""But it's definitely not only that."",
  ""In general, we see a strong recovery in the other business across the board in all countries."",
  ""We operate in many countries with many different budgetary systems and different economical situations."",
  ""And we have a quite large pipeline, right."",
  ""And it's difficult for us to predict exactly how these tenders will come back and how fast the recovery will be country-by-country and then try to extrapolate that into some sort of global development."",
  ""And then it's also a moving target, right."",
  ""So I would say that that's the main factor."",
  ""And Gisli said – used the quote, it's a race against the clock."",
  ""We saw recovery from quarter two to quarter three."",
  ""And we have good hopes for continued growth in the Educational Products segment."",
  ""So that's how I would like to describe it."",
  ""It's a very good question."",
  ""And then you could be like alarmed is there a challenge."",
  ""There is always challenges at companies, right, especially companies that are growing in the pace that we are."",
  ""And I also feel – to start off with, I feel very confident that the global team there fantastically is passionate, engaged and very competent and experienced team that we have, will be able to address these challenges."",
  ""And more specifically than on the R&D challenges, the challenges they pertain to our ability to scale our capacity in R&D to handle both customer requests and customer projects that come in, broadly speaking, in both business areas throughout the business."",
  ""And there is a lot of things that we need to do in order to increase this capacity."",
  ""And some of them are, of course, hiring more people and onboarding them in an efficient and successful manner."",
  ""But it's also the ways of working the tools we use, the platforms we write code on and so on, where we can improve."",
  ""And of course, that will also then contribute to increased capacity."",
  ""So, it's definitely a very high focus area for us right now, and it will be for the coming year and years."",
  ""No, I think that, first of all, I inherit here the CEO position of a company that has been tremendously successful with the previous team and then previous – with the team and previous leadership of Gisli, which is a fantastic position to be in."",
  ""And we look at how are we going to address specifically this question and which I understand that you're asking about is that, I think that, that we real good solid developers in all the different offices that we have in Surgical Science and they're working in a very efficient and professional manner."",
  ""I do think that we have some challenges which comes through the integration of the different platforms that we have from the different companies that we have acquired."",
  ""If you know, Simbionix, SenseGraphics and Mimic, and they all come with different technical platforms into Surgical Science."",
  ""So there, we have a specific challenge to how to get that kind of entire code base into one uniform one and then get aligned ways of working around that."",
  ""So that's a specific challenge that we have due to the M&As that we have done."",
  ""This is the work that has started way back and is continuing."",
  ""I think that the necessity for improvement in this area has largely to do with the fact that we see so much uptick in customer activity and much many higher inbound requests coming into us."",
  ""So it becomes a more acute matter then."",
  ""But I think we're doing great progress and I'm very confident in the team's ability to handle this challenge."",
  ""We commented earlier on that we had an increased R&D spend for the quarter compared to the previous quarter, right."",
  ""And this is a long-term investment for us in order to cope with the increased demand."",
  ""We invest that money to all the different sites."",
  ""So we grow all the sites with head count and we see that we will do so also for the foreseeable future."",
  ""So, we are investing and we don't make any specific plans due to tariffs, because of, you know, to change those investments around."",
  ""We actually think that it's quite good to have a distributor developer network across our offices."",
  ""And  for the question."",
  ""So first of all, regarding the investments that we do in people, we will do them quite broadly across the different offices, as I just said, in R&D. And then when it comes to our ability to handle increased capacities, very important to have a focus on, what I call, operational scalability, which means that you increase the output with the same resources in place."",
  ""And this is how we also are going to achieve our profitability targets long term."",
  ""And the way you do that is that you become more efficient, and this does not, of course only go for R&D, but it goes for all the different functions that we have."",
  ""And the way you get more efficient in R&D is through the use of the similar code base, is the fact that you work on one code and then you can branch out rather than have different code basis for the different customers that we have."",
  ""That means that we can turn a customer request over to a delivery of a final product, software product in a shorter time period."",
  ""And also that all the customers can benefit from the different innovations that we do in the code, in the functions that we deliver, since they're part of the common branch, so to say."",
  ""And then there's also other things like languages, ways of working and processes and automation tools and so on that we can work on."",
  ""So there, it's like a very big array of different activities that all will drive capacity increases and our ability to serve our increasing customer base."",
  ""We have said repeatedly that we will have a very strong organic growth agenda and ambition."",
  ""And we also look at continuously inorganic opportunities."",
  ""We have done consolidation of the market already and we will continue to explore those options."",
  ""So, you should consider us to be able to allocate those funds both into growing the business organically as well as inorganically."",
  ""It's definitely on the plan of not just the R&D teams, but broadly in the company to employ AI more in the business, both primarily as a productivity enhancing tool."",
  ""Any more questions before we round off?"",
  ""And have a great day."",
  ""And then, I can continue a bit on your question on the average selling price."",
  ""When we sell our simulators, it's of course, the hardware."",
  ""And then we have a basic software package that is sort of included in that."",
  ""And then on top, we sell – we have like a library of different modules, more advanced procedures that you purchase."",
  ""And, of course, the more software we sell on each hardware platform, the better it is also for the margin."",
  ""What we saw last year when the market started to contract is that the hospitals were hit by inflation and the budgets were set before that."",
  ""So they didn't have enough money."",
  ""They still – the demand was still there and they wanted to purchase."",
  ""But what happened in the beginning was that they then purchased the hardware platforms with less software."",
  ""And that meant, of course, that our gross margin was affected by that."",
  ""So it's important for us to sell."",
  ""Of course, we can also upsell and we do that."",
  ""We have sales that are pure software on the existing hardware platforms."",
  ""And I would say that the product mix here is more important for our gross margin, because we have a broad range of products."",
  ""Some of them are not that large."",
  ""We have them because, it's important for us to have a full range, so that we can supply for a full large tender."",
  ""We see that we have a very high win rate for the large tenders."",
  ""So, that is important for us."",
  ""But, of course, with lower volumes, some of these products might not be sold that much separately."",
  ""And with lower volumes, the margin on them is less, generally speaking."",
  ""I hope that answers your question."",
  ""Yeah, no, definitely, I should say that."",
  ""Then sometimes, of course, since, you know, the large tenders are – there is a long lead time."",
  ""So often, the prices and everything are set."",
  ""There is a lag in the system due to that, the lead times."",
  ""But just generally speaking, yes, that's correct."",
  ""I mean, we should have good cash conversion, then I think that we've had very, very good."",
  ""And as I said, we had a big effect from the fact we could work a lot with the AR stock that we received when we acquired Simbionix."",
  ""But then we continued to work on that."",
  ""And what I can say is we have a healthy – that's something we – AR stock is something we follow closely."",
  ""And of course, sometimes depending on who you sell to, if it's the larger industry companies, for example, it might be that you have a bit longer payment terms, et cetera."",
  ""But it's also one day that you measure this."",
  ""It's on the 30th of September, right?"",
  ""So, timing is sometimes a bit difficult and might affect the number that specific day."",
  ""I'm not worried about our accounts receivables stock."",
  ""But it's something you constantly have to work with for sure."",
  ""But, as I said, we don't see any cause for concern or any general sort of shifting in trend or what have you."",
  ""But it can also be, of course, different between different countries, I must say."",
  ""In some countries, it might be that it takes a longer time to – we have distributors in most countries outside of the US, and sometimes it takes longer for them to, even though we have general payment terms towards them, et cetera."",
  ""And so, I will not pick or choose specific countries."",
  ""But the important thing for us is that we feel that we have a healthy AR stock."",
  ""And we also said before that we have such a strong cash position."",
  ""So if we need to use it somehow to – then we might do that also for shorter period of time to give people maybe a longer payment term or the large med device companies or what have you."",
  ""It's early of course, and one initial thought is probably that it – or initially it looks like it might be on products, not on services or like licenses."",
  ""As you know, our products are primarily shipped from Israel, where it might not be the case."",
  ""So, we don't see any – again, it being early, but we don't at all see any cause for alarm or concern regarding this for us."",
  ""And then, as you know, we have a smaller production unit in the US and we also have teams working on our software projects in the US."",
  ""We never give out short-term forecast."",
  ""We have our long-term financial goals."",
  ""And then this year, we talked more maybe of the short-term because we had the Q1 that we had, et cetera."",
  ""And yes, Q4 is usually the strongest and last year it was not."",
  ""And that was actually the first time many of us experienced that."",
  ""So, I mean, Q4 should be a strong quarter, but we cannot give any specific comments on this one."",
  ""Usually the orders – I mean, as we said last year also, it's important to remember and usually the orders come pretty late."",
  ""And Q4 last year we still had all these discussions."",
  ""There was no sort of reduction in demand and no change in competition or anything like that."",
  ""So that is important to remember that it was due to the fact that the hospitals simply did not have the funds left in their budgets when they came to Q4."",
  ""So let's see if we have some written questions here."",
  ""There is a question, if we will release information if when we win the big European tender?"",
  ""We have not said where the tender is."",
  ""So we said it's a big tender that we talked about in Q2."",
  ""Usually we don't – we have large order, we have orders of different sizes."",
  ""So usually we don't go out with separate press releases unless it's like the US order that we had in 2022, which was more a press release, because it was so big."",
  ""But, yes, we will of course follow-up and give out information on this one since we mentioned it."",
  ""Then we also have someone asking about if we could use our cash to buy Bitcoin?"",
  ""No, we think we can have better use of our funds as we just talked about in the plans that we have."",
  ""And then on the dV5, there are some questions."",
  ""If it's launched mid-2025, when do they usually buy licenses?"",
  ""The way it is today is that the customer usually – today it's sold There's also a question if we should expect a large one-off jump in license revenues?"",
  ""We have been asked that before."",
  ""Coming back to what Tom said that we are working with Intuitive towards the timeline."",
  ""There is no simulation on the dV5s right now, and a lot of things will be added going forward then when they do the actual commercial launch."",
  ""Then we also have a question on AI and AI tools... ...for our software development."",
  ""And then there's also a question about buyback of shares."",
  ""And that is correct that on First North Growth Market, we're not able or allowed to do this type of – we cannot purchase our own shares."",
  ""For that, you have to be on the main market."",
  ""First North Growth Market I think that concludes also the written questions."",
  "" for all the questions.""

82,3123985,061ZWS-E,2024-11-28,"[
  ""Welcome to the quarter three 2024 ."",
  ""Quarter three has been a busy quarter for the group."",
  ""I think we saw some activities in Bangladesh, for example, with the social unrest as well as the internet shutdown, and then we've seen some softness in the markets specifically Indonesia."",
  ""But, in general, from an overall performance standpoint, we are quite positive with the outcome."",
  ""And that's coming essentially on the back of strong OpEx, CapEx discipline across the group and also our ability to manage the balance sheet."",
  ""Our leverage for the quarter is down to 2.59x net debt to EBITDA, from 3.36x which was at the beginning of the year."",
  ""And that's coming both from the pay-down of some of the debt at the group level as well as the improved EBITDA performance for the year so far."",
  ""As you'll recall, in last year's investor conference, we did talk about our 5-by-5 strategy, and that was really focused on the five portfolio vectors as well as the five key strategic priorities."",
  ""Some of them are falling in place."",
  ""Our merger, which was announced in June, between Dialog and Airtel I think has been executed by the Sri Lankan team in a very positive manner."",
  ""I think we are getting the integration ahead of what was originally planned."",
  ""The delayering exercise, which was essentially creating Link Net as a FibreCo and moving the customers into XL to provide fixed mobile converged offer, has been done."",
  ""Now, Link Net is pretty much among the second largest platform for fiber wholesale provision, and XL continues to provide the fixed mobile converged offer."",
  ""We are also progressing well on the Indonesian mobile consolidation."",
  ""We're in the midst of negotiations as we're preparing the definitive agreements, but nothing is certain, and in due course of time when we complete, we would be announcing the outcome."",
  ""As I said, the OpEx and CapEx discipline is actually driving strong EBIT growth for us."",
  ""Quarter three and year-to-date, we've seen a 37.7% improvement on earnings before interest and tax."",
  ""As you recall, EBIT has been one of the KPIs we've been tracking for the year."",
  ""If I go to the next slide, just quick summary of our performance across all the – one second, yeah, I think – all the – the overall summary and then I'll cover a little bit around all the OpCos before I hand over to Nik to go into detail."",
  ""Year-to-date, PATAMI grew by – hit at MYR 1.1 billion, coming out of strong operational performance as well as the gains coming from forex."",
  ""As you know, at the end of September, ringgit was quite strong and that helped in terms of the forex gains coming for us."",
  ""We also had the buyback of bonds under the EMTN 30-year bond carried out, which did give us ability to pay down some debt as well as some gain coming out of the opportunity which we could monetize."",
  ""And of course, shares of the results from associates also gave us the advantage."",
  ""On underlying basis, I think the profits have been fairly strong at MYR 551 million, which is around 3.6x of what it was same period last year, coming out of, of course, growth, but as I said earlier, out of coming from the well management of OpEx and CapEx during the year, and that basically translates into strong profit numbers of MYR 551 million on a normalized basis."",
  ""And that excludes the impact of forex as well as the EMTN bonds redemption which we did."",
  ""EBITDA as well as CapEx control did give us a very strong cash flows of nearly MYR 2 billion."",
  ""This is adjusted operating free cash flow, which is basically after leases – ROU on leases."",
  ""And the impact excludes the dividend, which we received from – of MYR 408 million from CelcomDigi during the three quarters."",
  ""So, very strong cash flows, very strong profit performance, and that all resulting in a strong balance sheet at 2.59x net debt to EBITDA, which is fairly comfortable."",
  ""And overall liquidity has been very strong, not only at the group level, but also at the operating company level."",
  ""As we guided earlier in the year, and we did talk about that in the previous quarter, we maintained the position of revenue in line with the KPIs; EBIT growth ahead of KPIs."",
  ""Having said that, I think the headwinds on some of the markets specifically driven from macro environment, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, still remains, and we are conscious of those facts."",
  ""CapEx, we guided earlier, MYR 6.1 billion, I think we would be below that guidance for the full year."",
  ""So, let's go through individual OpCo."",
  ""I think, CDB, you would have seen the results of CelcomDigi."",
  ""I think dividend has been in line with our expectations."",
  ""Synergies are pretty much on target and then coming out of savings as well as increased productivity."",
  ""Having said that, the market competition remains quite intense in Malaysia."",
  ""XL, last quarter was softer coming out of heightened competition in the market."",
  ""We've also seen ARPU improvement there, but last quarter was a little bit of a dip in the ARPUs coming out of the increased competition."",
  ""Having said that, I think the company continues to focus on driving cost saving, which is delivering EBITDA double-digit growth and EBIT double-digit growth, and PATAMI at Robi, I think the effect of social unrest, internet shutdown and floods did have a negative influence on the revenue for the quarter; however, on a year-to-date basis, they're still positive."",
  ""But their efforts around the optimization of CapEx, adjusting to the reality in the market as well as managing their OpEx well, continues to deliver a very strong profit development in three quarters of around BDT 4 billion, which is substantially higher than what was the profit delivered by Robi in the same period last year."",
  ""Dialog, as I said earlier, I think progressing well on the integration with Airtel."",
  ""And the revenue has been down basically coming from the decision to defocus on low-margin hubbing business, but a quarter-on-quarter growth in revenue which is I think positive development."",
  ""Company continues to focus on cost rescaling."",
  ""But EBIT impacted by higher D&A, partly because of the integration of the two companies, as well as the impact coming from relatively lower forex gain compared to last year, and recognition of deferred tax liability, also the fact that some of the – to keep the balance sheet in control, some of the debt, which was the dollar debt, has been moved to local debt, which is at a much higher cost of borrowing."",
  ""Smart continues to be a star performer with very strong delivery of profit and cash flows."",
  ""And this is coming on the back of strong ARPU development in the market and also the fact that the cost controls continue to be playing an important role in profit growth of nearly 20 – 30%."",
  ""Link Net I think is still settling down with the reorganization of the focus of Link Net as a FibreCo."",
  ""As I said earlier, the customers have all been transferred to XL, so which means Link Net is essentially a FibreCo, some enterprise business and some media business which is there, and it continues to build home passes for XL and also looking at other opportunities outside with other ISPs."",
  ""The impact also on profit with one-off taxes coming because of the gains."",
  ""While the gains are not reflected in P&L, but the gain has an impact on the tax liability which was accounted for in quarter three."",
  ""EDOTCO I think continues to focus on colocations Boost, I think launch of the bank in June, we're seeing a good development on the bank front with a strong customer uptake as well as the deposit book which has been built."",
  ""The growth on revenue has been strong."",
  ""However, costs are getting the up-front ADA, extremely strong performance with the two verticals, which is customer engagement as well as the eCommerce enablement are the two strong verticals delivering growth, coming at around 18.8% year-to-date revenue growth as well as strong recovery with profits greater than 100% at around MYR 36 million for year-to-date."",
  ""Overall, in summary, I think, up and down, but broadly speaking, while softer on the revenue front relative to the previous quarters, I think management of OpEx, CapEx as well as capital balance sheet has shown a very strong performance coming in in the quarter and year-to-date for us."",
  ""With that, I'll just hand over to Nik to take you through more details around the financial numbers here."",
  ""Just a quick update on the headline KPI, I think, which I covered earlier."",
  ""These were our KPI we think we will be in line with what we said for revenue, we will exceed on EBIT and CapEx will be below what we had indicated at the beginning of the year, which was MYR 6.1 billion."",
  ""One of the key corporate actions which we are undergoing, we've talked about the merger in Indonesia."",
  ""I think, as you can see, in May, we did sign the nonbinding memorandum of understanding to explore a final due diligence process as well as negotiation of a definitive agreement are underway."",
  ""As I said earlier, there's nothing certain there, but progressing in the right direction."",
  ""Delayering of Indonesia, we did that, as I said earlier, that customers were transferred post approval of the regulator end of September, and these customers are now being provided converged offer in XL, and Link Net is now focusing on being a FibreCo."",
  ""Our consolidation in Sri Lanka underway."",
  ""Our implementation of the integration is ahead of what was originally scheduled, and that should result in us getting the synergies ahead of what was originally communicated."",
  ""EDOTCO, exit from Myanmar is still pending regulatory approval."",
  ""We understand it's now at the final stages."",
  ""However, given the uncertainties, we can't talk about how long will it take to get this regulatory approval."",
  ""Risks, I think Bangladesh is still trying to settle down from the new regime coming in place."",
  ""I think the initial discussions have been positive."",
  ""I think the new government is looking at significant reforms, which should have positive long-term impact."",
  ""But given the macro situation, we are seeing some pressures on affordability and buying power of the people in that country."",
  ""Fiber in Indonesia, while Link Net looks like a good opportunity, but would require funding."",
  ""I think that's something which we would not be putting that."",
  ""I think we would probably look at external funding to support that."",
  ""Volatility, competitive landscape in Indonesia and Malaysia, I think they remain quite intense after – at least in Indonesia, we saw a very strong path to ARPU enhancement over the last five, six quarters, but last quarters was little bit dampening and I think that continues."",
  ""Having said that, I think there is realization of improving the pricing in Indonesia."",
  ""Malaysia is a little bit still far from that."",
  ""I think, opportunities, USD, lower interest rates should, as I said earlier, help us while with the dollar debt, So, just kind of information that you would have heard, we've postponed the Investor-Analyst Day from 3rd December to 13th January."",
  ""I think we realize that doing it at the end of the year is not that constructive because we are internally with our board and with our major stakeholders, we are still in the process of finalizing With that, I'll hand over back to Clare."",
  ""My name is Clare Chin, Head of Investor Relations at Axiata Group Berhad."",
  "" for standing by, and welcome to Axiata's Third Quarter Results Briefing."",
  ""Today, we have present with us Vivek Sood, Group CEO; as well as Nik Rizal Kamil, our Group CFO; as well as representatives from our operating companies."",
  ""There will be a short presentation followed by a Q&A session."",
  ""Without further ado, I would like to hand over the conference to Vivek."",
  ""I will go through the next few slides on the results."",
  ""Firstly, on this slide is our reported results for the nine months of 2024."",
  ""On a reported basis, on the top left, our revenue was up 3.3% on a year-to-date basis, due to strong contribution from all OpCos with the exception of Link Net, Dialog and Robi."",
  ""Although Robi was mainly due to forex translation on a local currency basis, they actually grew on a year-to-date basis."",
  ""On a quarter-on-quarter basis, our revenue declined by 7.5%, though, which is mainly due to the lower revenue in XL on the back of softer quarter-on-quarter momentum in Indonesia, and also, at Robi, due to the social unrest leading to the internet shutdown in the month of July and also the several incidences of major flooding that happened during the quarter."",
  ""On EBITDA and EBIT, we continue to see double-digit growth, largely contributed by strong performance from all OpCos with the exception of Link Net."",
  ""EBITDA grew on a year-to-date basis by 14.6% on the back of higher revenue and lower costs."",
  ""Whilst EBIT growth of 37.7% was despite higher depreciation arising from Link Net's transition to FibreCo and also the Dialog and Airtel merger."",
  ""On a quarter-on-quarter basis, EBITDA was lower by 6.7% and EBIT was lower by 13.8% due to the impact of lower revenues quarter-on-quarter despite lower costs and also depreciation figures."",
  ""On the PATAMI, reported PATAMI level showed significant improvements to MYR 1.1 billion for year-to-date 2024."",
  ""And this was largely driven by higher revenue, higher share of results from associates, higher finance income or gain from the early partial redemption of the EMTN papers amounting to approximately MYR 306 million; but also on a year-to-date 2024 basis, we had forex gains compared to forex losses for the same corresponding period last year."",
  ""So, year-to-date 2024, we recorded a gain of MYR 432 million compared to a loss for year-to-date 2023 of MYR 261 million."",
  ""On the next slide, which is on underlying performance, on a constant currency basis, year-to-date revenue grew by 3.4%, supported by growth from all OpCos except for Link Net and Dialog."",
  ""The key drivers there in XL grew by 6.3%, driven by increased data and digital services on the back of increased ARPU; EDOTCO grew 8.7%, primarily from Malaysia and Bangladesh."",
  ""On a quarter-on-quarter basis, though, revenue on a constant currency declined 3.4%, mainly due to XL, due to the softer industry momentum quarter-on-quarter and also in Robi due to the countrywide internet shutdown and floods."",
  ""Year-to-date EBIT reported a strong growth of 38.9% to MYR 2.6 billion on an underlying basis, mainly driven by XL, which grew by 22.1% from revenue growth and from higher ARPU and stable costs."",
  ""Robi grew 35.7% from higher revenue and reduction in operating costs."",
  ""On a quarter-on-quarter basis, though, EBIT was down 8.2%, mainly in XL and also in Smart, mainly due to revenue and higher operating costs, respectively."",
  ""On a year-to-date, PATAMI grew by more than 100% to MYR 551 million due to EDOTCO from revenue growth and also Smart from EBIT flow through, offset by higher depreciation and amortization and taxation."",
  ""On a quarter-on-quarter basis, UPATAMI grew by 18.4% to MYR 205 million, mainly from Dialog from flow through of revenue, which includes Airtel from quarter three 2024 and lower net finance costs, and also the EDOTCO which was lifted by lower depreciation charges."",
  ""On the next slide, adjusted OFCF."",
  ""Adjusted OFCF increased by more than 100% to MYR 1.94 billion, due mainly to the EBITDA increase of 14.6% or MYR 1.04 billion."",
  ""There was also CapEx optimization at OpCos, especially at XL, Robi and EDOTCO."",
  ""And there was also lower interest costs of MYR 220 million, mainly to the large – mainly – largely due to the onetime benefit from partial early redemption of the EMTN."",
  ""This was offset by higher taxation, though, due to the higher profits in XL and Robi, and also the one-off impact from the delayering exercise at Link Net in quarter three."",
  ""On an OpCos basis, as you can see, all OpCos other than Link Net made positive contributions to the AOFCF year-to-date movement."",
  ""In the next slide, on balance sheet, we continue to work on reducing our net debt to EBITDA level where we ended quarter three 2024 at 2.59 times compared to 3.36 times at the end of quarter four 2023."",
  ""This was on the back of a reduction in borrowings and leases as well as EBITDA growth of 14.6%."",
  ""The total borrowings as at quarter three 2024 stood at MYR 22.2 billion, which is a MYR 2.6 billion reduction from end 2023 figure."",
  ""The reduction was on the back of the partial early redemption of EMTN at HoldCo level, as well as benefits of a stronger ringgit Malaysia at the end of quarter three, which helped with the translation of the USD loan balances at the end of the quarter."",
  ""HoldCo cash, however, has gone down from MYR 1.3 billion at the end of last quarter, quarter two 2024, to MYR 434 million as at the end of quarter three, where the main use of the funds was to partially redeem the EMTN during the quarter, and also for the early repayment of the MCTL loan facility of approximately $50 million."",
  ""On the next slide, still on balance sheet, we continue to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility and have increased our fixed rate borrowings from 56% in quarter two to now 69% as at end of quarter three."",
  ""This is mainly at Axiata due to the early partial redemption of the EMTN, but also at Dialog."",
  ""There's also further positive impact from the strengthening of ringgit to the US dollar recently, where whilst this has happened towards the end of – throughout quarter three, the group continually looks at how we can reduce our forex volatility exposure on our net debt, and as at end of quarter three 2024, we have increased our hedged debt position to 44% as at end of quarter three in comparison to 35% at the end of the previous quarter, quarter two."",
  ""On our group debt, it has an average tenure of 6.4 years, whereby short-term debt maturity over the next two years is 19%, and for HoldCo, it's 12%."",
  ""With that, I've come to the end of my segment, and I'll pass it over back to Vivek.""
]","[
  ""Just two questions from me."",
  ""The first one is on the debt reduction side, right?"",
  ""So, noted that net debt to EBITDA is at the lowest, 2.59x, looking at year-to-date, it's down by 10% in terms of total debt."",
  ""Can you clarify how much is from repayment and how much is from the stronger ringgit?"",
  ""And then, next question, looking forward in fourth quarter, since USD has strengthened, does that mean that we will see then higher total debt going into fourth quarter?"",
  ""Second one, you made an announcement, it was picked up by the news that Dr. Hans will be leaving in January because he's joining the Sri Lanka – he's going to be an advisor to the Sri Lankan President."",
  ""And we know that currently he's basically looking at the telco business and all the CEOs sort of report to him."",
  ""Moving forward, how will the structure be for Axiata after he has left in terms of org structure, will there be changes, can you share with us what you're doing and how you're handling that?"",
  ""I'll jump back to the queue."",
  ""I'm again going to focus on the balance sheet, but more on the future."",
  ""With our monetization efforts and all that's going on, as you described in your slides and the presentation, could you help us understand with regards to the HoldCo debt and balance sheet, if we were to raise money or if we were to monetize any of these assets, would our focus be on returning cash to shareholders or would we be focused more on de-gearing the HoldCo, so to speak?"",
  ""If you could help us understand your preference in that."",
  ""And I suppose, as a follow-up to that, in the transactions that you are pursuing at this point in time, is the preference more for cash coming in or for, I suppose, the market to set new prices for your assets?"",
  ""Firstly, I wanted to find out what was the start-up cost for the digital bank in the third quarter?"",
  ""And how do you see this start-up loss trending over the coming quarters?"",
  ""Number two, a question for EDOTCO."",
  ""I see in terms of the numbers, there was an 18% revenue drop Q-on-Q. What was the reason for that?"",
  ""And then also, for the normalized PATAMI, there was a 5 times jump Q-on-Q to And then, thirdly, for Link Net, are we rethinking our plans on the fiber coverage rollouts?"",
  ""I mean, given the intense retail competition, do you see that there's a risk, right, that could trickle down to the wholesale market in terms of how much access seekers are willing to pay to lease the Link Net network?"",
  ""Those are my three questions."",
  ""I wanted to understand, in terms of the opportunity to lease more towers, right, to U Mobile now that they have won the rights to roll out the second 5G network, yeah, how many number of new leases do you think we can get from that rollout?"",
  ""But just based on how many towers we leased to U Mobile for 4G, right, assuming they roll out it based on the 4G grid, how many Okay."",
  ""Maybe just a quick follow-up, Vivek, on the MYR 45 million loss you mentioned for the digital bank, that was in the third quarter itself, is it?"",
  ""So, if I were to remove the digital bank loss, Boost would actually have been profitable for the third quarter?"",
  ""Just one question for me, please."",
  ""If I had to zoom into the third quarter result itself, the margin from the Robi and Dialog was very strong, and especially for Robi, I mean, considering the lower revenue, we still have a higher EBITDA with unrest and all those."",
  ""So, what's exactly happened in these two markets and how sustainable or not is this kind of cost structure or this kind of margin trend?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""So, I think – I actually have two questions which I think may have been touched on partially by the previous queries and answers."",
  ""So, I'm just looking for a more specific response to these two questions."",
  ""So, I'm going to ask; A, about Sri Lanka and Bangladesh."",
  ""It looks like your businesses in those countries are resilient despite the macroeconomic headwinds."",
  ""My question is on this note would be, considering the headwinds and your good performance, what is your outlook / strategy in terms of expectations of these two countries to contribute to your revenue, to the group's revenue and profitability and also your deployment of resources in terms of growing in these two countries?"",
  ""Is it more of you're happy to proceed as planned before the macroeconomic headwinds, or it has – what happened recently in the past few months sort of giving you a more of a sit-and-wait approach?"",
  ""And then, my second query is more to Indonesia, which is I know you've mentioned that there's been higher competition, and therefore lower margins and revenues."",
  ""So, Indonesia is a mass market, obviously."",
  ""If you give us a little bit more detail on your plan to sort of grow your revenue or sort of fight the market conditions to become a bigger player in that market, I would really appreciate your thoughts and views on that?"",
  ""So, those are my two questions."",
  ""That's the first question, and the second one is about Indonesia."",
  ""...  very much for that."",
  ""I think maybe just your views on Indonesia?"",
  ""If you'd like me to repeat my question, that's also... Yeah."",
  "" very much for your answers."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""I have two questions, Vivek."",
  ""Firstly, on the leverage side, leverage has come down this year."",
  ""But can you tell us your kind of one- to two-year target on where you want the leverage at the group level to come down and what kind of levers are there at the group level?"",
  ""Secondly, on Indonesia, I don't know if this was asked earlier, sorry, I joined the call late."",
  ""On the merger of XL and Sinar Mas, can you walk us through kind of the next steps and what are the time lines which you are looking at for the merger completion?"",
  ""Is there, like, a time line for both the parties on these definitive agreements, like... ...beyond which, you can – yeah?"",
  ""I think, Nik, you want to...  And then strong ringgit actually is negative on translation for us, right, on EBITDA?"",
  ""So, I guess... So, I guess now that it is – I think we closed at about So, you would see that impact coming back on the – because of the ringgit weakening in this quarter."",
  ""Let me take the third one."",
  ""Hans can also advise how to restructure the organization."",
  ""I think this is the most recent development."",
  ""So, I am in conversation with my board on how we should reorganize ourselves."",
  ""So, I think that we would hopefully be able to let all of you know when we meet in January."",
  ""So, I think let me maybe take, Prem, the first one."",
  ""I think we would – first objective would be to create a HoldCo debt and overall balance sheet which is long-term sustainable so that we can continue to generate steady dividend flow with progressive growth over a period of time."",
  ""So, I think that would be the objective."",
  ""I don't think we would look at onetime gratification or earnings for the shareholders because the objective always is being sustainable dividend, right?"",
  ""So, I think that would be the immediate priority for us."",
  ""And at this point in time, whatever effort we are making, including the buyback of some of the bonds in the last quarter, is all with the intention of reducing the dollar exposure at the group."",
  ""Because that's essentially a leakage, as you can see, from whatever we are able to earn from our operating companies."",
  ""So, it's better for us to pay that down."",
  ""So, that I think is going to be the philosophy we will follow to achieve a sustainable dividend yield as well as a progressive growth in the dividend."",
  ""Second question, I think the transaction is just starting with, of course, the ability to monetize, but some of these transactions are starting with the most sustainable business or the operating company opportunity, right?"",
  ""I mean, what we've done in Sri Lanka, what we are trying to do in Indonesia is basically looking at market consolidation to be three-player market, which should So, that's I think the starting point, which is there."",
  ""But to do that, we will also look at – and we'll do that for what is right for the operating company."",
  ""And to do that, if there are assets where we can also monetize by way of a secondary, we will do that."",
  ""And that helps us to pay down some of our leverage at the group level."",
  ""So let me just – the first one, Boost Bank, I think we've got MYR 45 million losses."",
  ""As you know, we just launched the bank in June."",
  ""So, I would expect around MYR 20 million to MYR 25 million per quarter kind of a run rate, which will be there, and that we expect to have over the next three years till we turn profitable on the bank, which is what was our original plan which we had laid out."",
  ""But I think the good thing is the bank would be fairly operational once we start transferring, which we've already started doing, the loan book, which sits in the Boost Holding Company, into the bank."",
  ""So, they will have a clear early start of getting revenue from the loan book, which already exists there."",
  ""So, that's we expect on the bank side."",
  ""EDOTCO, I think, maybe I can ask Clare or Nik to... Nik, if I can add on this... Yeah."",
  ""So, I think revenue I think if you recall, last year, there was a gain coming from the – one-off coming from the CD settlement."",
  ""As part of the settlement, we've accounted for certain discounts earlier and because of the settlement, that discount was no longer applicable."",
  ""Hence, there was a one-off reversal, right, of about – there was a reversal of MYR 121 million."",
  ""Of the MYR 121 million, MYR 46 million is actually recurring, right, annually, because that has been something that we have been providing for, yeah, over the last two, three years."",
  ""So, that's essentially coming from revenue."",
  "" But essentially, the quarter impact is around approximately MYR 50 million on EBIT."",
  ""So, that's one quarter impact."",
  ""And essentially, third quarter impact on PAT is around MYR 45 million."",
  ""And essentially, you – the other aspect that you see a big swing in PAT is also driven – Q-on-Q is also driven by the forex gain, yeah, essentially coming from the unrealized forex loss as well, right, and Q-on-Q impact on forex is essentially MYR 207 million gain."",
  ""Foong, on the 5G, can you just repeat what was your question?"",
  ""Well, very, very difficult to say at this point in time."",
  ""I don't know, Adlan, if you have an answer, because it will all depend on what... Yeah."",
  ""kind of grid the new network uses."",
  ""I think it's still too early I think, Foong, because I think U Mobile is probably doing their planning as well."",
  ""But essentially, for EDOTCO, yeah, two is better than one, and basically now we have the second 5G operator, that creates a new opportunity."",
  ""Our baseline has always been one."",
  ""With the second one, it creates just new opportunity for us."",
  ""I think that we'll know in due course."",
  ""Because, the thing is also the final letter is also not out yet as far as we understand, yeah, from the regulators to U Mobile."",
  ""Today, if you look at what are we leasing to U Mobile, today it's around 1,500."",
  ""Your fourth question on Link Net, I think our view is Link Net has already got the second largest home passes, right, which is basically what they served for themselves, which are now being served for XL, as well as the home passes which they've built for XL, for XL to serve, which is nearly around 3.4 million."",
  ""So, that in itself is – provides – and the old one is nearly 22% penetration."",
  ""So, that provides a sustainable cash flow for Link Net."",
  ""And then, there are opportunities where XL has partnered with Link Net to look at further growth, expansion plan."",
  ""So, I think from that perspective, Link Net is – from a liquidity, cash flows is fine."",
  ""The question is whether the market is going to get – start getting more saturated given the wholesale pricing, which is there, as with all pressures on wholesale pricing, as well as how much sale on the home connects happen."",
  ""On the ServeCo side, I think that we'll have to watch out."",
  ""There's always a euphoria when market opens up for certain things which are seen as a potential big opportunity, but as you know, not many survive in that kind of a situation."",
  ""And we've seen that in a lot of markets where fiber play suddenly starts expanding."",
  ""No, no, no, that's year-to-date."",
  ""But majority would have come in the third quarter because prior to that was just more operating expenses which were capitalized prelaunch, right?"",
  ""I think the MYR 45 million – I don't know exactly how much it would have been for third quarter."",
  ""But yeah, I mean, the losses from the others would be substantially lower."",
  ""And then, we look at 2025 probably exit when the nonbank business will be profitable."",
  ""So, maybe, Rajeev, you're on the call?"",
  ""Rajeev, you're on the call?"",
  ""Yes, Vivek, I'm on the call."",
  ""Maybe you can... Yeah. ..."",
  ""provide why the margin was stronger and are these sustainable?"",
  ""I think, as Vivek explained, in Q3, there was a period of social unrest."",
  ""For a period of time, our network was shut down, especially on the internet side."",
  ""So, the revenues suffered because of that."",
  ""At the same time, during this period, because of the situation and also the change in the taxation on the new SIM cards, the number of SIM cards which were selling in the market, that has reduced significantly."",
  ""So, there has been a significant cost saving on that side, which is one of the biggest elements of this improvement in margin."",
  ""And along with that, some of the marketing activities, given the market condition, we slowed down on them because they were not required given market was closed most of the time."",
  ""So, these were the two main reasons why margins improved."",
  ""Along with that, our sustained efforts to improve our operating efficiencies, that's a continuous journey."",
  ""So, if I speak about in future, margins will remain strong."",
  ""The SIM card sales is still suppressed given the market conditions."",
  ""So, in the future, if I look at Q4, margins should remain at a stronger level as compared to the first half of the year."",
  ""So, Dialog, Supun, you're on the call, right?"",
  ""So, Dialog, again, continued the price hardening exercise, which we started in second quarter."",
  ""So, third quarter, we had a larger period of higher pricing which we did, and as a result, we saw 8% quarter-on-quarter growth in mobile, which led to margin improvement."",
  ""In addition, the energy prices were lower with improvement in the economy, inflation coming down."",
  ""So, energy price reductions also helped, plus our continued efforts on cost reductions helped."",
  ""There was some dilution on the margins because of the negative EBITDA that we carried through from Airtel integration, close to about LKR 300 million or about $1 million."",
  ""This would continue to improve going forward."",
  ""So, overall, the margin improvement is sustainable, the revenue improvement is sustainable as we progress through the merger, integration and synergy realization, as Vivek explained."",
  ""So, you're looking at Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, right?"",
  ""So, fundamentally, both markets are strong."",
  ""Fundamentally, the market structure is fairly positive in these two markets."",
  ""The Sri Lanka is pretty much two-and-a-half player market, and there is – we've seen that, which is what Supun said, there is this ability to increase prices, go for price hardening."",
  ""So, I think, fundamentally, this market is strong."",
  ""Secondly, I think the Bangladesh, again, from a market structure standpoint, fairly strong."",
  ""I think Robi is a strong second player, going very well on the margins as well as profit line."",
  ""Having said that, I think the impact of the recent development in Bangladesh haven't still settled down."",
  ""So, I think what Rajeev what said, the wait-and-watch would continue for some time where, for example, the SIM sale, ensuring that there is no major marketing spend or CapEx being moderated over time, look at US dollar pay-down, risk on the balance sheet being – I think that's something will remain a focus as till such time the market gets some form of stability or the macro environment gets some form of stability."",
  ""So, Bangladesh, I would still say is a little bit of wait-and-watch and see how all the developments happen on both the economic and political front there."",
  ""No, no, no, it's fine."",
  ""I heard... We heard your question."",
  ""I think, Indonesia, there's an obvious realization that the current pricing levels are not sustainable for the market."",
  ""In our view, as an investor, there's been a kneejerk reaction by the operators post the merger of one of the companies there."",
  ""And that kneejerk reaction has seen softening of the market."",
  ""But that may not be the long-term view we carry because there's been smooth run for a period of time where we saw ARPU improvement, market stabilization, and this whole issue of market pricing being brought down hasn't helped any of the operators from their margins and profitability standpoint."",
  ""To me, this softening I guess is an interim phase."",
  ""Things should start moving up."",
  ""We're seeing some improvement there in this quarter."",
  ""But going forward, in 2025, we are more optimistic that the market will still be positive."",
  ""Having said that, I think the macro challenges of the mass market affordability will remain somewhat a headwind in Indonesia."",
  ""So, first of all,  very much for joining... There's one more, okay."",
  ""The first one, I think we did say, Piyush, earlier that we want to be 2.5x net debt to EBITDA by 2026."",
  ""At the moment, we are ahead."",
  ""Part of it, as was explained earlier, also comes because of the strengthening of ringgit."",
  ""We expect that strengthening should continue in future, where I guess we would be ahead on that."",
  ""To us, 2.5x is a sustainable balance sheet leverage level for us."",
  ""More important for us is to pay down some of the leverage at the group level, and that's where some of the monetization of the assets, we look at it."",
  ""So, fundamentally, I guess, two levers."",
  ""One, we expect continued growth on EBITDA across our operating companies, which has been visible this year, and we expect that to continue."",
  ""Second one is some of the monetization activities, which we are doing, should be used or will be used pretty much to pay down the holding company debt."",
  ""So, that I think is the plan."",
  ""The second one was the merger, which I said earlier that the discussions, due diligence has been fairly completed."",
  ""We are now in the stages of agreeing the definitive agreement, negotiations around that going on."",
  ""The process in Indonesia requires the approvals from the local board, local – so, all that things have been now kind of worked on."",
  ""As I said, there's nothing certain, but we are progressing in the right direction."",
  ""There is a long stop, which is March next year."",
  ""But I think – but that's – that's the long stop."",
  ""I mean, we... I mean, that's – if things are working well, then you can still extend it mutually, right?"",
  ""But that's what is the plan."",
  ""... Well, difficult to commit."",
  ""I think we see positive development on FCF."",
  ""I think we'll probably make a decision after the full year is over."",
  ""But, we will – we, as I said – we said earlier, we're still committed to MYR 0.10 and then to progressively increase."",
  ""So, I guess what my last comments would be that we did see some softening in some of the markets on the top line, some markets did pick up well."",
  ""I think we have a combination of assets, good news, bad news, you can say whatever, but there's always one positive than the other negative or things change."",
  ""But, overall, I think fundamental focus of the entire organization on operational excellence, managing costs well, adjusting CapEx in line with how the market developments are happening, I think those things are being really focused on balance sheet, managing liquidity has been the cornerstone of how the operating companies have been working and focusing on."",
  ""So, that part is I think something which we've been able to do well over the last couple of years."",
  ""Market situation is something which we will work on ensuring the market conduct, et cetera, improves, and that we should see an upside."",
  ""Having said that, I think from a strategic standpoint, we would like you to be participating on the Investor Day on the 13th of January, where we will have more discussions around what's the future next step for Axiata."",
  "" very much, and have a good day."",
  ""So, we will move on to the Q&A session."",
  ""To ask your questions, you may choose to do this verbally, just raise your hand and wait till your name is called up for your turn."",
  ""Otherwise, you can also type your question in the chat box, too."",
  ""So, I do see two hands raised."",
  ""First, let's go with Izzati from Macquarie."",
  ""I think, essentially, the repayment that was done in the year was a MYR 1.2 billion and approximately – that does accounts actually for about 20% of the net debt to EBITDA move – sorry, the debt movement from end of last year to this quarter."",
  ""So, essentially, 80% of the movement was due to the ringgit strengthening that has somewhat delivered the stronger or at least lower net debt to EBITDA ratio."",
  ""But having said that, it is a ratio."",
  ""You will also recall that we mentioned just now that EBITDA also delivered strong growth of close to 15% on a YTD basis."",
  ""Only on the taka as well as the IDR... Yeah."",
  ""I think next up we have Prem."",
  ""So, moving along then, I think next up we have Foong from CIMB."",
  ""So, on EDOTCO, the reason for the big quarter-on-quarter jump is mainly due to the revision of useful life of their tower assets that came about in quarter three."",
  ""So, the main impact is actually due to the revision of useful life from 15 to 30 years."",
  ""Adlan is on the line."",
  ""Perhaps to clarify that, I think you would see that on a YTD basis, Boost losses was MYR 134 million."",
  ""So, out of that, MYR 45 million is coming through from the bank's side."",
  ""So, to answer your question, Foong, the rest of the business is still loss-making, albeit on a narrowing basis."",
  ""Moving on, we have Isaac, Isaac from Affin."",
  ""So, moving on, next in the queue is Xian Wei from HSBC."",
  ""Xian Wei, please go ahead."",
  ""It looks like we do not have further questions."",
  ""I don't see any questions on the chat box either."",
  ""So, perhaps then maybe we proceed with closing remarks, Vivek?"",
  ""Sorry, Vivek, sorry to interrupt."",
  ""There is Piyush from HSBC."",
  ""One last question I see in the chat box now."",
  ""Just – with stronger cash flow generation, do you see higher dividend payout exceeding committed MYR 0.10?"",
  ""So, I think that's all the questions we have for today.""

83,3117914,00D5X1-E,2024-11-21,"[
  ""I would like to start by reviewing the Fund's activities over the last quarter."",
  ""We maintained our monthly dividend at $0.105 per share or 15.2% annualized based on the share price as of November 19, 2024, which is now declared through February of 2025."",
  ""The monthly dividend is supported by core net investment income of $0.45 per share and $0.70 of recurring cash flows during the quarter."",
  ""We completed a private placement of five-year, 7.125% convertible preferred shares due 2029."",
  ""Six months after issuance, the holders have the option to convert the preferred shares into common stock at the greater of NAV or the average closing price of the five previous trading days."",
  ""We issued 1.4 million of our common shares through a registered direct placement at a price above the Fund's NAV."",
  ""Total net proceeds from these two offerings were approximately $22.2 million."",
  ""These offerings are in addition to 6.8 million of common shares issued through the ATM program."",
  ""New CLO investments during the quarter totaled $39.6 million, with a weighted average GAAP yield of 16.5%."",
  ""The aggregate portfolio weighted average GAAP yield was 18.6% as of September 30."",
  ""Pivoting to the current market environment, I'd like to discuss what we've observed in both the loan and CLO equity markets over the quarter."",
  ""The CLO market continues to experience strong issuance activity, supported by tightening spreads and a stable backdrop for credit."",
  ""Third quarter CLO new issuance totaled $39 billion, representing a 42% increase year-over-year."",
  ""Refinancing and reset volumes totaled $21 billion and $72 billion in the third quarter."",
  ""CLO resets and refinancings are up 10 times year-over-year, mainly driven by the tightening of CLO liabilities, which allows deals to cut their borrowing costs."",
  ""Resets and refinancings have been largely absent from our market during 2022 and 2023, since financing spreads were at historical highs."",
  ""So there's an element of catch-up in our market today."",
  ""Within CCIF portfolio, we continue to work with CLO managers and have completed seven resets year-to-date through September, extending the reinvestment period and cash flows of these CLOs."",
  ""Despite the increase in CLO reset activity, 33% of the CLO market is still out of its reinvestment period."",
  ""The CCIF portfolio only has two positions outside the reinvestment period, both of which were opportunistic purchases."",
  ""In September, the Federal Reserve reacted to a more normalized inflation environment and a weaker labor market by cutting rates by 50 basis points, marking its first reduction in 2020."",
  ""CLO equity is modeled using a forward curve for base rates, so today's current yields take into account expectations for future rate cuts."",
  ""Cash-on-cash returns could decline slightly if rates move lower, though borrower health should improve due to lower interest expense, which should help the credit quality of the underlying portfolios."",
  ""US loan borrowers demonstrated strong performance throughout the quarter."",
  ""Interestingly, in court and out-of-court bankruptcies continued to diverge."",
  ""While the LSTA LTM default rate of 80 basis points remained less than half of its 20-year average, the default rate, inclusive of distressed exchanges, remains high at 3.7%."",
  ""We believe that out-of-court bankruptcies will continue to be the predominant form of default given the degradation of loan documentation."",
  ""That said, recoveries for out-of-court processes have thus far been higher than recoveries in Chapter 11."",
  ""The 600-plus borrowers in Carlyle's US loan portfolio have generally continued to focus on free cash flow generation."",
  ""We are still in the midst of third quarter earnings, but in the second quarter, borrower EBITDA growth of 9% outpaced revenue growth of 5%."",
  ""At this point, we're seeing similar trends in the third quarter."",
  ""Additionally, interest coverage increased quarter-over-quarter to 3.3 times and is approaching the historical average of 3.9 times."",
  ""Only 3% of borrowers had an interest coverage ratio of less than 1 time, suggesting that borrowers are navigating the higher interest rate environment well."",
  ""Third quarter institutional gross loan issuance increased 61% year-over-year as borrowers continued to manage their respective cost of debt through repricing activity."",
  ""On average, borrowers reduced spread by 50 basis points with each repricing, resulting in an overall spread decline of 20 basis points in the loan market."",
  ""This spread compression is in line with what we've seen in other fixed income markets."",
  ""While loan prices experienced a decline in August related to volatility in the broader market, they rebounded to remain in line quarter-over-quarter, with third quarter ending at 96.71%."",
  ""As we approach 2025, we remain constructive on the outlook for the broadly syndicated loan in CLO asset classes."",
  ""Key factors such as a resilient US economy, moderating inflation, and the normalization of monetary policy support an outlook for sales growth, EBITDA growth, and reduced interest expense for our borrowers."",
  ""I will now hand the call over to Nishil Mehta, our Portfolio Manager, to discuss our deployment and the current portfolio."",
  ""We continue to believe that CCIF is well-positioned to provide investors with an attractive dividend yield and total return."",
  ""In addition to incorporating our market and manager views, we remain focused on analyzing the underlying collateral in each CLO equity position that we own in order to deliver strong risk adjusted returns for our investors."",
  ""I'd now like to hand the call over to the operator to take your questions."",
  ""With me on the call today is Lauren Basmadjian, CCIF Chief Executive Officer; Nishil Mehta, CCIF Portfolio Manager; and Nelson Joseph, CCIF Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Last night, we issued our Q4 financial statements and a corresponding press release and earnings presentation discussing our results, which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website."",
  ""Following our remarks today, we will hold a question-and-answer session for analysts and institutional investors."",
  ""This call is being webcast and a replay will be available on our website."",
  ""Any forward-looking statements made today do not guarantee future performance and any undue reliance should not be placed on them."",
  ""These statements are based on current management expectations and involve inherent risks and uncertainties, including those identified in the Risk Factors section of our annual report on the Form N-CSR."",
  ""These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated."",
  ""Carlyle Credit Income Fund assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements at any time."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Lauren."",
  ""We continue to leverage Carlyle's longstanding presence in the CLO market as one of the world's largest CLO managers and a 15 year track record of investing in third-party CLOs to manage a diversified portfolio of CLO equity investments."",
  ""As of September 30, our portfolio comprised of 49 unique CLO investments managed by 27 different collateral managers."",
  ""We continued to source the majority of our investments in the secondary market and selectively invested in primary markets to take advantage of spread compression and supported CLO arbitrage."",
  ""We continue to target recent vintages of Tier 1 and Tier 2 managers with ample time remaining in the reinvestment period in the secondary market."",
  ""Given the sustained stability and low market fundamentals, we believe the CLO market will continue experience strong issuance."",
  ""We continue to leverage Carlyle's 14-step CLO investment process and the credit expertise of the Carlyle Liquid Credit team."",
  ""Today we have 23 US and 10 European credit research analysts to complete bottoms-up fundamental analysis on the underlying loan portfolios of CLOs."",
  ""As Lauren mentioned, the CLO equity market was impacted by the record repricing wave, which has reduced weighted average spread of CCIF's portfolio by 10 basis points over the quarter and 26 basis points year-to-date, causing CCIF's GAAP yield to decline."",
  ""The following represents some key stats on the portfolio as of September 30."",
  ""The portfolio generates a GAAP yield of 18.63% on a cost basis supported by cash-on-cash yields of 27.91% on CLO investment quarterly payments received during the quarter."",
  ""The weighted average years left in reinvestment period increased to approximately two-and-a-half years, providing CLO managers the opportunity to capitalize on periods of volatility to improve portfolios or reposition them."",
  ""We believe the weighted average junior overcollateralization cushion of 4.33% is a healthy cushion to offset default and losses in the underlying loan portfolios."",
  ""The weighted average spread of the underlying portfolios was 3.46%."",
  ""The percentage of loans rated CCC by S&P was 5.9%, below the 7.5% CCC limit in CLOs."",
  ""As a reminder, once a CLO has more than 7.5% of its portfolio rated CCC, the excess over 7.5% is marked at the lower of fair market value or rating agency recovery rates and reduces the overcollateralization cushion."",
  ""And the percentage of loans trading below $80 declined from 4.2% to 3.2%."",
  ""I will now turn over to Nelson, our CFO, to discuss the financial results."",
  ""Today, I will begin with a review of our fourth quarter earnings."",
  ""Total investment income for the fourth quarter was $7.9 million or $0.55 per share compared to $7.4 million or $0.58 per share in the prior quarter."",
  ""Total expenses for the quarter were $3.7 million compared to $3.4 million in the prior quarter."",
  ""Total net investment income for the fourth quarter was $4.2 million or $0.30 per share compared to $4 million or $0.32 per share in the prior quarter."",
  ""Core net investment income for the fourth quarter was $0.45 per share."",
  ""Core net investment income is recurring cash flows minus expenses and we believe a more accurate prediction of the Fund's future distribution requirements."",
  ""Net asset value, as of September 30, was $7.64 per share compared to $7.68 per share in the prior quarter."",
  ""Our net asset value and valuations are based on the bid size mark we receive from third-party on 100% of the CLO portfolio."",
  ""We continue to hold one legacy real estate asset in the portfolio."",
  ""The fair market value of the loan is $2.2 million."",
  ""The third-party we engaged to sell our position continues to work through the sales process."",
  ""During the fourth quarter, we sold 850,000 of our common shares in connection with the ATM offering program at a premium to NAV, net proceeds of $6.8 million."",
  ""Additionally, we issued 1.4 million common shares in a private placement offering."",
  ""The overall common share issuance for the quarter resulted in net accretion of our net asset value of $0.04 per share."",
  ""The cash-on-cash yields of 27.91% on CLO investment quarterly payments resulted in $0.70 recurring cash flow."",
  ""The quarterly cash payments received in October totaled $11 million or approximately $0.72 per share, compared to $4.5 million of dividends paid in the quarter or $0.315 per share."",
  ""On the topic of distributions, I now want to spend a few minutes talk about our 2024 full fiscal year distributions and related tax designation for our shareholders."",
  ""For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, the Fund had $15.6 million in distributions to shareholders, of which $15.2 million was designated as return on capital, primarily due to a one-time timing mismatch between when CLOs issued their tax reporting requirements and the Fund's fiscal year end."",
  ""According to our tax accounts, this is a common issue in the first year of a fund that invests in CLO equity."",
  ""The underlying CLO equity investment tax reporting statements, commonly referred to as PFIC statements, are reported annually and are typically received on an eight-month lag."",
  ""Per guidelines established by the IRS, taxable income for CCIF only includes taxable income for CLOs that issue the annual PFIC statements during CCIF's fiscal year."",
  ""For CCIF, this means the fund only includes taxable income from CLOs that issued their PFIC statements between October 1, 2023 and September 30, 2024."",
  ""For investments purchased by CCIF between January 1 and September 30, 2024, CCIF does not yet have any PFIC reporting available and therefore, we assume zero taxable income for these investments for fiscal year 2024 per IRS guidelines."",
  ""Taxable income for these investments will be incorporated into our fiscal year 2025 financial statement after we receive the PFIC statements in 2025."",
  ""As a result for the 2024 fiscal year, CCIF is only able to recognize taxable income for investments purchased in calendar year 2023."",
  ""This covers less than six-month period since Carlyle took over it as the investment advisor of the fund in July 2023."",
  ""Furthermore, the fund was ramping and initial cash available and the average hold period for CLO investments in calendar year 2023 was limited."",
  ""While the portion of our dividends paid in fiscal year 2024 will be recognized as return on capital, CCIF's core NII in fiscal year 2024 was $1.64, well in excess of $1.23 amount of distributions paid."",
  ""We believe core NII is a more accurate prediction of the Fund's distribution requirements."",
  ""Due to the nature of our underlying investments, the percentage of return on capital is likely to vary year-over-year."",
  ""With that, I'll turn it back to Lauren.""
]","[
  ""I want to start out by asking a high level question."",
  ""When you think about this year overall, the backdrop has been pretty constructive in terms of the loan market and underlying borrower performance, but CLO equity has been relatively weak."",
  ""And I want to understand, to what do you attribute the weakness in the CLO equity market valuations, which has caused you to report unrealized portfolio depreciation every quarter?"",
  ""And it looks like that continued into October."",
  ""So, Nishil, if I understand correctly and if I can paraphrase spreads on the asset side are declining faster than spreads on the liability side."",
  ""But do you think that can revert down the road as CLO managers continue to refinance or reset their liabilities?"",
  ""Nishil, when I looked at your average estimated yield on your new investments this quarter, they were down meaningfully versus the previous quarter."",
  ""Is that due to the spread tightening you've talked about on the loans or did you go up market in terms of tier and maybe are taking less risk or was there something else going on?"",
  ""Can you help us understand that?"",
  ""Nishil, I also noticed that your recurring cash flows per share declined versus the previous quarter."",
  ""Can you help us understand that?"",
  ""And I think you mentioned the October cash flows in the prepared remarks, but I didn't have a chance to write it down."",
  ""What is the implications for the fourth calendar quarter?"",
  ""That seems consistent with what I'm hearing across the space."",
  ""And my last question, I think Lauren mentioned the out-of-court restructurings and they are elevated and creating these sort of unsustainable capital structures for some companies."",
  ""And from my perspective, that just effectively kicks the can down the road."",
  ""I'm just curious how you see those transactions impacting the market in the future as we'll have to contend with that at some point."",
  ""And how are CLO managers dealing with that risk in terms of their portfolios?"",
  ""That's really helpful for us to understand and appreciate your comments there."",
  ""Those are all my questions."",
  ""I  for taking the time."",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""First on just the quarter was a busy quarter of capital raising."",
  ""If I look at $0.30 NII, I mean, was there a drag?"",
  ""I mean, was there some – can you quantify any type of drag that might have coincided with the raising and the deployment?"",
  ""In other words, if every – if all the capital raises on day one in the quarter with the NII had been higher?"",
  ""Just curious if there was some sort of implied drag."",
  ""Well, of course, we're covering the dividend, but, I mean, is that I guess enough striking distance to the common dividend where it doesn't really matter given the cash flows."",
  ""I guess that's – and that leads me to the second question."",
  ""I mean you got the ATM, you got this direct issuance, I mean you have this convertible preferred that you did."",
  ""So when you look at – so are you getting these all kind of three channels here?"",
  ""I mean, what can you talk about raising capital here in the next few quarters?"",
  ""What does it look like?"",
  ""What channel do you want to use?"",
  ""And then I have a follow-up on that convertible."",
  ""Well, but the ATM is currently highly accretive."",
  ""On that convertible preferred, I mean just go over the terms again."",
  ""I mean, you could call it, but people can exercise it after six months, but can you force conversion on it if the stock price is at a certain level?"",
  ""Just go over the terms again."",
  ""It looks like it's really attractive if you get that converted out."",
  ""It could – it obviously increases your equity base."",
  ""You can add more preferred."",
  ""Just walk – just walk over the terms again of that."",
  ""I mean, clearly where the stock is today, but you can't force conversion of it, I mean if it's trading at a certain level, get people to convert."",
  ""Either way, it's a really – I mean, that's against your equity, your leverage test, correct."",
  ""I mean, that convertible preferred is against your leverage test?"",
  ""Well, you're really into position to scale this vehicle."",
  ""Just on the refi and resets."",
  ""Did you do one or two since last quarter?"",
  ""And just the outlook on what your 49 positions or how many more you could do here Okay."",
  ""I got to go back and listen all the tax information you provided."",
  ""But – and I guess the question here is, when you look at the dividend policy and you look at the reoccurring cash flows, which obviously were $0.45."",
  ""And I don't I think they're whether recurring, you call it net – core net income, recurring cash flows were much higher than that."",
  ""It looks like they're going to go higher."",
  ""Are you going to have to pay an excise tax or is there a spillover or is the distribution enough that you don't have to pay an excise tax as there's no carryover?"",
  ""Because I mean, obviously, you've seen it's a high class problem to have with these vehicles that they can't pay enough."",
  ""The cash flows are so high, the taxable income so high, they can't get pay enough on the regular dividend to offset the requirements."",
  ""So they do spillovers, they pay excise tax."",
  ""You need to know this, would they pay specials."",
  ""I mean, just walk – just can you sort of boil it down where you guys stand, looking at your next tax calendar year?"",
  ""And you said basically the core net income is kind of the closest thing to taxable income."",
  ""Did I hear you say that if you look at going forward?"",
  ""And then, I guess, it's just – I mean, look, I'd love to hear your response."",
  ""I mean, when investors look at $0.30 NII and $0.45 core, I mean, what do you – as a firm what do you think is the true economic, true earnings like power of the company?"",
  ""Is it closer to the GAAP as opposed to the core?"",
  ""Will they both converge at some point in time in the future?"",
  ""Keep up the good work."",
  ""I think of it as a major paradigm shift for this – for the loan market and the CLO market, almost like when loans went from having a covenants and to not having covenants."",
  ""I think going forward, we're going to be living in an environment where these out-of-court distressed exchanges or liability management exercises are the dominant way that companies are going to deal with over levered capital structures."",
  ""And so what does it do?"",
  ""I think it creates more volatility for stressed loans because there's a lot more uncertainty of outcomes when you're doing an out-of-court process versus an in-court process."",
  ""You could see the same manager recover very different amount on the same – I'm sorry, a different manager recover a different amount on a loan than, let's say, a larger manager."",
  ""Meaning, I think larger managers will have an advantage with size to be able to recover higher out-of-court and I think it disadvantages small managers."",
  ""So, when we talk to some of our managers, we're seeing a trend where smaller managers are trying to exit distressed investments early, so they don't have to get to the point where they would be disadvantaged."",
  ""And when you have that type of selling, that creates volatility."",
  ""We look forward to speaking to everyone next quarter, if not sooner."",
  ""Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions."",
  ""And  again for all your support."",
  ""Hey, Mickey, how are you?"",
  ""Mickey it's Nishil, so I'll take that question."",
  ""So when I think about CLO returns, there's obviously two components of CLO returns."",
  ""One is the cash-on-cash and then two is the change in valuations."",
  ""On a cash-on-cash basis, 2024 was – actually has been a very strong year."",
  ""I think the highest cash-on-cash returns since 2016."",
  ""I think based on a par basis, I think cash-on-cash yields were in the mid to high-teens."",
  ""So, it's actually been a very good year for CLO equity in that aspect."",
  ""Conversely, you have seen some decline in CLO valuations."",
  ""That's mainly a function of the fact that, as Lauren mentioned, about a third to almost a half of the loan market has seen repricings, where the borrowers are cutting spreads by about 50 basis points."",
  ""So, the overall market has seen about 20 to 25 basis points of overall decline in the weighted average spread."",
  ""So, from a valuation standpoint that is factored into the future cash flows and the valuations that our third-party agent provides."",
  ""And so, that's resulted in the decline in NAV."",
  ""So, a strong year when it comes to cash-on-cash, obviously it could be a better year when it comes to the valuations from the CLO equity."",
  ""So, the one way to offset the decline of weighted average spread is to do the refinancings and resets."",
  ""And so far in 2024, it's been a record year for the overall market."",
  ""For CCIF, specifically, we've completed about seven refinancings and resets."",
  ""So, it's something that we're always focused on and looking to optimize the portfolio and extend the reinvestment period."",
  ""The one thing I would mention is when a CLO is typically refinanced or reset, you typically have a two-year non-call period."",
  ""So, you can only do it every two years or so."",
  ""Whereas on the loan side and we're already seeing this, the typical non-call period is only six months."",
  ""And so, we're already seeing borrowers come back to the market twice this year to reprice their loans."",
  ""So, it's something that we are trying to combat with refinancings and resets."",
  ""And it's been incredibly helpful that CLO debt spreads are close to all-time tights and that's been hugely beneficial, but, but it hasn't been enough to offset the repricings."",
  ""And you mentioned a couple of factors."",
  ""I think there's three main drivers of that."",
  ""One, when we ramped this portfolio initially, mainly in the second half last year, it was still fairly volatile period."",
  ""So we were able to take advantage of that and purchase investments in the secondary market at discounted prices, which resulted in an elevated GAAP yield."",
  ""So obviously, those discounted prices are no longer available in the market today, just given the tightening we've seen."",
  ""Two, when you've seen the decline in weighted average spreads across the market, that also impacts new investments as well."",
  ""And then three, we are, I think, going higher quality."",
  ""If you think about just the overall fixed income markets, trading near all-time tights, investment-grade bonds, on a spread basis, are trading at the tightest level since, I think, 1997 or 1998."",
  ""High-yield bonds are trading at the tightest level since pre-financial crisis."",
  ""So we don't think today is the right time to be stretching for risk."",
  ""And so we're definitely looking to add more defensive positions, which will have lower GAAP yield."",
  ""So I think we mentioned we had $0.70 of recurring cash flow per share for the third quarter."",
  ""And then the fourth quarter, which really reflects the payments and – the quarterly payments on October, it actually increased to about $0.72 per share."",
  ""And so, there is some seasonality when it comes to the cash flows because CLOs have limited exposure to high yield bonds, which typically pay on a semi-annual basis."",
  ""And then just back to the repricings, as the loan market continues to reprice that results in slightly lower cash-on-cash yields as well."",
  ""Sorry Mickey, I would add to that, what's really helpful for CCIF is being part of the larger Carlyle platform, given Carlyle today is the – it is the largest or second largest CLO manager globally and we have a six person workout group."",
  ""And whenever we are in loan that is stressed or distressed, that team is typically on the steering committee driving kind of the results of a lot of these restructurings in distressed exchanges."",
  ""So, we get incredibly helpful insight on what is going on in the overall market."",
  ""Just trends we're seeing in terms of distressed exchanges, which has been incredibly helpful when just looking at the overall market and market trends when it comes to defaults and distressed exchanges."",
  ""It's good to hear from you."",
  ""So, I'll take that question."",
  ""We did have an active quarter when it came to fundraising between the ATM, the direct common stock offering, and the convertible preferred."",
  ""So there was some drag associated with that."",
  ""But I think on a go-forward basis, obviously we can't provide projections."",
  ""But the $0.30 NII, I don't think we're expecting that to increase materially in forward quarters just from the lack of drag."",
  ""Look, obviously it's completely market-dependent, but our goal here is – really the Fund, we still think, is somewhat subscale and we see that in the liquidity of the stock and the overall trading volume."",
  ""And so, our goal is to grow the Fund which we think will make better for investors."",
  ""And so, we are going to look at all avenues and how we can efficiently leverage the Fund, but also more importantly accretively raise common stock, which increases NAV as well."",
  ""So, I think we'll continue to be active when it comes to capital markets activity."",
  ""The ATM is something that I think we'll continue to utilize and TBD if we'll be able to issue incremental convertible preferreds or direct Yeah."",
  ""And so, look obviously, I think the expectation is the holders will want to convert at some point."",
  ""But I think what makes it attractive for us is even if it's not converted, the coupon on the five-year convertible preferred is 7.125%."",
  ""That's materially lower than the initial preferred that we completed last November."",
  ""So, even if they do not convert, we think it's a very efficient way to leverage the Fund."",
  ""Now, some key terms are the Fund has the option to redeem after a six-month period at par."",
  ""But the holders, after a six-month period also have the option to convert into common shares."",
  ""And that would be done at the higher of NAV and the average of the previous five-day closing price."",
  ""So, if there is conversion, it would be obviously at NAV or higher."",
  ""So it would be accretive for the Fund."",
  ""No...  Yeah, that's right."",
  ""And so I think today we have about $63 million – $62 million, $63 million of convertible preferred outstanding and our net assets is around $120 million."",
  ""So it's about a Yeah."",
  ""We do think there is demand and so market dependent, we could issue more of that because we agree with you that there's a lot of attractive features of the convertible preferred that we found to be beneficial for the Fund."",
  ""So to be honest, I can come back to you on exactly how many we did last quarter."",
  ""I know we've done seven year-to-date and activity has definitely picked up as CLO debt spreads continue to compress."",
  ""The one thing I mentioned is – or the number of resets and refis we've done is probably a smaller number than some of our peer funds."",
  ""That's probably more a function of where our portfolio is today in terms of that."",
  ""Only two of our investments are out of reinvestment period, and we've already reset one of them."",
  ""We expect to reset the other one this quarter."",
  ""And so, just the number of resets is probably not as high as some of our peer funds, but we're actively looking to optimize both portfolio."",
  ""And our expectation is, at least for the first quarter of next year, you'll continue to see this elevated activity and so we'll look to continue to refinance and reset the portfolio."",
  ""It's around two-and-a-half years and by the end of this year, I don't think we will have a single CLO that's out of reinvestment period."",
  ""It's like – it's a great question and it's something we spend a lot of time on senior management here, and it's a lot of discussions we have with the board."",
  ""I think, admittedly, the taxable income calculation for CLO equity is extremely complex."",
  ""I thought I knew a lot about the tax accounting for CLO equity, but it seems like I learn something new every year."",
  ""And so, you've had this – we've had this one-time phenomenon this year where because of the timing mismatch between when the annual statements or the PFIC statements are actually issued versus where our fiscal year end is, our taxable income from this year is really a fraction of our recurring cash flow, a fraction of core NII."",
  ""Obviously, that's a one-time thing."",
  ""So we won't see that going forward."",
  ""But it's something we are looking and trying to estimate of what is going to be taxable income for the Fund in 2025, how does that compare to our current dividends."",
  ""And we can at least use the spillover if we need to."",
  ""That's really a short-term solution."",
  ""Obviously, long-term, we need to make sure that our dividend policy aligns with kind of the tax distribution requirements."",
  ""So, I think that's definitely how we are estimating what we think taxable income will be."",
  ""And so that core NII of $0.45."",
  ""Obviously, with the dividend being $0.315, that doesn't line up yet."",
  ""But the one thing that we need to factor in is this timing mismatch and how that impacts the taxable income on a go-forward basis."",
  ""Because if you think about it...  As I was going to say, so if you think about it, most of our taxable income will be based on the investments from the prior year."",
  ""And if we are growing the Fund, you are going to have this mismatch of the taxable income for any fiscal year."",
  ""It's going to be based on your portfolio from the prior year."",
  ""So that's something we'll have to factor in, in our analysis of what our distribution policy should be versus taxable income."",
  ""Again, another great question because when you think of income for CLOs , you can get three, five different answers of what's right income number for CLOs."",
  ""We think like – obviously, our focus is as a closed-end fund, we have to pay out 90% of taxable income."",
  ""And so we think core NII is the best proxy for that distribution requirement."",
  ""And so our dividend policy really, we'll focus on that with the caveat of factoring in kind of this timing mismatch that we've talked about.""

  ""It has been a positive nine months and I think it has been a nine-month milestone growth period for the company."",
  ""We have been given the ability to reallocate some of our older assets, monetize them and move forward with state-of-the-art new vessels."",
  ""21 new vessel program acquiring a 5 vessel company earlier in the year, taking delivery of our dual fuel vessels and we're still with 12 vessels to be taken delivery starting from April 2025."",
  ""We're going to be taking over three or four vessels within 2025."",
  ""So it's a very active period for the company and we've been able to be active, increase liquidity, significantly pay down debt, continue and increase our dividend policy, both for the common and for the preferreds."",
  ""And we are facing an environment where there is a huge appetite for our services by our major players, where about 60% of our business has been provided by six major energy companies."",
  ""I think Exxon is in the forefront, followed by Equinor, Total, BP and Shell."",
  ""All of them first class names to we're very proud to be partners in energy transportation going forward."",
  ""There is a big appetite for good quality ships."",
  ""We are at the crossroads of a technology change in our business and the prospects, the medium and long-term prospects of the business are positive, I think as we have stated in our press release."",
  ""However, we as a company, as the Chairman said, we have been trying to take the However, our share price As I said, milestone 2024, so far a big growth, very exciting prospects going forward."",
  ""The business at least close to $2 billion of new business coming in."",
  ""We have significantly increased our rates And with that, I'll ask our President to give us a quick overview of what's going on with the company."",
  ""And  for describing a very busy period in a very efficient and timely way."",
  ""I think what is important is that we are maintaining our industrial energy transportation model."",
  ""We try to take enough advantage of the upside when the market is."",
  ""But we always and I think what is important of our long and continuous dividend payment, if you go back to the expenses side and I think this is a very good description of, let's say, this is slide number 8."",
  ""I mean, the way we have been able to go on for the last 31 years, we make sure that our first class charters who are more than I think 60% or 70% of our income comes from long-term employment and profit sharing arrangements."",
  ""They cover all and when I say all our obligations, including depreciation, our interest, paying down – depreciation and debt repayment for us is very similar because of the modernity of the ships that we have."",
  ""So that's how we refer, I mean, we might not be the most exciting shipping company out there, but we are an industrial company."",
  ""We want to keep TEN for the next generation, a bit like the Patek Philippe advertisement, you never own one, you keep it for the next generation."",
  ""And that's what we are here to do."",
  ""And that has kept us going for 30 years, been able to pay dividends for 30 years."",
  ""Our peer group, which is the first class companies out there, which we are proud to be associated and operate in the same environment, all of them have different strategy and we are all for diversity."",
  ""Otherwise, it would have been a very, very boring peer group, if we all did the same."",
  ""You have most of the companies out there, they focus in one segment of the energy transportation and it's a very fragmented industry."",
  ""They play a significant role."",
  ""Companies are in the VLCC, other companies are in suezmaxes, other companies are just broader carriers."",
  ""We are what they call Also on the commercial side with offices around the world, we have academies in the Philippines."",
  ""I mean, we take shipping seriously, and that's why we are able to have these results through the cycle."",
  ""I was very, very happy to see that our operating expenses in an inflationary environment with bigger ships had a 10% increase."",
  ""And I think that is – decrease, that and our income had an increase, that is very complementary in difficult times."",
  ""So, I believe we should be looking at closer to industrial or infrastructure company valuations rather than just in the shipping valuations."",
  ""I mean, we tend to go up and down together with our peer group, whether we have been able to or we're trying to do and we have been proven to be able to take out the edges over a cyclical market as much as possible."",
  ""I'm sure that is even better to do."",
  ""But we will try to do better every day."",
  ""So with that, I would like to open the floor."",
  ""And all of us are here to answer any questions that you may have."",
  ""I am Nicolas Bornozis, President of Capital Link and Investor Relations Advisor to Tsakos Energy Navigation."",
  ""This morning, the company publicly released its financial results for the nine months and the third quarter ended September 30, 2024."",
  ""In case you do not have a copy of today's , please call us at 212-661-7566 or email us at ten@capitallink.com and we will have a copy for you emailed right away."",

  ""The conference call will follow the presentation slides."",
  ""So, please, we urge you to access the presentation slides on the company's website."",
  ""Please note that the slides of the webcast presentation will be available and archived on the website of the company after the conference call."",
  ""Also, please note that the slides of the webcast presentation are user controlled and that means that by clicking on the proper button, you can move to the next or to the previous slide on your own."",
  ""At this time, I would like to read the Safe Harbor statement."",
  ""This conference call and also the presentation of the webcast contain certain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Safe Harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may affect TEN's business prospects and results of operations."",
  ""And before passing the floor over to Mr. Arapoglou, the Chairman of Tsakos Energy Navigation, I'd like to congratulate the company for being awarded Tanker Operator of the Year after the inauguration of the first private naval academy in Greece."",
  ""That shows the efficiency of the company's operation and also its focus on the welfare of the crews."",
  ""And with this, I would like to pass the floor to Mr. Arapoglou, the Chairman of Tsakos Energy Navigation."",
  "" for joining our call today."",
  ""In a market admittedly off its earlier peak, yet still with firm business and geopolitical fundamentals, TEN continues to be sustainably profitable, steadily generating equity, maintaining itself healthy cash position, increasing its dividends by 50%, offering a substantial dividend yield on today's price and continuously renewing and increasing its fleet with state-of-the-art vessels."",
  ""The company's industrial model characterized by nearly $2 billion of forward contracted accretive revenue and proven operational excellence ensures the continuation of its stable, sustainably profitable performance and rewarding of its shareholders handling market cyclicality in an efficient way."",
  ""So, congratulations again, once again, in order to Nikolas Tsakos and his management team on this performance and best wishes for more successes going forward."",
  ""And over to Mr. Nikolas Tsakos."",
  ""2024 continues to be a good year for tankers and for TEN for the same reasons that were played out for the last two and a half years."",
  ""We are one of the largest and most established energy transporters worldwide."",
  ""We have transported 460 million barrels per day in 2023 safely."",
  ""That's about 23 days of US consumption or 5% of global oil consumption."",
  ""We have celebrated 31 years in the public markets and since our listing in 2002 in the New York Stock Exchange, we have paid uninterrupted dividends to our common shareholders."",
  ""We have built a big, modern, diversified fleet."",
  ""We have developed an industrial shipping model, and we have one of the highest repeat caliber clients with ExxonMobil leading the way with 22% of the revenue followed by Equinor, Shell, Chevron, TotalEnergies, BP and others."",
  ""We have, as we have embarked in our decarbonization journey and started our green energy program, we find ourselves in 2024 as one of the largest dual fuel operators with vessels in the water."",
  ""We have six LNG aframax powered vessels and being the carrier of choice of energy majors for their transportation requirements, we continue to fix vessels whose charter expires or book new business."",
  ""And currently, the backlog that we have is $1.8 billion."",
  ""This is minimum secured revenues Moving on to the next slide, we have been – TEN was created in the aftermath of OPA 90, which is the regulation for the double-hull for the – the introduction of double-hull vessels."",
  ""Since then we have faced six major crises and we manage everytime to come out of its crisis stronger and bigger."",
  ""If we look at the fleet that we have built today in slide number 5, you see a very diversified fleet that caters to the needs of our clients, spanning from crude carriers to product tankers, LNGs and shuttle tankers."",
  ""Today, we have a pro forma fleet of 74 vessels, 62 operating in the water and 12 newbuildings under constructions."",
  ""The red and the blue color vessels in the slide denote vessels trading in the spot and period market with profit sharing, while the black colored vessels on fixed time charters."",
  ""As you can see at the bottom of the slide, 31 of the 62 vessels in the water have market exposure."",
  ""This is spot and vessels with profit sharing arrangements and 49 out of the 62 vessels in the water or 79% are in secured employment, time charters and time charters with profit sharing."",
  ""The next slide basically shows our access to our capital markets."",
  ""We have grown the company since, here you see in blue the capital, the common capital raising that we have in the red is through the preferred shares, we have retired four series of preferred shares for $223 million and we have used the capital markets as a growth engine, as a growth engine for our fleet renewal."",
  ""We have built an industrial model in slide 7, as you can see with the list of our charterers."",
  ""As you can see, this is a blue chip client base with the biggest clients being Exxon, followed by Equinor, Shell, Chevron and Total."",
  ""We have on slide 8, the left side of the slide shows you the all-in breakeven cost for the vessels on a net income basis and basically the time charter vessels serve to cover the expenses, the operating expenses, the finance expenses and all the other overheads that we have, while the spot trading vessels basically serve for the upside and the dividend distributions to our shareholders."",
  ""For every $1,000 increase in spot rates, this has a positive impact of $0.16 in annual EPS based on the current vessels in the spot market as of the nine months of 2023."",
  ""Managing debt is an integral part of the company's strategy and capital allocation."",
  ""We have grown the fleet significantly with larger, more specialized vessels."",
  ""The debt levels have remained more or less at a level that is very manageable."",
  ""The net debt to cap currently stands at 44%."",
  ""This shows the fuel – the next slide, slide 10 shows the fleet renewal and Greenship growth since January 1, 2023."",
  ""We have sold 13 vessels with an average age of 17.5 years and 1 million total deadweight ton and have replaced them with 21 vessels with an average age of 1 year and 2.3 million deadweight ton."",
  ""This doubling in quality and the size of the fleet, we have the company spring board the next growth phase."",
  "" So I guess, I'll take you over the financials on the... ..., George."",
  ""I'll take you over the financials for the nine months and the three months results."",
  ""So during the first nine months of 2024, TEN operated 62 vessels, three more than equivalent 2023 period, of which 11 underwent scheduled dry dockings."",
  ""As a result, the corresponding fleet utilization for the 2024 nine months was at 92.2% from 95.6% during the same 2023 period."",
  ""As energy majors' appetite for term employment increased, emphasis was placed on obtaining such secured revenue contracts to take advantage of the elevated rates offered and as a result, the mix between secured revenues and spot Fleet operating expenses of $147 million increased in line with the larger number and size of vessels in the fleet after the various acquisitions and divestments during the nine-month period."",
  ""Operating expenses per ship per day, however, was 3.3% lower from the 2023 nine months at $9,306."",
  "" again to efficient management performed by TEN's technical experts onshore and onboard the vessels."",
  ""Time charter equivalent per ship per day during this period impacted by the aforementioned drydockings and less days in market related contracts settled at a still healthy $33,390, 3.6 times higher the above daily vessel operating expense rate."",
  ""Reflecting all the above, a net income of $157 million was recorded for the first nine months of 2027 generating EPS of $4.62."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for the 2024 nine months was up $314 million."",
  ""Interest and finance costs of $87.4 million during the 2024 nine months reflected the new loans for vessel acquisitions and newbuilding deliveries, as well as continuing elevated global interest rates."",
  ""Despite the material drop in spread, TEN has achieved due to its pristine track record on its debt obligations."",
  ""However, this inevitable and controlled cost increase was to a large extent mitigated by about $4 million in reduced coupon payments on outstanding preferreds from the amount paid during the equivalent 2023 nine months and $5 million savings in forward bareboat hire from the repurchase of two suezmaxes on leasing contract in the summer of 2024."",
  ""Cash on bank at the end of September 2024 was at $386 million, $9.5 million higher from the December 2023 level."",
  ""And that is after having paid $258 million for common and preferred dividends, for growth projects and the exercise of the above lease and repurchase options."",
  ""Now, the results for the third quarter of 2024 were equally attractive, considering that 3 out of the 11 vessels that underwent drydocking happened during this quarter."",
  ""A fleet of 62 vessels as opposed to 58 in the third quarter of 2023 generated gross revenues of $200 million and operating income of $57 million compared to $187 million and $53 million for the third quarter of 2023, respectively."",
  ""Neither of these two comparable quarters had gains or losses from vessel sales."",
  ""Fleet operating expenses of $49 million for the third quarter of 2024 were $1.6 million lower from the 2023 third quarter level, despite the three drydockings mentioned above, and the larger fleet size, both in terms of numbers and deadweight."",
  ""Operating expenses per ship per day were at $9,988, almost $1,000 lower than 2023 third quarter number."",
  ""Time charter equivalent per ship per day closed the quarter 3.5 times above the OpEx number up $32,539, about $1,200 higher compared to last year's third quarter."",
  ""The resulting net income of $26.5 million producing earnings per share of $0.67 reflected the $5 million increase in depreciation and amortization costs the larger fleet entailed."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA finished the quarter at $100 million, $8.5 million above the level of the 2023 third quarter."",
  ""As of September 30, 2024, the fleet fair market value was about $4 billion and total debt $1.8 billion corresponding to the higher fleet size as a result of four dual fuel LNG powered aframax newbuildings and five more secondhand vessels entering the fleet."",
  ""At the same time, net debt to capital remained at a very comfortable 44%."",
  ""In ending and supported by the aforementioned results, TEN will pay a second semi-annual common stock dividend of $0.09 on December 20, 2024, bringing the total distribution for 2024 to $1.50 per common share, 50% higher than 2023 amount yielding approximately 7.5% on today's price."",
  ""And with this, I turn back to Nikolas for the closing remarks.""

  ""If we can just sort of focus on the macro initially, can you just sort of give me an idea of sort of how you're thinking about with the US elections, the potential for tighter sanctions on Russia, Iran and potentially Venezuela?"",
  ""The problem of Secretary of State, when you look at it, Nikolas, with the potential of tighter sanctions, if they did restrict the flow of oil out of Iran especially, it would take the dark fleet market or the darker gray fleet, as you say, do you think they get pushed into retirement or is there potential for somebody else to get cleaned up and maybe into the unsanctioned fleet?"",
  ""And then can we just talk about the newbuild program?"",
  ""I think in your 6-K, you indicated that you had about $110 million to spend in CapEx for the second half of the year in 2024."",
  ""Can you give me an idea how much was spent in the third quarter and then how much will be spent on the newbuild program in the fourth quarter?"",
  ""Yeah, I was trying to focus on what the total installments were in respect of how you pronounce them."",
  ""So, Harrys, could you – how much did you spend in the third quarter?"",
  ""Maybe we can do a call later this week."",
  ""And then in the second quarter, there is a little bit of twist that's on the financials as far as now, you have time deposits."",
  ""Can you, if you have the time deposit figure for the third quarter?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I wanted to start by asking order to suezmax newbuilds That's helpful."",
  ""I also wanted to ask about drydocking days during the quarter because that weighed on utilization."",
  ""But on top of that, there was also some commercial hire."",
  ""Could you talk a bit about your drydocking schedule going forward, both for Q4 and for 2025?"",
  ""And secondly, we are now two months into fourth quarter."",
  ""Do you expect including commercial hire as well during the quarter?"",
  ""And for 2025, how many vessels?"",
  ""And then on the commercial hire for Q4."",
  ""On commercial hire for Q4, do you expect to incur any off-hire days on top of the off-hire for drydocking?"",
  ""This one is more on the modelling side."",
  ""General and administrative expenses increased substantially both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year."",
  ""Could you talk a bit about the drivers behind this and whether we should think about it as a one-off or not?"",
  ""So for Q4, we should expect G&A to revert to lower then."",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""Well, I have to be chosen as Secretary of State to be able to answer this."",
  ""But, I am just a poor great shipowner, but I mean, as long as it affects us."",
  ""I think we are – in general, shipping would flourishes when we have open borders, open seas, and there are no sanctions."",
  ""However, we are in a situation where 25% of the world fleet, I mean, that's a huge oil tanker fleet is what we call a great fleet, which means that we have not the remaining of us, the 75% that, of course, do not participate in any sanctioned business, are able to take advantage of the first class business without the competition of So I think sanctions right now are working for the benefit of first class companies in our peer group, because we do not have – I mean, the average age of what they call the gray fleet is above or close to 20 years."",
  ""So we don't want to have those ships again in the Med or in the Caribs or in the Far East, undercutting good quality, responsible shipping operators."",
  ""In a sense, it has a positive."",
  ""If and on top of that, of course, we are not navigator, we never put our seafarers at risk."",
  ""And our charterers has never, never insisted."",
  ""I mean, the quality of the charterers we operate never insisted."",
  ""For us to ever cross the Red Sea if we didn't feel or our captains do not feel safe and they do not feel safe, and I think, I respect."",
  ""That's why we're doing business with the top tier clients."",
  ""I know other colleague of ours that have been that – that actually charter ships to lesser concerns are continuously pushed to cut corners and try and put those seafarers in danger and cross the energy."",
  ""And we've had incidents that could do have been environmental disasters and also with human loss."",
  ""But this is something TEN does not do."",
  ""Now, if now with a magic stick, one day we can put the world in peace, I think that will be even better for shipping."",
  ""We would have gotten rid of a big number of all the ships that are really rundown."",
  ""So they could not charter to major energy companies again."",
  ""And we will have more places to – there will be huge construction hopefully of – in the Black Sea of Ukraine and Russia."",
  ""And if there is peace in the Middle East, which there is room or there is a really huge reconstruction there."",
  ""So, yeah, a peaceful world is a much better world for shipping."",
  ""Sorry for the long answer."",
  ""Well, I think a big part of it will not be able to reenter – the majority of those ships will not be able to reenter the competitive market."",
  ""I mean, energy shipping, LNG and tanker and LPG and, of course, oil are very, very under tight environmental concerns from our clients."",
  ""I mean, every ship has to be inspected every six months in order to, and if it's not in a perfect fleet, it will not be touched."",
  ""So I think those ships who will take a very long time to be in a perfect setting, it won't be worth for it because there will not be a reason."",
  ""So I think we will see increase of scrapping of older tonnage."",
  ""Harrys got the spending, and I do the earnings."",
  ""We try to keep the majority of our cash rolling and having interest on a daily basis."",
  ""So we have an average interest income of more than 4% and 5% in the – so we always have time deposits and the money, the $400 million or $380 million we have, yields earnings is a 4% to 5% interest on a daily basis, regardless if it's time deposit or not."",
  ""So the majority of it, you can consider it that is on time deposits."",
  ""I mean, these are, I mean, three and five year contracts for those ships to one of our biggest client."",
  ""We're not supposed to spill all the beans here over the floor."",
  ""And at very, very accretive, the minimum, if you look on page 8 where we have our all-in breakevens."",
  ""I think our minimum rate for the next three to five years is almost twice our breakeven."",
  ""So that's a very, it's going to add a significant amount of net income, cash flow and for us who are big shareholders dividend going forward."",
  ""I think we will be in the same utilization period."",
  ""Yeah, this is a one-off because we have, as I think you have seen, an incentive plan, share incentive plan for our personnel, so that is taking."",
  ""So it's really not a cash, it's not really a cash increase."",
  ""It's just an increase that we have to take in consideration for the incentive plan."",
  ""So it is a one-off."",
  ""I hope that our revamped presentation keeps you all a bit more animated with the slides, and I think later going to be So, looking forward to be able to get the share price, make the share price great again, as someone said and move up forward."",
  ""The team will be in the United States early December doing a non-deal roadshow."",
  ""So we would love to be able to see really face to face or zoom call on your side or those that are in the United States."",
  ""And with that, I would like to  and wish you a very happy giving to everybody."",
  ""And I hope our CFO's present of a big dividend would help giving and would not steal Christmas."",
  ""So, the total program was just over or approximately $950 million."",
  ""The remaining for this year, so to give you kind of more updated figures because from the 6-K, things have changed in terms of new loans acquired and equity installments paid."",
  ""So we still have for the remainder of the year to pay $21.5 million of which about two-thirds of that will be bank debt and the rest, call it, $8 million, $9 million of equity."",
  ""The remaining we're still discussing with various banks in raising commercial financing today."",
  ""On the 12 vessels we have kind of agreed, signed on three and we are very close on sign debt arrangements for the majority of the others."",
  ""So as you can imagine, the payments would alter, but to give you kind of a high level answer, for so as I said, approximately $21.5 million remaining in the fourth quarter."",
  ""And for 2025, we assume we expect and assuming those bank loans will come forth."",
  ""We're very close in agreeing approximately just over $100 million of equity payments that we expect assume to come from our own coffers, if you like, for 2025."",
  ""So it all depends on the various installments that we need to pay and sometimes, the flip into the next quarter or the year following."",
  ""Yeah, because of each vessel has a different kind of pattern, so we can have it offline to sort of give you kind of a general and down to the dollar detailed...  , Poe."",
  ""So in terms of drydocking days, I mean, we usually assume anywhere between, let's say on average about 30 days, 35 days and we expect in the fourth quarter to have three to four vessels undergoing scheduled drydockings."",
  ""It's plus one, because one, we'll have to go drydock when the vessels are in bareboat, so we will not incur that cost."",
  ""So three or four vessels that will pass, there are special service and we will incur the cost and one, it will not have any bearing on us."",
  ""Sorry, and your other question?"",
  ""For next year, 2025, it is estimated approximately 10 vessels will have to undergo a special service, drydocking.""

  "" so much, And during today's call, we'll talk about our third quarter, in particular, but we will start with giving a little bit of a background talking about Albert for those of you who are new to us, then we'll talk about the Q3 in specific."",
  ""And then a few words about what's ahead of us."",
  ""And then, as But before getting started, I'm just going to summarize, Albert very quickly and then third quarter."",
  ""So Albert started as the math app Albert some years ago, but has now developed into a leading Nordic Edtech Group, where we have focus on the Nordics, the UK and the US."",
  ""We sell both into schools, B2B, and to families, B2C. And the benefit of having both those two target groups is that we have dual revenue streams with predictability and stability from selling to schools, with the scalability, from selling to consumers."",
  ""Our products and offerings are focused on the core subjects that you learn in school, which means math, science, coding, and learning to read and spell."",
  ""And all our products are based on research and the curriculum."",
  ""Looking at what makes us unique, then is the engagement that we combine gamification, creativity and pedagogy to really create good and engaging products."",
  ""Talking more about the financial, we are on a journey towards profitability, where we have now set really clear targets to reach positive EBITDA next year in 2025, and then reach positive cash flow in 2026 with the cash at hand."",
  ""And that also means that we are well funded, and with the cash we have, we should reach positive cash flow."",
  ""And summarizing the third quarter, I can say, it's been an operationally very good quarter."",
  ""I mean, Q3 is almost a very important quarter for us, and we have had really good invoiced sales in the period, which is up 11%."",
  ""But so far as we are selling annual subscriptions and longer subscriptions, they have not been recognized."",
  ""So the net revenue is down with 5%."",
  "" to the good momentum in marketing and sales."",
  ""We've also decided to invest more in marketing to build a good pipeline, all leads and free trial customers."",
  ""That is adding cost now in the short-term, but that will benefit us in the longer-term."",
  ""We can also see in the third quarter that we have reduced staff costs."",
  ""We had a major restructuring in our Swedish operations in the first quarter."",
  ""Now we can see the full effect of those ones."",
  ""And we have also now in the third quarter, made a restructuring in our French operations, but that we don't see in the result yet, and that will come in 2025."",
  ""So all in all, this means that sort of the delayed revenues in combination with costs that we've already taken out creates a temporary dip in profitability."",
  ""But all of this is in line with our profitability plan to reach positive EBITDA in 2025."",
  ""But you will hear much more about this during this upcoming presentation."",
  ""And I'll start with going back and talk a little bit about Albert and why we exist, and we are playing in the education field, and we are here because we – there are so many kids who are struggling in school, and especially with subjects like mathematics or science with many kids, things are challenging, and it can be due to motivation or other things."",
  ""And one of the reasons, why kids are struggling is that the lack of equal access to qualified teachers."",
  ""Since some schools you get access to good teachers, and some you don't."",
  ""And depending on the support you get from school, you get more or less dependent on the support you can get from home."",
  ""But not all kids can get full support from home either."",
  ""And this has created an issue, where the school results, in general, are declining in many countries, Sweden and in our core markets in particular."",
  ""And especially, the socioeconomics are playing a big role in it."",
  ""So if you grow up in a socioeconomic poor area, it's typically much more challenging."",
  ""So this is a problem we want to be part of solving and it's also a good problem to be part of solving because this is a growing market."",
  ""And therefore, our mission is to help every child reach their full potential by making learning engaging and personalized."",
  ""And these two words are so important because that's really, where edtech comes into play."",
  ""We talk a lot about this one internally, and when we see customers and users out there, sort of what makes us unique."",
  ""And if you look on the one axis here on the horizontal one, there are many players out there who work with different educational products and some are more game-like or some are very deep education products."",
  ""And then you have the vertical line, which is that sort of how engaging are them, like typical traditional textbooks are often perceived to be quite boring."",
  ""And then you have many other things like especially very game-like games that are engaging and fun that kids really like to use."",
  ""And in general, you can say that most players out there, they are either down in sort of really strong education products that are perceived to be quite boring for children in school and at home, or they are very fun and engaging to use, but then they're often very game-like and not that educational, and our USP is to combine these things, to have our roots in education and pedagogy and the curriculum."",
  ""But really be engaging in fun for the children and that we managed to do, to achieve by combination, combining gamification and creativity and storytelling to really create products that the kids love."",
  ""And at the same time, they are really good from a learning perspective, so also the teachers, parents."",
  ""So what we want to achieve is to put the learners, the children or the teenagers in the center."",
  ""And then we want to work with them in the school together with the teachers and at home together with the parents, because the children, they learn in both of those two arenas."",
  ""And therefore, it's so important for us to consider both of them, which don't many others are doing."",
  ""And to do it, we're working on building a portfolio and have built the portfolio of really good learning products."",
  ""Our core is really a digital learning apps in the core subjects, mathematics, reading, spelling, programming and so on."",
  ""But we also have hands on kids for learning STEM or science and construction and programming."",
  ""And we also work with educational films, because that's very appreciated in schools by kids and teachers to really introduce new concepts before you really talk about the theories behind them."",
  ""And these products are being sold under eight different product brands."",
  ""And we are focusing on the Swedish and Nordic markets, the UK and the US, but especially with our B2C products, we are also present in many more markets, especially around in Europe."",
  ""And that was my quick introduction of Albert."",
  ""And now we will put the focus on the third quarter."",
  ""But before actually talking about the third quarter, I would like to go back to quarter one."",
  ""For those of you who have been around or followed us for some time, in the first quarter or actually in the end of January, we launched a profitability program, because we were so dedicated to get towards profitability."",
  ""And I will not go through the details, but in general, it was about focusing more on business-to-business because that's where we were most profitable and the most stable."",
  ""We also wanted to focus on maximizing and optimizing the current business by really doubling down on what's working well and sort of reallocate resources to those areas."",
  ""And up in the yellow box was very much about sort of ensure that we increase efficiency and we can find synergies in the group."",
  ""So it's been a lot about like, yeah, rightsizing and putting the resources, where it makes sense."",
  ""And the last one was more about general like cost reductions like offices and different type of services and so on."",
  ""Most of these actions were taken back in Q1, and we can now in this quarter start to see the results of some of them, but we have also conducted a strategic review throughout the summer of different markets and products and so on to really take the next step in this one, and we'll come back to that soon."",
  ""But now again, I just mention a few like operational key points about the third quarter, before handing over to Katarina to talk about the financials."",
  ""And the first thing, I would like to get a little bit more in depth about is sales."",
  ""Like the third quarter is typically our most important sales quarter of the year."",
  ""In B2C, it's summer and summer break, and in B2B, it's about back to school or preparing for a new school year."",
  ""And both these areas are so important."",
  ""So succeeding here is super crucial for us for the upcoming year."",
  ""But starting with the B2C side, having a summer, summer break and so on often means resting for some children."",
  ""But for a lot of them, it's also about preparing for the next school year."",
  ""Typically for children, who are struggling, it's a time of the year to be able to catch up."",
  ""So they catch the next school year and get the flying start."",
  ""And for the more motivated children, they are often, sort of generally, they don't want to let go off school, they want to practice also in the summertime."",
  ""And this is something we've seen for many years as the summer has always been a good customer acquisition period for us."",
  ""And therefore, it was so much fun this year to see that the summer campaign that we were running was the best one in over 18 months."",
  ""It started already like the very first weeks, where we – typically, if we reach more than 1,000 customers in the customer acquisition in a specific day, it's something we go out and celebrate."",
  ""But now it was like day after day, week after week, we had more than 1,000 customers signing up, meaning that we – when we summarized the campaign, we reached 110% of the volume target we have set up."",
  ""And that was an aggressive volume target, because if we compare to the summer 2023, we doubled the volume this time, which was super fan."",
  ""But it also meant that since we had such good momentum in customer acquisition, we also decided to increase the marketing spend to really capture that great momentum out there."",
  ""So looking at the financial implications, so this means that we spent more marketing money during the summer than we did the previous years, but we also managed to build a good portfolio now paying subscribers, which we benefited a bit from in this quarter, but it will benefit us even more in the upcoming quarters."",
  ""Looking on the business-to-business side or sales to schools, this is a very important period for us, especially for the Sumdog business in the UK and the US and Sumdog is our maths product for schools."",
  ""And since this is so crucial, we had a lot of focus on preparing this period in the best way possible."",
  ""Partly, we had worked a lot with existing customers because renewals or like avoiding churn stands for the absolute majority of sales."",
  ""So we have been focusing on improving things in the product, restructured our customer success organization, and introduce new ways of working and something really have them be close to our customers."",
  ""And this proved to be really successful as we managed to reduce churn during this period with one-third."",
  ""And also, the new customer acquisition was successful,  to marketing and sales."",
  ""So together, we increased the invoiced sales by 17% 1-7% compared to the same period last year."",
  ""But the contracts we sell in Sumdog, they are – all of them are annual subscriptions or multi-year subscriptions, meaning that they will be periodized for the upcoming contract period."",
  ""So we just see a little share of that in the revenues this quarter."",
  ""So all in all, it's very good that we had a good Q3 in terms of customer acquisition and sales."",
  ""The other area I would like to focus on is, I mean the theme that we have had for the full year, which is really about optimizing the current business and sort of doubling down on areas that are performing well."",
  ""We knew when we entered the year, a number of actions that we wanted to take, but we also know – knew that we had to do strategic review during the summer to really look into all our different markets, all our different products and organizations to see, are they rightsized?"",
  ""Do we have the right level of resources in relation to the value that we are creating from them?"",
  ""And when we could summarize that review?"",
  ""I mean, we concluded that we have a few areas, which are really key for us, and if we translate to products, that's Albert Junior, Strawbees, Sumdog, Film & Skola."",
  ""And from a market perspective, it's the Nordics with Sweden in particular, it's the US and the UK."",
  ""So we have now decided to really focus on these products and these markets and doubling down on them and reallocate resources to those areas."",
  ""But that meant that we also had to choose some areas where we wanted to focus less on."",
  ""And then our review concluded that then it's looking outside those markets, and especially some bigger markets, which we have started to invest in to really capture and one of them was France."",
  ""It was also the products of Jaramba and Holy Owly, which both have profitable unit economics."",
  ""And we have started to build organizations to really scale them and so on."",
  ""But now we decided, we will not focus as much on them."",
  ""And for instance, then we took the decision to restructure our French operations, which mainly work with growing on the French market and expanding the Holy Owly product."",
  ""So with this restructuring, we are now rightsizing that organization to more maintain the current business that we have there."",
  ""So we can free up resources and really focus on the areas, which are well performing and profitable today."",
  ""And that was it about operations for now."",
  ""So Katarina, please take us through the numbers."",
  ""So with Q3 behind us, obviously, we want to look forward."",
  ""And I'm going to just repeat a few things that for some of you who have followed us for a long time, we are on a four-step plan towards profitable growth, where the steps behind us were about growing a strong market position by both organically growing, but also acquiring companies."",
  ""And then during last year, we had a lot of focus on sort of structuring this one to lay a solid foundation for profitability and profitable growth, going forward."",
  ""And now we are in this step, where we have laser-focused on reaching profitability before we're next going to shift focus to more profitable growth."",
  ""But everything is fine-tuned here."",
  ""And we stay committed to the financial objectives that we have, which are to reach positive EBITDA in 2025 and to reach positive cash flow with existing cash in 2026, and then to reach double digit profitable growth."",
  ""Some of the things we are focusing on to really do this, and these are actually very much the same things as I talked about the last quarter."",
  ""In B2B, it's about continued to work on reducing churn."",
  ""I mean, in – for instance, Scotland, which is a super strong market for us, where we have some 80% penetration in the schools, it's about continue to make the products essential and loved by teachers and having a great customer success organization who support them, and also winning and growing in England."",
  ""We have had good progress there."",
  ""We are having good conversations and have landed many orders with big mutual academy trusts."",
  ""Now we're doing even more investments in the product, in marketing, in the partnership with YPO."",
  ""We talked about last quarter, which we really hope that will help us grow in England as well."",
  ""The sales in the US is continued to perform well and the sales model that we have over there is working fine, and we're now taking the next step in it."",
  ""So for next year, we are investing even more in marketing and customer success and so on to really scale that the US sales model that we have."",
  ""And also in terms of sales synergies, we are now focusing on the synergies between Sumdog and Strawbees especially on the UK market, where we have a really good relationship with many customers to whom we can now cross-sell the Sumdog product."",
  ""Looking on the B2C side, as I said before, we are now really focusing on Albert Junior since it's our best performing product there."",
  ""We have a really strong position in many markets and where we just try to sort of continuously optimize in how we acquire customers and retain the customers in a good way."",
  ""But we have now seen as I've been talking about a few times that I mean, customer acquisition is key to us as the product and churn and LTV is performing well."",
  ""So we are now having a lot of focus on how can we find scale, for instance, new markets achieving more opportunities."",
  ""So during this quarter, we launched in Romania, we plan to launch in the new market in the beginning of next year, and then at least one additional market next year as well."",
  ""So we can continue to find more customers at an attractive customer acquisition cost."",
  ""And then just in general, we continue on the track of really doubling down what's performing well and reallocating resources there and seeking cost synergies."",
  ""Then there are some upsides to the plan, which we're not building into the base plan, and that is, some of the business KPIs, which took a hit during the recession, would come back to like the pre-recession levels or that we would acquire profitable companies."",
  ""Those are just icing on the cake."",
  ""So to sum up the quarter and the takeaways, I would say, are these three."",
  ""It's been good momentum in invoiced sales in the quarter and it's up 11%, but we don't yet see it in the recognized revenues."",
  ""The big restructuring we did in Sweden, the Swedish operations in the first quarter, now start to show up in the result with lower staff cost."",
  ""And we did restructuring the French operations in this quarter, and that will have impact in 2025 and onwards."",
  ""And  to sort of the good momentum and that we have sort of cracked the sales model in both B2B and B2C marketing and sales, we have started to increase spend and investments in both those areas, which have added spending cost now in the third quarter, and for the rest of the year, but it will really pay off in the next year."",
  ""So we are happy with this quarter."",
  ""I think that operationally, things are going as planned and we're following the path to profitability."",
  ""But nowHello, and welcome to today's webcast with Albert, where CEO, Jonas Martensson; and CFO, Katarina Strivall, will present the report for the Third Quarter of 2024."",
  ""After the presentation, there will be a Q&A. So if you have any questions to Albert, you can send them in via the form to the right."",
  ""And with that said, I hand over the word to you guys."",
  ""As a part of our Q3 reporting, we have introduced a new KPI, invoiced sales, before we only reported net revenues, which recognized all long-term contracts over their full contract period."",
  ""This prioritization creates a significant delay, making it more difficult to see how sales perform in the reported quarter."",
  ""Invoiced sales as a new KPI is a more forward-looking indicator of our sales performance."",
  ""And together with the net revenue, it gives a clearer and more accurate picture of how the business is doing."",
  ""For the quarter, net revenue is 5% lower compared to the same quarter last year."",
  ""However, invoiced sales are up 11% quarter-over-quarter."",
  ""And the decrease in net revenue reflects the sales we had earlier this year."",
  ""If we look at the difference here between the net revenue and invoiced sales, we can clearly see the impact."",
  ""The lower sales earlier in the year are visible but what stands out is that all units showed strong sales growth in Q3."",
  ""Invoiced sales in Q3 are higher compared to the same period last year, and all sales in the end of the year is organic."",
  ""And if we look at this picture, we can see the different areas like B2C and B2B, the different products in our business model and our different markets."",
  ""And we can see that all the different segments are following the usual seasonal patterns actually."",
  ""And for example, like Strawbees has as a strong performance in Q2, and digital subscription in the business model dominates this quarter by B2C due to the strong Albert sales that Jonas mentioned before."",
  ""And going forward, EBITDA for the quarter is minus SEK 8 million and this lower EBITDA compared to last year comes from a different factors like lower sales in, for example, subscription sales earlier this year."",
  ""Also, as we talked about earlier in the presentation and it is also a portion of the strong sales we had this quarter is tied to subscriptions."",
  ""These are periodized and will contribute to revenue in the coming quarters."",
  ""And also, not all new customers have converted to paying costs linked to the good sales this quarter."",
  ""And we had particular high costs in marketing spend, as we have heard before here."",
  ""And we invested more in marketing during the quarter because we had a strong momentum and very good customer acquisition opportunities."",
  ""And also on the cost side, saving side, personnel costs have decreased as planned."",
  ""And that is  to the restructuring program we carried out in the first quarter this year."",
  ""Operating cash flow for the quarter was minus SEK 6 million, which represents an improvement compared to compared to last year."",
  ""And the main driver in these changes are in working capital, which contributed approximately with SEK 4.2 million to the improved cash flow this quarter."",
  ""And this came primarily from increased short-term liabilities, mostly from advanced invoicing for annual subscriptions in several of our entities."",
  ""And now we go back to Jonas.""
]","[
  ""And I actually think it's a combination of, let's call it, all the hard work that we have done in operations with how the macroeconomics is performing."",
  ""If I start with B2C, for instance, and I mentioned many of these things before."",
  ""So I will not go through everything, I mean, we had a very good start to 2023, when the customer acquisition costs were low and the volumes were high."",
  ""But since then, it has been quite challenging to attract new customers at the low cost."",
  ""Like throughout this, I mean, full period like churn of paying customers sustained very stable during the entire recession period."",
  ""And based on our research, it has been that customers really see the value in it."",
  ""They think it's very easy to motivate to spend money on learning products for the children."",
  ""But winning and converting the new ones a bit hard."",
  ""But this summer then really things started to change."",
  ""As I said before, I mean, customer acquisition cost has been very low and volume is very high, something we beat last year a lot and also the previous year."",
  ""And this sort of year-over-year improvements have continued also now in the fall."",
  ""The fall is not as good as the summer, it never is."",
  ""But compared to the previous years, it's much better this year as well."",
  ""So I think it's an indication that things are getting better in B2C. I think we can also see it in like our churn results when customers churn for some during the recession period, like the reason that price or I can't afford a product like this was increasing, but now that KPI or reason has decreased during the last months."",
  ""So maybe it's an indication that the economics is turning."",
  ""On the B2B side, I mentioned before as well, I mean, we had a lot of changes to the products that really improve them and tailor them for the different markets, where we are playing."",
  ""I think we've also learned and improved the whole commercial organization, with how we work with marketing in the best way to really ensure we get hot leads for the business development functions or the sales functions to really win those customers."",
  ""And especially then how we work with customer success to really ensure we very early on help the customers in B2B, to get onboarded in the products, to see the full value of them, to use them, because if they are using them, it's a much easier decision to stay later on when it's time to renew."",
  ""And we have also focused a lot about instead of selling to into individual schools and try to win bigger deals with municipalities, local authorities or mutual academic trusts, and with those ones, it's also been much lower churn."",
  ""So yeah, actually, I'll stay there."",
  ""I think – and let's go for the next question, Ludwig."",
  ""I mean, we started 2024 with, as I said before, like launching this profitability program, where we have a number of activities, which we really knew that we wanted to take."",
  ""We had to take like rightsizing the Swedish operations and so on."",
  ""But then we also had some ideas, which we needed to investigate a little bit more, and that was the reason why we did this big strategic review during the summer."",
  ""And now we have really identified the areas that were performing well and that we want to focus on and also identify the areas that's sort of where we have to reduce cost and rightsize to enable the shift of resources to the well performing areas."",
  ""So that review is done, and we have – which also meant we had to take some actions like restructuring the French operations."",
  ""So now when we work with the business plans for 2025, in particular, on the budget for that one and also the plans for 2026 is like, we have very solid plans to see."",
  ""I mean, what we should do on the revenue side and on the cost side, achieve these things."",
  ""So I think with the things that are in our control, I mean, we are very confident."",
  ""Then of course, we can never know really what's happening in the world around us."",
  ""If we will have a lot of headwind, it would be more challenging."",
  ""It will have a lot of tailwind."",
  ""It will get even better, but if we see there will be some wins in both directions, it could – it should definitely work."",
  ""In B2B, it's very similar, like it has always been, the way we always sell like one or multi-year subscriptions."",
  ""In B2C, yes, that's correct."",
  ""I mean, we have over the last probably 1.5 years focused on trying to achieve higher share of annual subscriptions, because we have better lifetime value or LTV on those customers."",
  ""So in quarter three, we had a good quarter of annual subscriptions."",
  ""It's not any like significant difference to the previous quarters and years, but it's up a bit."",
  ""I mean, what the number you mentioned, they are correct."",
  ""And no, we are not."",
  ""I mean, we feel, we are done with a strategic review."",
  ""We have really gone into every nitty-gritty detail, and now it feels like all our organizations are rightsized and we are having good profit, unit economics, we are profitable on the brand level."",
  ""So now it's really about scaling and doing more of what's working well."",
  ""So no more restructurings like that planned."",
  ""I mean, to some extent, we want to find synergies, but we also really need to optimize each business individually."",
  ""But to mention a few things, and I mean, the next steps, as I mentioned, I think last quarter, we really launched our internal product with So that's something we are – we think that model will really work for us."",
  ""So now we are training some of the people in our UK sales team in the sort of the sales and marketing on the Strawbees product."",
  ""We're also sort of – if we took in, for instance, the marketing organization thinking because there are a lot of expertise sits and sort of how do I talk to the customers on a specific market?"",
  ""So the team in the UK will have more focus on the UK market for both products and the team working more with the US will have more focus on the US market and the team focused on the Nordics will have more focus there."",
  ""So it's about sort of combining that – I mean, I really work with one product, but also having much focus on the market, where you are sort of the expert."",
  ""And then some of the things like in just harmonizing how we work with best practices in terms of processes and tools and KPIs and sales training, and those type of things are being done as well."",
  "" so much from us as well."",
  "" for calling in, and enjoy the weekend."",
  ""I can take that one."",
  ""It is mainly due to lower sales and higher marketing spends and in the lower sales, as I mentioned before, we had lower sales earlier in the year and we have a strong sales in this quarter, but we haven't seen the full impact of the strong sales from this yet."",
  ""And this is because part of the sales is related to periodized revenue, and with the – which will generate income in the future quarters, and also we invested more in marketing during the quarter, and the full cost is recognized immediately, but some other revenue will come later on."",
  ""That was all the questions we had for today."",
  ""So  so much for presenting here, and  all for tuning in and have a great weekend.""

  ""First, let me remind you that the reported results are impacted by the consolidation of Mac Baren, the smoking tobacco company we acquired with effect from 1st of July, and we've now updated the financial guidance for the full year to include the impacts from Mac Baren."",
  ""Reported net sales increased by 7.1%, with organic net sales growth being slightly negative at 0.1%, EBITDA margin decreased, as we expected, compared with a strong third quarter of last year."",
  ""EBITDA margin in the third quarter was 23.4%."",
  ""For the first nine months of the year, the reported net sales growth was 4.5%, and EBITDA margin was 22.0%."",
  ""Free cash flow before acquisitions was 275 million in the third quarter and 327 million for the nine-month period."",
  ""In terms of highlights for the quarter, I would like to mention that the performance of Machine-Rolled Cigars have improved as a result of our investments in retaining market shares."",
  ""Our nicotine brand ex-US continues to grow high double digit rates, and the distribution of third party NGP products in the US will be discontinued."",
  ""Finally, the integration plan of Mac Baren has been completed, and we've now communicated the expected financial benefits of the integration."",
  ""And in September we issued a new €300 million corporate bond."",
  ""Compared to our original guidance, which we repeated in August, the financial performance year-to-date support these expectations."",
  ""So, we are likely to end in the lower end of the ranges due to the discontinuation of the third party distribution of nicotine pouches in the US and the difficult market conditions for Handmade Cigars in the US where we continue to see weak demand."",
  ""Marianne will give more details on the financial details in a moment."",
  ""I will now give you an update on the progress we're making with our strategy."",
  ""Please turn to slide number 6."",
  ""We continue to make good progress with our strategy rolling towards 2025 and let me give you a few highlights on the recent achievements."",
  ""Acquisitions are an important part of our mission to become a larger and more profitable company and at the same time keep financial discipline to make sure we can also deliver long-term value for our shareholders."",
  ""The acquisition of Mac Baren meets all these criteria."",
  ""It improves our positions within smoking, tobacco and nicotine pouches, and will, when fully integrated, deliver significant value to our shareholders."",
  ""I will get back to Mac Baren and the financial implications of the transaction in a moment."",
  ""In August, we talked about the importance of being ahead of the market dynamics and establishing an agile cost structure."",
  ""The creation of one commercial organization with a stronger focus on our core product categories, and the aim of getting closer to our consumers and customers is one example of this."",
  ""And the action to implement additional adjustments to our cost structure across the group is another."",
  ""We will maintain this focus going forward, but at the same time, it remains important for us to make the necessary investments to support the long-term health of our company."",
  ""The investments in our growth enablers are examples just as the investments we have made in recovering our market shares in Machine-Rolled Cigars in Europe."",
  ""It might have an impact on near-term profit margins, but we are convinced that these investments will support our vision and financial ambitions over time."",
  ""Our growth enablers continue to deliver good performance with our Next Generation Products, our US retail stores, and our international sales of Handmade Cigars, all delivering solid growth."",
  ""Regis will talk more about these achievements in a moment and the growth enablers share of group net sales decline to 9% in the third quarter, which is lower compared with the first half of the year."",
  ""However, this decline is entirely explained by the discontinuation of distribution of third party products in the US."",
  ""During the third quarter, we issued a €300 million corporate bond, securing our long-term financing, and Marianne will give you more details about this in a second."",
  ""Please turn to slide number 7."",
  ""I will now turn the focus to the integration of Mac Baren and the expected financial impacts of the acquisition."",
  ""We have completed the planning on how to integrate Mac Baren into tobacco – sorry into Scandinavian Tobacco Group and we are now – and we now have a better understanding of the benefits this combination will create."",
  ""The detailed planning process have confirmed that the investment of DKK 535 million will create good value for our shareholders, and we are convinced that the combination of our businesses will secure a strong and attractive portfolio of brands and products to the benefit of our consumers and customers."",
  ""When integrated, we expect synergies in the level of DKK 150 million with full impact in 2027."",
  ""The main cost synergies will be within sales and marketing, head office functions, and the combination of our manufacturing footprint."",
  ""Last week, we announced that Mac Baren's production sites in the Sutliff, the US and in Svendborg, Denmark will be closed down over the coming years."",
  ""Special cash costs are expected in the level of DKK 150 million, primarily expensed in 2025 and 2026, and we expect to have capital expenditures to the level of DKK 125 million, primarily in relation to the transfer of production to our existing sites."",
  ""For 2024, we expect Mac Baren to add about DKK 300 million in net sales with a slightly negative impact to the group's financials whereas both synergies and special costs would be immaterial."",
  ""With this, I'll leave the word to Regis, please turn two slides to slide number 9."",
  ""I will now give you more details on the full year outlook."",
  ""The full year, 2024 expectations have been updated to include the financial impact from Mac Baren, which was consolidated from 1st of July 2024."",
  ""Excluding Mac Baren, the expectations remained within the original guidance range as communicated in August 2024, though more likely in the lower end of the ranges given the absence of the third party distribution of nicotine pouches, we have mentioned as well as the continued weaker market for cigars."",
  ""Currently, the market for Handmade Cigars in the US is estimated to contract by a mid-single digit percentage, and there are no clear signs of when the decline rate will stabilize at a lower decline rate."",
  ""US consumer spending remains cautious and we are also seeing down trading."",
  ""For the online business we continue to deliver low single digit growth whilst both our retail stores and our international markets deliver higher growth and we expect organic net sales of Handmade Cigars to increase compared to the last year."",
  ""The total market for Machine-Rolled Cigars in key markets in Europe has recently delivered improving volume decline rates compared with the first half of the year, and the initiatives to regain market shares have also started to have an impact."",
  ""We expect organic net sales of Machine-Rolled Cigars to decline compared to last year."",
  ""We expect net sales from our own Next Generation Product brands to continue with the current momentum and to increase versus last year by more than 50% for the full year, driven by market share expansion and roll out to new markets."",
  ""The nicotine pouch business for Mac Baren will add to the reported growth, while the organic growth rate for the product categories also in the fourth quarter will be negatively impacted by the discontinuation of the third-party distribution of nicotine pouches in the US."",
  ""Based on the expectations for our different product categories, group reported net sales are expected in the level of DKK 9.1 billion."",
  ""The EBITDA margin before special items is expected in the range of 22% to 23% and compared with last year, the margin is being diluted by increased investments in both nicotine pouches and in the Machine-Rolled Cigars, the expansion of our retail network in the US as well as product and market mix changes, including the impact on Mac Baren."",
  ""These factors are partly being offset by price increases, continued cost optimizations, and the expected refund of certain import tax payments."",
  ""The largest uncertainties for net sales and the EBITDA margins remained changes in consumer behavior as well as market and product mix."",
  ""Free cash flow is expected in the range of DKK 0.8 billion to DKK 0.9 billion and as we have communicated before, will be impacted by the special investments of up to DKK 300 million."",
  ""An improvement in the working capital during the fourth quarter is expected to support a strong cash flow towards the end of the year and the expectations of delivering more than DKK 800 million for the full year."",
  ""Looking at adjusted earnings per share it is expected in the level of DKK 12.5, including an estimated impact from the current share repurchase program of DKK 0.7 to DKK 0.8."",
  ""Now this concludes our presentation for today's call."",
  ""I will now hand the word back to the operator and we are ready to take questions."",
  ""Welcome to our webcast for the Third Quarter Results 2024."",
  ""My name is Torben Sand, and I am Director of Investor Relations and Group Communications."",
  ""And I am, today, joined by our CEO, Niels Frederiksen; our CFO, Marianne Rørslev Bock; and our Chief Commercial Officer, Regis Broersma."",
  ""Now, please turn to slide number 3 for the agenda for today's webcast."",
  ""Niels will start by introducing, sorry, Niels will introduce by giving an overview of the key highlights of the third quarter, as well as an update on our strategy and other key events, including the financial impacts from the acquisition of Mac Baren."",
  ""Regis will follow and give you an update on key developments in our core markets, as well as insights to recent trends and developments in our product categories."",
  ""Marianne takes over an overview of the financial performance in our three reporting divisions, where after she will turn the focus to key financial developments for the group, including an update on cash flow leverage and capital allocations."",
  ""Niels will conclude the presentation with an update on our expectations for 2024."",
  ""After the presentation by management, we will, as usual, conduct a Q&A session where we will be pleased to take any questions you might have."",
  ""And before we start, I ask you, as always, to pay special attention to our disclaimer and forward-looking statements at the end of this presentation."",
  ""Please now turn to slide 5 and I'll the word to Niels."",
  "", Niels, and a very good day to everyone on the call."",
  ""My name is Regis Broersma and I'm the Chief Commercial Officer at Scandinavian Tobacco Group."",
  ""In the previous webcast in August, I explained about the implementation of a new commercial structure and how the new structure is to enhance and strengthen our capabilities to deliver the best brands, and the best customer, and consumer service going forward."",
  ""And as an introduction remark, I am pleased with the progress and results we have achieved so far."",
  ""So, let me now spend a moment on updating you on the most recent performance measured by our product categories."",
  ""The category Handmade Cigars, which includes handmade cigars sold via online platforms, via our retail stores, and via sales of our brands to external retailers and distributors in the US, as well as our sales to markets outside of the US."",
  ""This category delivered a reported as well as an organic net sales decline of 1% in the third quarter."",
  ""Handmade Cigars account for 36% of group net sales."",
  ""Machine-Rolled Cigars and Smoking Tobacco, which also includes pipe tobacco and fine-cut."",
  ""This category continued to improve during the quarter and delivered a 3% organic net sales growth."",
  ""Reported growth was 15% impacted by the consolidation of Mac Baren into STG."",
  ""The category contributed 50% of group net sales in the third quarter."",
  ""Next Generation Products delivered 2% organic net sales growth of 72% reported growth."",
  ""This continuation of the distribution of third party products in the US, which we mentioned at the second quarter reporting had a severe impact on organic growth."",
  ""The category contributed with 4% of group net sales in the third quarter."",
  ""The group Other includes sales of accessories, third-party contract manufacturing, and bar sales in our retail stores."",
  ""This group declined 11% organically, primarily as a result of lower accessory sales in Australia."",
  ""Now please turn to slide number 10, where I will give more details to the category performance."",
  ""Handmade Cigars, so, currently consumption of Handmade Cigars in the US continues to contract with an estimated mid-single digit percentage."",
  ""We remain confident that the decline rate will stabilize at a lower level, but at this point, we see no sign of this happening anytime soon."",
  ""Consumer behavior and consumer spending in America remains an issue of uncertainty and currently our base case scenario is that we will not experience an improvement in the next quarters ahead of us."",
  ""Currently, we see more value for money demand in the market, and with a higher promotional activity, overall price mix impact in the market remains under pressure."",
  ""For our Handmade Cigars category, organic net sales declined by 1% in the third quarter as I just mentioned."",
  ""The declining total consumption in the important US market mostly impacts our sales to US distributors and retailers, which currently experienced a high single digit volume decline rate."",
  ""However, our strategy to invest in growth opportunities across the category does deliver valuable contributions to the overall performance of the category."",
  ""International sales of Handmade Cigars continues to deliver some growth, and our retail cigar stores in the US delivered 14% growth compared with last year."",
  ""Part of the growth stems from the opening of new stores."",
  ""But same store sales also improve strongly by an 11% increase."",
  ""During the quarter, we opened one new store in Tennessee and two more openings are taking place in the fourth quarter, bringing our total to 12 superstores by the end of 2024."",
  ""Growth in our online business is driven by an increase in spend per consumer, compensating for a slightly declining active consumer base Please turn one slide, to slide number 11."",
  ""Machine-Rolled Cigars and Smoking Tobacco."",
  ""So for Machine-Rolled Cigars the total market decline improved somewhat during the third quarter, the decline rate is estimated at 1.4% compared with about 5% lower volumes in the beginning of the year."",
  ""Consequently, acceleration in volume declines in Europe has eased off, although it remains uncertain when this is – if this is only temporary or sustainable improvements."",
  ""In the coming quarters we will provide important data points in this respect."",
  ""During the third quarter, our Machine-Rolled Cigars business in Europe did improve its performance compared with the development in the first half of the year, partly due to the improvement in total market declines, and partly, as we have started to recover market shares."",
  ""The initiatives and investments we have taken and are taking to rebuild our market positions have still not reached full effect that will take time, but an improvement in our market share With this, now turn to the next slide."",
  ""Next Generation Products during the third quarter, the category increased net sales by 72% reported compared to the third quarter last year, with an organic growth being positive by 2%."",
  ""Behind these numbers, there are a number of important factors to be aware of."",
  ""Firstly, our nicotine brand XQS, which we acquired last year, continues to impress with high organic growth rates."",
  ""The third quarter growth was 72%, driven by market share growth in Sweden."",
  ""We are now close to 8% and the launch of the brand in UK, and also in Denmark."",
  ""Although it's too early to evaluate the success of the launch in Denmark, the XQS brand has gained traction in the UK, and a stake in market share since the launch more than five months ago."",
  ""Secondly, the distribution of the third-party nicotine product in the US with our online business has been discontinued."",
  ""We've communicated on this back in August and has now become clear the distribution will not be With this, I will now leave the word to Marianne for more details on the divisional performance."",
  ""Please turn to slide number 14."",
  ""We will now turn the focus to more details to the financial data, which we disclosed on the three reporting commercial divisions."",
  ""I will start with the overview – I will start the overview with Europe Branded."",
  ""Reported net sales for the third quarter increased by 19% to DKK 850 million, organic net sales increasing by 6%."",
  ""The acquisition of Mac Baren impacted reported net sales by 12%."",
  ""The main drivers for the organic growth are increasing net sales of Handmade Cigars, Next Generation Products, as well as Smoking Tobacco, while at the same time the decline rate in the net sales of Machine-Rolled Cigars improved compared to the decline in the second quarter as Regis just talked to."",
  ""Next Generation Products and Handmade Cigars delivered double-digit net sales growth and are part of our growth enablers."",
  ""Pricing remains a key factor in all core categories, and the execution of pricing might be more tactical in certain product categories to protect or improve our market share positions."",
  ""In Machine-Rolled Cigars, we are finding a bit of balance, enabling us to improve both volume and value share in the market."",
  ""EBITDA before special items increased by DKK 24 million to DKK 200 million when EBITDA margin of 23.6% versus 24.6% in the same quarter last year."",
  ""The margin development was primarily driven by the continued investments in NGP category to support long-term growth, as well as the impact of the financial consolidation of Mac Baren."",
  ""With this, please turn to slide number 15, where I will speak to North America Branded & Rest of the World."",
  ""In the quarter reported net sales for the commercial division North America Branded & Rest of the World increased by 4% to DKK 837 million."",
  ""Organic net sales were negative by 5%."",
  ""The main drivers for the organic development were a negative volume impact from lower shipments of Machine-Rolled Cigars to the region Middle East Africa, a continued decline in net sales of Handmade Cigars to wholesalers as well as lower contract manufacturing sales."",
  ""EBITDA before special items decreased by DKK 24 million to DKK 297 million will make their margin of 35.5% versus 39.7% in the third quarter last year, which was an exceptionally strong quarter for the division."",
  ""The margin was also impacted by lower margins in the Mac Baren business."",
  ""I will now turn the attention to financial performance in our North America Online and Retail division."",
  ""Please turn to slide number 16."",
  ""Reported net sales for the third quarter decreased marginally by 0.2 percentage point to DKK 743 million, with negative organic net sales growth at 1%."",
  ""Mac Baren added 1.5% to the reported net sales."",
  ""The development in organic net sales is driven by positive contribution from new store openings in the retail business, an 11% increase in the same-store sales, as well as low single-digit growth in our online business."",
  ""This though, is being offset by the discontinuation of third-party distribution, which both Niels and Regis have mentioned."",
  ""The distribution was stopped by the end of the second quarter this year, which implies growth from the Online & Retail division will continue to be impacted in the next three quarters."",
  ""EBITDA before special items decreased by DKK 26 million to DKK 103 million, with the EBITDA margin decreasing from – decreasing to 13.9% from 17.4% in the third quarter last year."",
  ""The decrease is driven by the net sales impact from the distribution of third-party products, a comparison to a strong quarter last year, as well as the inclusion of Mac Baren business."",
  ""Please turn to slide number 17."",
  ""In the previous section, I talked to the financial performance by division, but let me add a few comments to selected items in the group results."",
  ""Reported net sales increased by 7% to DKK 2.4 billion."",
  ""The impact from the acquisition of Mac Baren was also 7%, and as the impact from exchange rate developments was immaterial in the quarter, the organic net sales growth was almost flat or minus 0.1%."",
  ""However, if we take a closer look at the underlying organic net sales growth, it was impacted by 1% from the discontinuation of the third party product distribution and by 0.7% from an organic decline in the Mac Baren business."",
  ""Excluding these components, the underlying organic growth was positive by 1.6%."",
  ""This could give you hopefully a better sense of the underlying development in the business."",
  ""Special cost was DKK 49 million in the quarter relating primarily to the implementation of the ERP system and the implementation of the new organizational structure."",
  ""Net profit for the quarter was DKK 297 million compared to DKK 351 million in the third quarter last year, with the decline being driven by the lower EBITDA and higher special costs."",
  ""The adjusted earnings per share were unchanged at DKK 4.1."",
  ""The free cash flow before acquisitions was positive by DKK 275 million compared with DKK 622 million last year."",
  ""The development was primarily impacted by the operational performance, a slightly negative impact from changes in working capital this quarter, compared with a DKK 303 million positive impact in the third quarter last year."",
  ""We expect the working capital development in the fourth quarter will deliver solid contribution to free cash flow supporting our guidance of free cash flow before acquisition of more than DKK 800 million for the full year."",
  ""Please turn to slide number 18."",
  ""In this slide, we show the performance by key performance indicators for the group."",
  ""We have talked in detail to the organic net sales growth."",
  ""So I will focus on the margin development."",
  ""The EBITDA margin decreased from 26.5% in the third quarter of last year to 23.4% in the third quarter of this year."",
  ""The lower margin is driven by the inclusion of Mac Baren as well as investments in the support and growth of our NGP brand XQS, and to recover market shares in Machine-Rolled Cigars in Europe."",
  ""Further, the comparison was up against the strong quarter last year, where all three commercial divisions delivered the best margins in the year."",
  ""These dynamics are partly reflected in the gross margin, which decreases by almost 2 percentage point to 46.3%, and partly in our OpEx ratio."",
  ""Now please turn one slide, to slide number 19."",
  ""I will now turn to an update on our net debt and leverage position, the issuance of a new corporate bond in September, and the status on the current share buyback program, which was initiated in November last year."",
  ""During the third quarter, the net interest bank debt increased by DKK 0.5 billion to DKK 5.8 billion as a result of cash flow from operations, capital allocations comprising the repurchase of own shares at a value of DKK 217 million, as well as the acquisition of Mac Baren at a value of DKK 535 million."",
  ""By the end of last week the holding of own shares was close to 8%, and I do believe that it is likely that we can complete the DKK 850 million program within a few weeks from now."",
  ""The leverage ratio increased to 2.9 times."",
  ""It was 1.9 times at the end of 2023."",
  ""However, the leverage is impacted by the acquisition of Mac Baren."",
  ""By the end of 2024, we expect the leverage ratio to decline to the level of 2.7 times being a strong – driven by strong cash flow in the fourth quarter."",
  ""As the calculation of the leverage ratio includes the total transaction value of Mac Baren of DKK 535 million with only financial results for the second half of 2024, the reported leverage ratio for Q3 and by the end of the year was technically be too high."",
  ""Combined with our structurally strong cash flow generation, I expect the leverage ratio to decline further next year, leaving room for delivering on our capital return policy."",
  ""Finally in September, we issued a new €300 million corporate bond with a coupon interest rate at 4.875% will maturity in September 2029."",
  ""Simultaneously, we have repurchased almost €187 million of the existing €300 million bond facility, with a coupon of 1.375% issued in September 2020 and which expires next year."",
  ""Hence, the higher interest rate on part of our funding is to be reflected in future financial costs."",
  ""Please turn to slide number 20."",
  ""Our shareholder return policy is anchored in delivering an annual growth in ordinary dividend per share and to distribute any excess capital."",
  ""Year to date, in 2024, we have now returned more than DKK 1.5 billion and at the end of the third quarter we were close to DKK 1.4 billion at the current share price we have returned close to 19% STG's current market value."",
  ""These achievements underline our commitment to deliver on our shareholder return policy."",
  ""With this, I will now leave the word back to Niels for an update on our updated guidance for 2024."",
  ""Please turn two slides to slide number 22.""
]","[
  ""Yes, a couple of questions from my end."",
  ""Firstly, on US Handmade Cigars."",
  ""You mentioned here that you expect the trend to continue to be weak for some time."",
  ""What do you attribute the main reasons for this?"",
  ""Is this mainly due to cyclicality?"",
  ""How is your market share developing?"",
  ""Are you losing market share because you talked about down trading?"",
  ""And also, how are your volumes now organically compared to pre-COVID levels or rather look at organic sales, how are your organic sales relative to pre-COVID levels now for US or North American Handmade Cigars?"",
  "" for answering all those questions."",
  ""A second question here also on the absence of your distribution business here for nicotine pouches in the US, I think we're talking about zyn.com."",
  ""What exactly was the impact here for North America Online?"",
  ""I think you talked about around 1 percentage point for the group."",
  ""But what was the impact for North America Online?"",
  ""And you say this will continue for the coming quarters."",
  ""Are there any plans or possibilities to relaunch zyn.com or is that a lost business?"",
  ""And can you tell us all about Mac Baren's Next Generation Product?"",
  ""How are they positioned and are they seeing growth rates anywhere near what you're seeing in ex-US at the moment."",
  ""And sorry, which markets are those in particular where they're very strong?"",
  ""And finally, just some details here."",
  ""I notice a pretty sharp rise in both depreciation and obviously interest expenses here due to the new financing, and also amortization."",
  ""They're all up quite a bit sequentially, particularly, the first two."",
  ""The Q3 rate here is that the best estimate for what we should see going forward?"",
  ""I mean, did depreciation of close to DKK 70 million, amortization of close to DKK 50 million, and financial expenses in the range of DKK 80 million."",
  ""Is that what you see going forward or are there exceptionals here in Q3?"",
  ""Those were all my questions."",
  "" for taking my questions as well here."",
  ""So first, I want to follow-up on sort of the M&A acquisition going forward."",
  ""So again, congrats on the Mac Baren acquisition."",
  ""I mean, with DKK 150 million synergies, the deal looks to be a strong value add to the business going forward."",
  ""Now you have pursued a few different, sort of, M&A tracks over the past years."",
  ""You have pursued M&A within Next Generation Product, you have built Handmade Cigars portfolio."",
  ""And then you have, I mean, quite stuff like Mac Baren or Agio, which, at least, on the surface, looks like, I mean, more synergy cases compared to the other two."",
  ""Now, what sort of acquisition track are you aiming for going forward?"",
  ""That will be my first question."",
  ""Yeah, , Neils, obviously, I get that."",
  ""But what are sort of the pecking order here?"",
  ""So what would you prefer?"",
  ""Would you prefer growth over synergy cases or is that not able – you're not able to look at it that way or... Okay."",
  ""And then, I mean, in light of the, sort of, continued volume declines, you see, does this in any way, sort of, change your view on capital allocation?"",
  ""I mean, given that a lot of, I mean, you're a production company, a lot of profitability is based on the fact that you were able to retain some, sort of, volume."",
  ""So, would you see, like, are you more tilted towards pursuing M&A, thereby gaining volumes than you were, sort of, a few years ago now or in light of the current market situation?"",
  ""Or is that a way to think of it?"",
  ""Then, to summarize the Mac Baren integration, here you talk about combining the NGP portfolios."",
  ""How about, sort of, utilizing or yeah, utilizing the Mac Baren NGP production capabilities."",
  ""Is that something you look into, sort of, gaining your own production footprint within NGP products?"",
  ""And then, just last question on the special item line, so clearly boosted by ERP, new commercial structure, and then also now the Mac Baren integration."",
  ""Could you just remind us what should we think of sort of this line in 2025, 2026, can you add some color to this?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""First question is about US Handmade Cigars."",
  ""And I, sort of, hear what you're saying about the, sort of, expectations for Q4."",
  ""But I was just wondering what plans or how you were thinking about the potential impact on tariffs."",
  ""And in particular, whether that's likely to accelerate down trading in the category in the US will be my first question."",
  ""Second question would be on free cash flow, and it looks like you've got to deliver about DKK 0.5 billion in the fourth quarter."",
  ""Just could you give us a bit more comfort around the moving parts around that to give us confidence and you're hitting the guidance?"",
  ""And then just finally on the Next Generation Product, are you able to sort of quantify how much you're spending on marketing of those products and then whether there are any sort of differences in terms of moisture content between XQS and sort of Ace and Gritt brands that you acquired with Mac Baren, please."",
  ""Can I also just ask to be added to the email that you're going to send to Niklas on depreciation, amortization and interest costs, please."",
  ""So we see different parts of our value chain, of course, performing differently."",
  ""We have the retail stores performing very well, and are actually in growth, and also net sales growth same-stores are plus 11%."",
  ""And we debated also why that is, for example, and we believe that also is very much because going to CI superstore is also an experience, and we see that the consumer spending in the US that the consumers at the moment are more into experience spending than it's necessarily about buying more products."",
  ""Also, we see a shift in channel where we also see that the online channel is actually performing, and it is really the business-to-business side where we have lost volumes."",
  ""Then what was more the question...?"",
  ""So I believe here also when you compare the volumes, we are probably slightly below the levels that we were pre-COVID."",
  ""This has also been part of that."",
  ""We have reached over the last five years Yeah, and then coming back to question about the market share?"",
  ""Of course, the data is very limited on Handmade Cigars in the US we have a little bit more detail on the online share compared to our online competitors, and there, we see that our increased promo spend is working, and also our market share is slightly up in the online channel."",
  ""Business-to-business, we don't really have market share data."",
  ""And there – but we expect that we are in line with the market."",
  ""So part, of course, the integration is that we combine the portfolios, and we do see a future role for the two brands that Mac Baren has, which is Ace and Gritt."",
  ""And they have quite strong market shares in markets where we are not really present yet."",
  ""So it actually complements, and yeah, we do see a future here ex-US will be our global drive brand, and then Ace and Gritt will be positioned in certain pockets of growth."",
  ""Principally, they have – they're already in Denmark where they had about at least 6% market share."",
  ""And then in Iceland, in the Baltics, and then some other export markets also."",
  ""I think that we do think about acquisitions exactly from the two perspectives."",
  ""There are some types of acquisitions like Mac Baren, but also like Agio, which, on the one hand, strengthens our brand portfolio, which is important."",
  ""But also, deliver a significant synergy case, and those, we would obviously like to do more."",
  ""And it's really a question about when to – potential targets are willing to divest or and maybe we don't know whether we ever come to that, but that is one path that we continue to follow."",
  ""Then there are other acquisitions like I think that the easiest acquisitions for us to make are always the synergy driven cases."",
  ""These are typically with less risk, and they are also faster to, let's say, to turnaround for value creation."",
  ""The strategic acquisitions, we still believe are important coming back to the need to globalize, for example, our Handmade Cigars business more."",
  ""And we should be making them."",
  ""But we are also conscious that that they are more difficult to assess, both for ourselves and also for investors."",
  ""I think it is a way to think about it."",
  ""And there's no doubt that that with declining volumes, consolidation becomes even more important."",
  ""But I also think it's an area where everyone needs to be patient."",
  ""These acquisitions, come up when they come up."",
  ""And we certainly have a priority to build a factory footprint that is, of course, benefiting from increased volume."",
  ""But there's also an element of creating a certain scalability, because we know that when we don't acquire volumes will most likely go down and we need to be able to cope with that as well."",
  ""So indeed with the Mac Baren acquisition came the manufacturing facility in Svendborg2019 levels."",
  ""Niklas, we do not believe that Philip Morris will resume the sale of zyn online, and that goes for all online businesses in the US, not only our online business."",
  ""And numbers wise, we had previously given percentages, but numbers wise it is what we have sold for the – it's around DKK 130 million that we have in zyn this year."",
  ""So Niklas, I would say, let me come back to you with that question when we look forward on those."",
  ""I'll reach out directly to you."",
  ""And to add here, if market volumes are going down, it is not only impacting STG, but it is also impacting our competitors."",
  ""And let me add here, when we talk synergies from Mac Baren in the level of DKK 150 million, that is excluding any potential future synergies or in-sourcing of own production to STG simply because we don't have a clear plan yet."",
  ""So, we will fill in 2025, see some additional costs from our ERP implementation, which we believe that we have finished globally in the first half year of 2026."",
  ""And then, of course, the – as you also mentioned, the Mac Baren, we will when we come with our guidance for 2024 – or 2025 we will put more timing on the various synergies and costs."",
  ""But we can say that on the synergy side the majority part of those would be realized in 2025 and 2026, and the majority of the special cost will come in 2025."",
  ""We do not have significant other special items lined out for now."",
  ""So let me start out, and then, Niels and Regis can supplement."",
  ""On tariffs, it's a damn good question."",
  ""I think it is too early for us."",
  ""We are looking into it, but it is too early for us to say something educated about it."",
  ""We are looking at production in our Central America."",
  ""Well, that would impact and other imports into US."",
  ""We do not have any more production in the US when we have closed down the plant of Mac Baren On the cash flow for the fourth quarter, you're absolutely right."",
  ""We have to deliver more than DKK 0.5 billion in cash flow for the fourth quarter."",
  ""Fourth quarter is normally also a strong cash flow generating quarter for us."",
  ""We were just slightly below DKK 0.5 billion last year, and then the main components here are a positive impact from working capital."",
  ""But then we are also seeing less tax payments than we saw last year."",
  ""So we are confident that we can deliver the DKK 0.5 billion in cash flow."",
  ""On the NGP, Regis will supplement in a moment."",
  ""But what we have said on the NGP and investment, we are not splitting it out in numbers on the sales and marketing, but the net investment that we are seeing for 2024 is about DKK 25 million."",
  ""So that is if you isolate the European NGP business, then the bottom line is around minus 25%."",
  ""And then maybe, Regis, can put some color on what we're seeing Yeah."",
  ""So I think also with the question about the product of Ace and Gritt from Mac Baren, Ace is actually product and recipe wise quite similar to XQS."",
  ""The great thing from Absolutely."",
  ""And actually, there is one question I think we have asked or answered it already, but let me just read it out anyways."",
  ""If we expect any effect from increased tariffs in the US and do we have own production in the US, I think Marianne already talked to this in the previous question."",
  ""Aside from that, we don't have any further questions in the webinar."",
  "" all for listening in."",
  ""And we will be back with our full year report in March."",
  ""So have a great day.""

  ""This was an excellent year for NJR, driven by strong financial performance across all of our business segments."",
  ""In addition, we successfully completed a number of pending items, most notably the successful resolution of NJNG's base rate case and energy efficiency programs."",
  ""This provides greater certainty, as we enter fiscal 2025, which along with strategic investments throughout our businesses, leaves NJR positioned for success well into the future."",
  ""In fiscal 2024, we exceeded the high end of the NFEPS guidance range that we raised earlier this year."",
  ""This is our fourth consecutive year of surpassing initial guidance, demonstrating the strength of our diversified business model and our ability to deliver shareholder value."",
  ""We have an industry leading stated NFEPS long term growth rate of 7% to 9%, and more importantly, our actual performance consistently exceeds that target."",
  ""At New Jersey Natural Gas, we grew our customer base and reported a record level of energy efficiency investments through our SAVEGREEN program."",
  ""Clean Energy Ventures commissioned our first community solar project, built on a capped landfill in New Jersey, which will provide clean energy to low and moderate income customers."",
  ""It was a busy year for CEV, with nearly 70 megawatts of projects either placed in service or under construction."",
  ""S&T continued to drive organic growth with Leaf River completing a booster compression project and initiating a new capacity recovery project."",
  ""These will contribute to higher revenues over time through the enhanced storage services and operational efficiency."",
  ""Energy Services benefited from an outsized contribution from the Asset Management Agreements announced in 2020, while delivering significant value from this long option strategy during the January weather event."",
  ""And finally, our Home Services division completed approximately 80,000 service calls with a near 5 Star Google rating and was recognized as a Ruud Top 20 Pro Partner for the eighth consecutive year."",
  ""Overall, this is a great year with many accomplishments from our team."",
  ""As we look ahead, NJR is well positioned for future growth, as we outlined on slide 5."",
  ""The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities approved a settlement to New Jersey Natural Gas' base rate case last week, securing recovery for investments that ensure safe and reliable service for our roughly 583,000 customers."",
  ""Roberto will go through the details shortly, but overall, we were very pleased to reach a fair and equitable resolution with all parties."",
  ""I want to thank the Board of Public Utilities and their staff and the Division of Rate Counsel for their hard work."",
  ""We have a constructive working relationship with them that ensures the interests of both customers and shareholders are fairly balanced."",
  ""Last month, we also received approval from the BPU for New Jersey Natural Gas to expand its energy efficiency offerings available through SAVEGREEN through 2027."",
  ""At CEV, we continue to focus on commercial solar with over one 1 gigawatt in our project pipeline, the largest in our company's history."",
  ""In line with this strategy, we just completed the sale of our Sunlight Advantage residential solar portfolio."",
  ""This transaction not only strengthens our balance sheet, but also sharpens our focus on commercial solar growth."",
  ""We are well positioned to capitalize on commercial projects with high single digit unlevered returns, reinforcing our commitment to clean energy and sustainable growth."",
  ""At S&T, Adelphia Gateway filed the rate case with FERC to reflect the investments made in its pipeline system."",
  ""And we are moving forward with our Capacity Recovery Project at Leaf River."",
  ""With a focused strategy and momentum across all segments, NJR is well positioned to deliver on its long term growth objectives, as reflected in our fiscal 2025 NFEPS guidance outlined on the next slide."",
  ""NJR is maintaining its long term NFEPS growth target of 7% to 9%, and after multiple years of outperformance, we are rebasing to $2.83 per share as of this current fiscal year."",
  ""This is consistent with our previously stated long-term NFEPS guidance."",
  ""For fiscal 2025, our initial NFEPS guidance range is $3.05 to $3.20 per share."",
  ""This exceeds our long term growth rate of 7% to 9% and reflects the one-time gain from the Sunlight Advantage transaction."",
  ""We feel that our complementary portfolio of businesses provides a solid foundation that supports this leading growth rate, which we outlined on slide 7."",
  ""Looking ahead, key drivers to achieve our 7% to 9% growth target include continued rate base investments, customer growth and an expansion of our energy efficiency investments through SAVEGREEN at New Jersey Natural Gas."",
  ""Additional capital deployment at CEV, providing stable revenues from commercial solar investments that operate at high operational availability."",
  ""At Leaf River, strong demand for storage capacity that improves our recontracting rates and allows us to further expand our total working capacity."",
  ""At Adelphia, the expected recovery of investments through our rate case."",
  ""And in Energy Services, we continue to benefit from the long-term Asset Management Agreements and stable cash flows."",
  ""Finally, NJR's diversified business model has mechanisms in place that provide additional upside potential, driven by market opportunities and operational performance."",
  ""Together, these drivers offer strong visibility into our long-term growth trajectory."",
  ""On slide 8, we break out our fiscal 2025 NFEPS by segment, with approximately 70% of our NFEPS expected to come from utility operations."",
  ""We have a strong foundation to provide reliable returns and long-term stability for our shareholders."",
  ""Now let's discuss our complementary business units, starting with New Jersey Natural Gas on slide 9."",
  ""At New Jersey Natural Gas, we invested $503 million in fiscal 2024 with 42% of that CapEx providing near real time returns."",
  ""Customer growth remained steady all year, driven by a combination of both new construction and conversions."",
  ""Our focus will be on leveraging advanced technologies and innovation solutions to meet the evolving needs of our customers."",
  ""Moving to slide 10, our Clean Energy Ventures business continues to focus on expanding commercial solar opportunities."",
  ""CEV has over a 1 gigawatt of commercial solar projects as potential investment options."",
  ""Additionally, the sale of Sunlight Advantage strengthens our balance sheet while allowing us to prudently recycle capital."",
  ""Moving to slide 11, our Storage and Transportation business continues to deliver stable returns through fee-based revenues."",
  ""In fiscal 2024, we completed the booster compression project and initiated our 4 Bcf Capacity Recovery Project at Leaf River, supporting incremental firm capacity sales."",
  ""Additionally, we filed a rate case with FERC for Adelphia Gateway to reflect the investments made in our pipeline system, which will further enhance the long term value of this critical infrastructure."",
  ""While we're still in the early stages of the rate case process, we hope to reach a resolution in calendar year 2025."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Roberto for review of the financial results."",
  ""As we execute our strategic plan, NJR is positioned for sustained long-term growth across our diverse businesses."",
  ""With a strong focus on core business expansion, clean energy investments, and maximizing the value of our existing assets, we expect to continue creating significant value for our shareholders."",
  ""We offer a 4% dividend yield and combined with our industry leading long-term NFEPS growth rate, we are targeting a total shareholder return of 11% to 13%."",
  ""To sum up, we are driving growth in a sustainable and disciplined way while continuing to deliver superior returns and position NJR as a leader in energy infrastructure."",
  ""And with New Jersey Natural Gas' base rate case settled and its energy efficiency program approved, NJR has significantly de-risked its financial outlook and positioned itself for additional growth."",
  ""We appreciate that you took the time to join us today, and I'd like to recognize and thank our employees for their hard work during an excellent year for the company."",
  ""Their dedication only serves to drive our performance into the future."",
  ""With that, let's open up the call for questions."",
  ""Welcome to New Jersey Resources' fiscal 2024 fourth quarter and year-end conference call and webcast."",
  ""I'm joined here today by Steve Westhoven, our President and CEO; Roberto Bel, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer as well as other members of our senior management team."",
  ""Certain statements in today's call contain estimates and other forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws."",
  ""We wish to caution listeners that this call that the current expectations, assumptions and beliefs forming the basis of our forward-looking statements include many factors that are beyond our ability to control or estimate precisely."",
  ""This could cause results to materially differ from our expectations as found on slide 2."",
  ""These items can also be found in the forward-looking statements section of yesterday's , furnished on Form 8-K and in our most recent Forms 10-K and 10-Q as filed with the SEC."",
  ""We do not, by including this statement, assume any obligation to review or revise any particular forward-looking statements referenced herein in light of future events."",
  ""We will also be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as net financial earnings or NFE."",
  ""We believe that NFE, net financial loss, utility gross margin, financial margin, adjusted funds from operations and adjusted debt provide a more complete understanding of our financial performance."",
  ""However, these non-GAAP measures are not intended to be a substitute for GAAP or non-GAAP financial measures are discussed more fully in Item 7 of our 10-K. The slides accompanying today's presentation are available on our website and were furnished on our Form 8-K filed yesterday."",
  ""Steve will begin with this year's highlights beginning on slide 4, followed by Roberto, who will review our financial results."",
  ""Then we will open the call for your questions."",
  ""With that said, I'll turn the call over to our President and CEO, Steve Westhoven."",
  ""Fiscal 2024 was a strong year for NJR."",
  ""We reported NFEPS on the higher end of our increased guidance range, finishing the year at $2.95 per share, compared with NFEPS of $2.70 per share last year."",
  ""Our business segments performed better than initially expected with strong contributions that allowed us to raise guidance during the year."",
  ""The fourth quarter Energy Services recognized a significant portion of the Asset Management Agreement total revenues, contributing to a notable year-over-year NFE increase."",
  ""As Steve mentioned earlier, the BPU approved a settlement of NJNG's rate case with an annual rate increase of $157 million."",
  ""That became effective on November 21."",
  ""We provided details last week in our 8-K and are also summarizing it on slide 14."",
  ""Under the terms of the settlement, our overall allowed rate of return is 7.08%, which includes a return on equity of 9.6% with a 54% equity layer."",
  ""Our composite depreciation rate increased to 3.21%."",
  ""Overall, we reached a fair and equitable settlement with a rate base of $3.2 billion lower, a 29% increase compared to our last settlement."",
  ""Now let's move to slide 15, where we'll discuss NJR's capital plan."",
  ""Over the next several years, we expect to deploy capital to enhance our utility infrastructure, expand our Clean Energy portfolio, and grow our Storage and Transportation assets."",
  ""For fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, we're planning capital expenditures ranging from $1.3 billion to $1.6 billion, which aligns with our long term NFEPS growth target of 7% to 9%."",
  ""Breaking it down by segment as shown on this slide, NJNG would remain our largest area of investment, with $430 million to $490 million planned for fiscal 2025."",
  ""This includes critical infrastructure upgrades and customer growth projects."",
  ""We will continue to invest in our SAVEGREEN energy efficiency program with approximately $65 million to $75 million projected for the year."",
  ""Moving to CEV, we have planned $160 million and $265 million for fiscal 2025."",
  ""This reflects our continued commitment to growing our commercial solar portfolio."",
  ""While we left the CEV range largely the same from our previous disclosure, this only reflects our expected commercial solar investments following the sale of the Sunlight Advantage residential portfolio."",
  ""Finally, our Storage and Transportation will see investment between $20 million and $35 million in fiscal 2025."",
  ""This includes ongoing projects at Leaf River and Adelphia Gateway, which are expected to generate stable fee-based revenue and support organic growth."",
  ""Our disciplined capital allocation strategy positions NJR to not only deliver on our 7% to 9% long term NFEPS growth, but also to generate stable cash flows and maintain a strong balance sheet."",
  ""As highlighted on slide 16, our strong credit metrics allow us to invest in our businesses while delivering consistent returns for our shareholders."",
  ""Our adjusted funds from operations to adjusted debt ratio was 20.6% for fiscal 2024 and is projected to remain strong, ranging between 18% and 20% for fiscal 2025, which reflects our ability to generate solid operating cash flows and manage that effectively."",
  ""These levels are consistent with maintaining our investment grade credit rating at NJNG and strong balance sheet at NJR."",
  ""Our long-term debt is well staggered with no significant maturities in any particular year."",
  ""This provides us with financial flexibility and reduced risk, especially in an evolving interest rate environment."",
  ""Additionally, we have $825 million in credit facilities available through fiscal 2029, ensuring we have substantial liquidity to support future growth."",
  ""We expect our cash flow from operations to be between $460 million and $500 million in fiscal 2025, providing a solid foundation for funding our capital plan, dividends and our corporate needs."",
  ""Consequently, we also have no need for block equity issuances and only use our year-end investment program as an opportunistic method of raising equity."",
  ""In summary, our strong balance sheet, stable cash flows and superior credit metrics place NJR in an excellent position to continue executing on our strategic priorities while maintaining financial flexibility and delivering long-term shareholder value."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call back to Steve for concluding statements on slide 17.""

  "", Roberto, that's really helpful."",
  ""And maybe a follow-up question."",
  ""Could you maybe provide some initial thoughts on the 2025 IIP ask?"",
  ""And maybe more broadly, could that program look different?"",
  ""And is there a possibility it's not extended by the NJ BPU?"",
  ""I understand you just got the EE order, but just wondering about the IIP program."",
  "", Pat, and  for the time, everyone."",
  ""The guidance range for the year is a little on the wider side for NJNG."",
  ""Can you give us any color on what your thoughts are there in terms of the range and why bigger this year and that sort of stuff?"",
  ""In absolute dollar terms, it looks a little wider to me, maybe not in terms of percentage."",
  ""It just appears a little bit bigger than normal in dollar terms?"",
  ""Can you give us any thoughts in terms of the pluses and minuses on the accretion dilution from the Sunlight Advantage divestiture?"",
  ""Can you give us any thoughts in terms of – you've got a pretty big, I'll call it, backlog of CEV projects under construction at year end."",
  ""Can you give us any thoughts in terms of how those completions play out through 2025?"",
  ""And lastly, as far as the Leaf River expansion goes, can you give us any color in terms of contracting or the increase in the size proportionately or any of those kind of color?"",
  ""I just wonder strategically on the Sunlight Advantage sale, could you talk a little bit more about why deciding to do that now?"",
  ""Why deciding to do it at all?"",
  ""Was it something where someone came to you at a price you liked or was it something where you saw better returns somewhere else in the portfolio?"",
  ""Just wonder if you could talk strategically about that decision."",
  ""I know the dollar goes anywhere, right."",
  ""But your thought here is that you put a lot of those proceeds to support the growth of the solar pipeline more so than the – commercial solar more so than transferring into NGNG – NJNG, right?"",
  ""And then on the step-up in the system integrity CapEx in 2026, how much of that is approved?"",
  ""How much of that is in a program?"",
  ""Kind of what's the sensitivity in terms of regulatory approval around that $200 million or so in 2026?"",
  ""So, I'm just counting on some good read through from the settlement and the support for system integrity."",
  ""Hey,  for the questions."",
  ""So, as far as the commercial portfolio and our electric sales, those will not change into the wholesale market."",
  ""We'll continue to sell the same amount of electric in the wholesale market."",
  ""The residential market was primarily a lease market."",
  ""So, you expect that to be the same going forward."",
  ""And Roberto will take the , Rob."",
  ""So, with the CEV projects that we have in place, we're continuing to construct and we feel good about our CapEx schedule, not only for the year that we just completed, but also going forward."",
  ""We've stated that the increase in the cavern is about 4 Bcf and that's going to be staged in as we kind of , Chris."",
  ""Travis, Sunlight Advantage was a great – integrated business and certainly the team did a great job of developing that business and building it out to what it is today."",
  ""We had the opportunity to simplify our business model a little bit."",
  ""And ultimately, I think it's a good place for our customers, Yeah."",
  ""It's the portfolio of the companies, that we'll take that back in, and certainly when we look at allocating capital All right."",
  ""Hey, Rob, this is Roberto."",
  ""So, regarding the Sunlight Advantage transaction, Hey, Rob, it's Pat Migliaccio."",
  "" for the question and appreciate acknowledging, we've had a busy regulatory calendar."",
  ""So, not only have we now settled the base rate case, which we thought was a very constructive and fair outcome, as you noted, that SAVEGREEN program is largest ever in our history, you can see from our projected CapEx that, that will ramp up over time."",
  ""But not forget the IIP program, we will continue to have capital spend in our fiscal year 2025."",
  ""That was always intended to sunset around this time with a discrete set of projects, and so we will have an opportunity to evaluate what programs in the future might make sense for us and our key stakeholders."",
  ""Chris, are you talking – this is Roberto."",
  ""Are you talking about the earnings guidance range?"",
  ""It is $0.15, $3.05 to $3.20 and it was $0.15 wide last year as well."",
  ""So, there's no real change there."",
  ""I'm – no, you're talking about our earnings guidance, right?"",
  ""So, maybe, Chris, just as a reminder, starting in 2024, we widened the range of our guidance from $0.10 to $0.15."",
  ""But this is the second year we're doing this."",
  ""So, for fiscal 2025, one, you take into account that one-time gain and you net that from dilution and factor Hey, Travis, this is Pat Migliaccio."",
  ""So, everything in that system integrity line item will be subject to rate case filing and rate case review."",
  ""But I think, that while I'll call it a plain vanilla system integrity investment."",
  ""If you look at our last rate case, there was no significant Yes."",
  ""And , everyone, for joining us this morning."",
  ""As always, we appreciate your interest and investment in NJR and have a great day.""

  "" for joining us today for the Q2 FY 2025  of the UFlex Limited."",
  ""Let me draw your attention to the fact that on this call our discussion will include certain forward-looking statements, which has predictions, projections or other estimates about future events."",
  ""These estimates reflect management's current expectations about the future performance of the company."",
  ""Please note that these estimates involve several risk and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from what is expressed or implied."",
  ""I would now request Mr. Rajesh Bhatia, Group President and CFO, for his opening remarks, following which we will open the forum for an interactive session, and answer – a question-and-answer session."",
  "", Surajit and  for the introduction and welcome all the participants on this call."",
  ""You know, the underlying for the Q2 is that, you know, it has been a continuance of the good momentum, mostly started the Q1 with and the same momentum continues in the packaging films business in India and overseas."",
  ""And, you know, that's what is reflected in results."",
  ""Even on the packaging side especially the – our packaging – aseptic packaging, normally Q2 and Q3 are normally a lean features."",
  ""But still in this season, we're seeing a much higher capacity utilization level at 93%, vis-à-vis 83% in the last year."",
  ""The packaging film prices in India are much better."",
  ""Overseas could be still better, but there'll be – because there are a lot of exports happening from India, so prices are remaining in a sort of check."",
  ""But I think the volume has picked up in those markets as well and that bodes us well."",
  ""So, to give you a perspective on the numbers, you would have gone through those, but still I'll The Q2 standalone revenue increase by – standalone now I'm talking about, that increased by 19.3% Y-o-Y to about INR 1,970 crores, again driven by the packaging films revenue growth of 39% Y-o-Y and Q2 standalone sales volume are up 4.2% Y-o-Y, driven by the packaging films sales volume growth of 10.8% Y-o-Y. As I said earlier, the aseptic packaging business continues to do extremely well and this quarter we achieved the capacity utilization of 96% even in this lean period."",
  ""The same period last year, we had achieved a capacity civilization of 83%."",
  ""So, on a Y-o-Y basis, this quarter we've seen a 17.6% volume growth which is there, even in the current – even in the month gone by which is October, the sales volume is up by about 24%."",
  ""So, if I talk about October last year versus October this year, so the good momentum in that business is continuing, and post the capacity expansion to 12 billion packs, which we are expecting by the end of December, so the Q1 – Q4 will be the first period during this fiscal FY 2025 during which we have that capacity available."",
  ""So, we are expecting as of now that business – that enhanced capacity overall utilization for Q4 will be about 83% even post the enhanced capacity to 12 billion packs, which means that on a YoY basis, we have a 20% volume increase in the sales volume."",
  ""So, that's what about the aseptic business."",
  ""Now, India BOPET industry in particular, I just thought I'll make a mention to you."",
  ""Last quarter, when we were – we had – we were there on this call, I had indicated that the And even in the current quarter, over the Q2 quarter, the margins are up by about 20%, which means that if the prices did continue to remain the way they are, the current quarter packaging films business at least on the PET side will be – will also be better in this quarter even over the Q2, which on an industry-wide basis has already seen about 200%-plus the gross margin increases."",
  ""The BOPP industry also, the gross margin increased by about 36% in Q2 over Q1."",
  ""But unfortunately, we've seen some price correction in that market, and in the current quarter that is going on, we are down to almost at a Q1 level."",
  ""So, whatever we achieved in Q2, if we talk at the current levels, all those gains have been diminished."",
  ""On an industry-wide basis, again, the BOPET exports from India in the quarter reduced by about 10% in Q2 over Q1, largely because the prices were good – domestic prices were good in this quarter."",
  ""And even for BOPP, they were down 5% Q2 versus Q1, again, largely because of the higher domestic prices, but exports contracted a bit."",
  ""For UFlex India in Q2, the volume growth in the PET business has been about 14-odd-percent and the – while the overall packaging films volume growth, we've seen about 10.8%."",
  ""But for the PET, where we have a dominant capacity and BOPP capacity – our BOPP capacity is rather not too high."",
  ""So, we witnessed about 14% volume Having said that, all the good things, the flexible packaging margins in this quarter were impacted, as usually happens."",
  ""When the packaging films prices go up so steeply, there is always a lag effect in the packaging – flexible packaging margins, because their prices are fixed for the last indexes which are pertaining to the previous months or quarters."",
  ""And when those prices – when the raw material prices increase – so, during that quarter or that month, you don't get such increases, but those increases come your way in the next month or the next quarter as per the terms with the customer."",
  ""So, we've seen a contraction in margins in that – given that we had a steep increase in the packaging films prices, and that's what sort of kept the margins – brought the margins down a bit both on a consolidated level as well as on a standalone level in this quarter."",
  ""The exceptional items, again, the currency devaluation in Nigeria, Mexico, Egypt continue to affect those -- emanate out of those translation losses."",
  ""As I'd explained earlier also, in Nigeria, we do business in naira, in Mexico in pesos, and Egypt in Egyptian pound."",
  ""And then, the business which is transacted in the local currency has to be converted into the reporting currency which is INR, and there are devaluations of that currency vis-à-vis INR."",
  ""So, you'll always have a situation where you will have those translation losses, which are exceptional in nature, which you see in Nigeria and Egypt and Mexico, all currencies are devaluing continuously at least to the last two fiscal year and even in this quarter seen the currency loss of INR 79 crores in Nigeria which was INR 99 crores in Q1, and in Mexico we've seen INR 14 crore loss which was INR 51 crore in Q1."",
  ""And in Egypt the loss is zero which was INR 39 crores in Q1."",
  ""So, while the losses have come down from a level of INR 180 crore in Q1 throughout, INR 92 crores, INR 93 crores in Q2 but they still continue throughout the year on this level Ignoring these exceptional losses and ignoring some of the M-to-M of the currency swaps that we have."",
  ""The normalized EBITDA for this quarter is INR 438 crore versus INR 408 crore in Q2 of FY 2024."",
  ""Standalone EBITDA is up INR 215 crore this quarter versus INR 168 crores in Q2 of the same period last year."",
  ""And again that is because the packaging films business had seen much higher prices in Gross debt as of 30th September and net debt is at about INR 5,800 crores-odd versus March position was about INR 5,600 crores-odd."",
  ""So, we've seen the net debt increase was only INR 400 crores in the current system, and there are few projects which are under pipeline and we are seeing completion I think in PET Chips plant which we are expecting will come in H2, expected time line is between January to March."",
  ""And this will be a game changer for our offshore business, given that almost – while this will take care of our requirements of the PET Chips in our Egypt business, but this will also cater to our European operations, Nigeria operations as well our operations in the UAE."",
  ""So, all of them will become fully self-sufficient in terms of their raw material requirement."",
  ""And still we have certain surpluses over there which we can – depending on the dynamics of the  We are looking at the markets If we talk about H1 also at the same time, H1, if you see the EBITDA has grown up by about 24-percent-odd, if you compare H1 of last H1 versus H1 of this fiscal."",
  ""And again, it's all driven – largely driven by the packaging sales volume, which is up at about 13.8% on a year-on-year sales."",
  ""And aseptic packaging sales volume up by about 10% Y-o-Y. Now that position more or less our volumes are already So that's been basically in the summary for the financial performance for the Q2 as well as H1."",
  ""We can – we are now open to any Q&A that you would like to ask."",
  ""Some of the details which are not available in the same thing, we will note down and try to get back to you as soon as possible."",
  ""Because sometimes some of the details which are very, sort of, you guys keep on looking at the numbers day in and day out."",
  ""So what we'll try to answer them as best as""

  ""Hello, sir,  for the opportunity."",
  ""Sir, about the US business I wanted to know after the recent political change in US, how do we foresee the market developing over there for us?"",
  ""And sir, the overseas like in – sir, the prices of BOPET and BOPP in overseas market, how are they shaping up."",
  ""  for the opportunity."",
  ""So, I wanted to ask you regarding the CapEx."",
  ""So in Q2, it's mentioned that we have incurred total CapEx of INR 348.8 crores and there is a breakup given."",
  ""So, it's mentioned that INR 122.4 crores is spent towards miscellaneous and maintenance activities."",
  ""So if I remember correctly, I think INR 100 crores to INR 150 crores per year used to be our maintenance CapEx every year."",
  ""So, was there any one-off during the quarter and for the full year, what is the total CapEx guidance, and if you can provide the split between growth and maintenance?"",
  ""So, basically INR 1,000 crores per year for this year and next year based on the ongoing projects."",
  ""And so out of this, how much would be the maintenance CapEx like what is the maintenance CapEx?"",
  ""So on an annual basis, it will still be around INR 200 crores-odd, because I've asked you because in Q2, the number seems very high."",
  ""So secondly, what I wanted to know from you is regarding the overseas business."",
  ""So if we look at the spreads in overseas as in if we look at the EBITDA margins, then there is no improvement on a Q-o-Q basis."",
  ""Now if we look at the Indian data, then clearly the industry spreads and prices have gone up significantly on a sequential basis."",
  ""So you said that in overseas, it is because of the dumping mainly coming from India."",
  ""Did I get that right?"",
  ""Sir is that the – like their Q2 trend is continuing even in the current quarter, or you are seeing some increase in the prices in your overseas operations?"",
  ""Sir, despite this, do you believe that we'll be able to do that INR 2,000 crores plus EBITDA that you've added for the full year or there'll be some change in this?"",
  ""That is it from my side."",
  ""That should be it from my end."",
  ""See, the last CapEx you have announced is for the expansion of aseptic packaging at – in Egypt."",
  ""Is there any other because – is there any other CapEx that is on the table?"",
  ""And can we expect a EBITDA margin of 13%, 14% in the second half?"",
  ""Actually, I'm... That is for Q3 – that's for Q3?"",
  "", ladies and gentlemen, for the engaging questions."",
  ""We will soon have the transcript of this call on our website www.uflexltd.com."",
  ""We look forward to speaking to you again in the coming quarters."",
  "" and have a great day."",
  ""We are very much optimistic about the recycling business."",
  ""But some of the EPR guidelines in Europe and in India are coming, like until Europe, you see new EPR guidelines which mandates the recycling comes into play from 1st of January, in India from 1st of April or 1st of June."",
  ""So there is nothing – there was nothing – while the facilities are there, they are running also as well."",
  ""But what we've been saying is the real momentum comes only when you look at – when the laws are enacted and people are forced to spend extra money in terms of complying with those requirements."",
  ""So that is why while we remain upbeat about that business and that's – we see that's over the next few years that it's also become a very formidable business for us."",
  ""And that this quarter, we've given some – certain numbers in the presentations what we have achieved."",
  ""If you want, I can talk about those numbers."",
  ""But I think those presentations are with you and you can look at in detail where we have given PCR, MLP and all that, what we have achieved in terms of production in this quarter."",
  ""In that, the main – major theme for next few years aided, of course, by the legislation changes in the world markets and India will be operating."",
  ""Now in India also, frankly, there have been a few times the government has postponed the compliances and all that."",
  ""So – because not everybody is ready for it and you know ultimately in this industry, when it's relating to the food packaging, you can't take chances with that."",
  ""So, it's the whole industry."",
  ""If we are prepared, our prepared lens is much ahead of them, still that does not count and the government may take a view that we need to postpone it by another quarter or six months and all that."",
  ""But having said that, this will all come from the regulation only."",
  ""We are ready to sort out. ["",
  ""But otherwise, generally, you can take for a year as a whole about 35-percent-odd. ["",
  ""Foreign Language] (00:30:00-00:30:10), we took about three years to come up to a decent number in that. ["",
  ""Foreign Language] (00:30:17) that was sold out on day one itself."",
  ""This now when we are expanding to above 12 billion packs, we are expecting about 80% to 85% capacity utilization level in the Q1, and obviously, Q2 will be better capacity utilization number."",
  ""Now the next plant we are going to achieve in FY 2026 and beyond."",
  ""You will have to make big things here also, but the markets are so huge, look at when we started in India, we already had tetra pack in India, who was already manufacturing."",
  ""Now Egypt, which is consuming about 5 billion packs a year, has no tetra pack over there."",
  ""So, the Egypt is all importing it's requirements, so that's the markets which comes to you very naturally and then when we look at exporting to Egypt, to Europe from there, you have an advantage from that thing."",
  ""While you're question is right, in terms of, and we may not have all the answers on the Phase-1 for you, but we feel that you will be able to replicate our India's stance in this business, in Egypt very, very successfully and much earlier than what we've achieved in our India business."",
  ""We're very, very upbeat on that capacity."",
  ""In India, we already suffered for a couple of years, because we didn't have the capacity to get into our domestic as well as our offshore customers."",
  ""But since this enablement, if we have been showing capacity between India or Egypt plants serving a few offshore territories, I think we can always swing that, we can look to garner a larger market share in India."",
  ""And if you all believe that next five years, then you become a $5 trillion or $7 trillion economy, the multiplier in fact of that on the consumption economy is going to be the next So you have to set up capacities, you have to look at expanding in a market which is growing and which Yeah, yeah. ["",
  ""If all the states in India were to allow this to take care of spurious liquor issues, I think from the current capacity, we will need at least 3x of the capacity in India only to cater to those – that market."",
  ""But having said that, market is there only in India because only – and we will obviously try to look at [indiscernible] (00:34:44) also, but because India [Foreign Language] (00:34:48) Bihar and all these places."",
  ""You have a lot full of spurious liquor being packed and sold and all that."",
  ""So I think over the period, you will find that many states will allow liquor to be packed in aseptic."",
  ""And the customer allows knows that this is one packaging [Foreign Language] (00:35:19)."",
  ""Like I tell you if I – when I buy ghee for my own home, I buy only tetra pack, [Foreign Language] (00:35:30) aseptic packaging ghee, because that is the only one which is pure. ["",
  ""Foreign Language] (00:35:36-00:35:43) your chances of going wrong are at least 99x of the other packages – in the other packaging. ["",
  ""Foreign Language] (00:36:23) I refrained from giving margins and that is why I said if I think Q1, Q2 May, there has been a 200% rise in the margins, gross margins, and from Q2 versus current quarter also there is a 20% increase in the margin."",
  ""But margin is a very [Technical Difficulty] (00:36:46)."",
  ""I am saying I refrained from giving an absolute number of the margins and I gave the margins... ...since So, I'm quite confident that H2 margins in the BOPET industry will remain at reasonable levels."",
  ""Frankly, I feel that the BOPET margins currently what are prevailing, there may be a little scope for them to be better."",
  ""And it's a dynamic situation, because the BOPET exports have gone down by 10% in this quarter versus the Q1."",
  ""So with more product availability in the domestic market, the market may take a cut in the margins again."",
  ""Then again, exports will rise."",
  ""And then, this phenomenon will continue."",
  ""But the current margins on a more or less, I think BOPET margins should be better than what they are, and hopefully, in H2 those margins will be at a Q2 level, which will be great for the industry."",
  ""Having said that, the demand-supply equilibrium in the PET versus BOPET, BOPET it is better, but still the BOPET prices are lower because [Foreign Language] (00:39:21-00:39:27)."",
  ""So PET exports have really jumped from India, which means that the capacity available to cater to the local market is lesser and that's why the prices have firmed up."",
  ""So, the opportunity is always there, because India is a much cheaper cost jurisdiction as compared to Europe or the America."",
  ""Still, [Foreign Language] (00:41:13-00:41:32) so which will give you in the markets we operate in what are the levels, our capacity utilization levels in those markets."",
  ""And obviously, you see that there is this – in the past we have achieved a much higher peaks in those markets."",
  ""And so which means that today that is being serviced from India at the cheaper cost as compared to what is being produced in those markets or other players."",
  ""In overseas markets, there was not an irrational capacity addition what we witnessed in India and that's where somewhere the equilibrium – all the producers from India are trying to maintain their demand/supply equilibrium in India by exporting [indiscernible] (00:42:22)."",
  ""If you see the slide 9 of our presentation, you will find all the answers as to – as what capacity utilization levels, our all plants are operating."",
  ""Poland and Hungary facility, Poland especially, which is the PET, we have capacity utilization currently of – last quarter of about 68% which was in Q1 at about 78%, but in the past we have achieved almost 100% capacity utilization in that facility itself."",
  ""USA is more than 100%, so we are doing perfectly well over there."",
  ""If we see Mexico, Mexico we're doing about 85%, but that is not the because of any other things, that is because the plant has some technical issues, which are being looked into."",
  ""In terms of demand of the product in the Americas market, I had explained on this call last time also that our combined capacity in Mexico and USA is about 8,000 tons a month, while we've been now So, I think the best way, according to me, is to separate your commodity business from value-added business from – your packaging business would command a different multiples as compared to your packaging films business, your aseptic business, your chemicals business will command a different premium, and that's also a very substantial business for us."",
  ""So, restructuring maybe one way to unlock that value, which is quite common in the corporates that your separate your businesses into separate company so that each business is much more visible."",
  ""And the second is that we have now been presenting to you our turnovers, our volumes from each of these businesses, the kind of margins we have in each one of these businesses."",
  ""So, I think before – I will suggest to all of the investors who are on the call to look at these details with much more insight and see that what is the value."",
  ""I think the management idea is that when the businesses have achieved the substantial size and that needs to be operated as a separate entity, only then we should look to at the restructuring aspect of it."",
  ""But when they are too much interdependent on each other and all of that then creating – so, today, yes, we have the separate SBUs, but creating those – transferring those SBUs to separate companies will only emerge at a stage where the interdependence of the businesses are much lesser and typically a packaging and a packaging film – flexible packaging and packaging films business, which has packaging film there, this raw materials, I think those linkages will have to come down pretty sort of drastically."",
  ""Again, some of the other initiatives, which we had taken earlier and I had shared with you that listing our offshore subsidiary in Dubai, in NYSE and so some of those initiatives again we will – and the markets have not been there for the last couple of years to – for those initiatives to be implemented."",
  ""But we surely implement those and that is a low-hanging fruit that if you can list your offshore subsidiary and when we were talking to our bankers on that, the valuations being offered by them were much more than the India valuation."",
  ""So, obviously the India valuations would have got adjusted looking at the offshore business valuations."",
  ""We – cognizant of that fact, including – carving out each one of the business."",
  ""But, let – first be – it be of a substantial size and as a first step we can look to list our offshore subsidiaries to increase our shareholders' value."",
  ""You're talking about the US markets or?"",
  ""So, we are very upbeat about our US markets, with all the focus of the new government as we hear from the media and all that, that US should get back to its core manufacturing also and stop importing the products from China and other jurisdictions."",
  ""So, I think we – currently also, we're doing very well in the America markets as I said that we already are As I had said that there is a competition from cheaper imports into US from India, so the prices are sort of being – are under check."",
  ""But as you know the India will start to ease in terms of its demand/supply situations, the market will be – the prices will be better."",
  ""Given the fact that we are already operating at more than 100% capacity in those markets currently, despite the margin pressure, the prices pressure in there, that itself speaks volumes that we are competitive in the market."",
  ""And obviously, as a US manufacturer over the – the products coming from India, you definitely get a premium over a period of time."",
  ""But, those are extent of the current premiums?"",
  ""I think there is a scope for them to improve."",
  ""And it will improve over the next six months to a year time or so, because India market growth being at about 10% to 12%, that itself will mean you're your propensity to export will keep on So I think as of now what we have on the CapEx side is already disclosed to you that what we spent on each one of those projects."",
  ""So the two projects out of those four – actually three out of those four, which are being completed in the current financial year itself."",
  ""So, there is about $18 million will be spent on our Egypt PET facility project."",
  ""There is about for $1 million, $2 million will be spent on our project for the CPP facility in Mexico."",
  ""And then, in Sanand also I think maybe another INR 50 crores-odd would be remaining to be spent in terms of the existing project, which we are competing this year."",
  ""Then there is this $126 million, which we have to spend on the aseptic packaging, which will happen largely in FY 2026."",
  ""So, if you see the growth in the debt from March to September, this being to the tune of about INR 200 crores while we have spent in H1 CapEx of – how much we've spent on H1 CapEx?"",
  ""Just a moment  Yes."",
  ""So, as I've said, overseas margins could be better, but because currently there is – Indian exporters are exporting a lot to Europe as well as America so their prices are under sort of check."",
  ""Q3 also we will – we are more or less at the same number."",
  ""No, I think so we will get that because that number was – you are predicting that number on the basis of our Mexico CPP line coming into play, our flagships in Egypt coming into play in November earlier, but now it is being delayed a bit and our incremental Sanand capacity coming into play for which, as I said at – on a q-o-q basis in Q4 we will be 20% higher sales volume in that."",
  ""So, existing business, plus as I said Q2 – Q3 [Foreign Language] (01:00:17) BOPET margins are 20% higher over Q2, and the lag impact of what we had in Q2 for the packaging business, that will also [ph] be gone by (01:00:32)."",
  ""We'll have higher capacity available for the Sanand for Q4."",
  ""The PET chip capacity will come into play, which will give you the savings, which will – may not give you a very large turnover unless you want to sell outside."",
  ""But it will give you a saving in terms of your raw material cost."",
  ""So, INR 2,000 crores is pretty much in sight. ["",
  ""As of now, there is nothing which is on the table, which is approved by the board and announced by us."",
  ""Having said that, as I said earlier as well that in the US market, there is a clear gap today between what we sell and what we produce."",
  ""So, as and when the management may take its view that we need to have – because that gap which is 2,000 to 2,500 tons today, in two years' time, we expect that gap may be 3,000, 3,500-odd tons."",
  ""So, you will have to take a call in terms of producing it locally."",
  ""So, one – that is one area where I see that as and when there's the management and the board call to take that, that we need to produce this locally rather than importing it from other jurisdictions."",
  ""That is one thing which I find that is a low-hanging fruit."",
  ""Other than that, I really don't think so."",
  ""But having said that, we keep on looking at opportunities in terms of where we can get a good project in the existing lines of business and all that."",
  ""But I don't think so there is any other than that possible in the packaging film – so, there are three businesses The next one is aseptic, where we are – already announced."",
  ""So, the total capacity is going to be about 24 billion packs, of which currently we're selling about from India in Q4 at a run rate of about 10 billion packs."",
  ""So, FY 2026, we will see as to what extent we can utilize that capacity from there."",
  ""But clearly, having shown that intent to increase that capacity from 12 billion to 24 billion packs, there is work to be done over the next few years in terms of absorbing and utilizing that capacity."",
  ""Then, our third large SBU is flexible packaging, in which – where we don't have any international plans at all, as I've said many more times, and currently, we don't have any other plans to expand in India also in that."",
  ""EBITDA margins for Q2, I think we are targeting about Between 13%, 13.5%."",
  ""No, I'm talking about H2."",
  ""So, we are targeting 13%, 13.5%."",
  "" for these extensive questions."",
  ""I must compliment you. ["",

  ""We are only trying to improve our product profiles to more of pouching, less of roll form where the margins are higher."",
  ""So we are not you know, you have seen over the quarter the volumes in that business are closer to about 20,000 tonnes a quarter."",
  ""So we are not – we don't have a surplus capacity, much surplus capacity and we are not planning any further capacity to take that business forward."",
  ""Having said that, [Foreign Language] (01:21:50-01:22:06) some of our large customers, I will not name them, when they work in India market and they work in the world markets, their behavior [indiscernible] (01:22:16) with respect to onboarding a vendor based on just the pricing is very much different."",
  ""So, these large customers will never onboard a vendor who is not a renowned name in the converting in the fee and all that."",

  ""So that is why the competition in some of the products is much more."",

  ""Ceragon delivered another strong quarter in the third quarter of 2024, benefiting from continued execution and from robust demand, especially in India."",
  ""We achieved our targets for the growth and profitability and narrowed our full-year outlook, maintaining the midpoint by putting a finer point on the range."",
  ""Increasingly, diversification is playing an important role in our success."",
  ""The geographical diversification has already proven itself this quarter while we also make progress in diversifying our business into private network business."",
  ""For example, in this quarter we added four new private network customers to our customer base and since the beginning of the year we have penetrated 16 new private network customers, representing approximately $11.5 million in incremental bookings from customers in the private networks sector."",
  ""We are also making good progress in our product roadmap."",
  ""For example, we have generated meaningful orders from our new IP-50EX and increased interest in our upcoming IP-50EX Premium that is about to be released shortly."",
  ""This product is intended to use millimeter wave frequency over a much longer distance, exploiting the high-capacity advantage of these frequencies and reducing total cost of ownership."",
  ""We have started a soft promotion of our first Neptune-based product, the IP-100E, and have already seen very positive feedback."",
  ""The first version of this product is intended to deliver 25 gigabit per second capacity in a single box with a compelling total cost of ownership profile."",
  ""We tend to present the first units of this product at the Mobile World Congress."",
  ""We have recently started multiple new POCs for our network digital twin and the initial feedback is very positive."",
  ""I'd now like to provide an overview of our Q3 highlights by region, noting that on today's call we will focus primarily on activities in North America and India, the two regions that have and we expect will continue to have the greatest impact on our results in the near term."",
  ""In North America, revenue was $24.5 million."",
  ""In the private networks segment, we have built a very strong pipeline and are working to leverage our completed project to build our brand in this domain."",
  ""In fact, our success with the city of Cincinnati continues to be a case study deployment for us and the level of satisfaction is also driving proactive references from existing customers to new potential customers adding to our funnel of opportunities."",
  ""We are also leveraging Siklu's strong brand in the enterprise security domain for attaining more business."",
  ""Our bookings for private networks declined in the quarter compared to the prior quarter."",
  ""We believe this was a timing factor associated with seasonality and longer sales cycle and not a demand factor as supported by the healthy pipeline we have built."",
  ""We anticipate private networks playing an increased role in our growth going forward."",
  ""In Communications Service Provider segment, Q3 has demonstrated some slowdown in the ordering pace, primarily from Tier 1 customers similar to the dynamics some of our peers have mentioned."",
  ""Following multiple discussions with our main customer, we believe this was a short-term phenomenon relating mostly to timing of network build over the year."",
  ""We are off to a much stronger start in the fourth quarter related to bookings as we have received a substantial value of orders, which supports our current assessment."",
  ""In India, revenue was $50.5 million, an all-time record quarter for Ceragon."",
  ""We have been shipping and deploying equipment related to both our long-standing customer as well as the new customer we won in Q4 2023."",
  ""These deployments are supporting both customers in their expansion of 4G and 5G networks."",
  ""In addition, due to our technological strength and market leader position, we are further growing our business in India and diversifying to another customer that recently announced a multibillion-dollar project for upgrading its network to 4G and 5G. Since Q3, we have received more than $18 million in orders from this customer for microwave products further increasing substantially our market share."",
  ""We expect more orders from this customer in the coming quarters for our microwave as well as our E-band solutions."",
  ""Since participating in the India Mobile Congress, we are encouraged by the increasing level of traction we are receiving in India and see large opportunities for 2025."",
  ""We believe that we will see much higher demand for E-band products in 2025 and our IP-50EX Advanced provides capabilities that fit the specific needs of the Indian market."",
  ""So, we are very well positioned to capitalize on incremental growth opportunities."",
  ""Since there are multiple discussions about the general business environment, I would like to share with you our observations."",
  ""Indeed, we have seen a slowdown in certain public network domains outside of India."",
  ""We believe this is primarily driven by the global economy and the level of demand for – for – for 5G by network users."",
  ""In addition, in Latin America, Africa and some countries in Asia PAC, Chinese competition is very fierce in these regions driving business softness there."",
  ""In this – in these regions we are increasing our focus on the private networks segment where there is lower Chinese presence."",
  ""We also see an interesting opportunity in the current market conditions as multiple service providers are now focusing on fixed subscriber growth and using wireless technology with 5G high frequencies."",
  ""We are in multiple discussions with large operators exploring opportunities to leverage Siklu's point to multipoint technology to address this increasing need in other frequencies."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Ronen Stein, our CFO, to discuss the results in more detail."",
  "" for joining us today."",
  ""Hosting today's call is Doron Arazi, Ceragon's Chief Executive Officer; and Ronen Stein, Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""Before we start, I would like to remind everyone that certain statements made on this call, including projected financial information and other results, could contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995."",
  ""Forward-looking statements are statements that are not subject to historical facts."",
  ""Such statements reflect current expectations and assumptions of Ceragon's management."",
  ""Actual results may differ materially as they are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements."",
  ""These risks and uncertainties could affect results of operations."",
  ""Such risks are discussed in detail in Ceragon's most recent Annual Report on Form 20-F as published on March 21, 2024, as well as in other documents that may subsequently be filed by Ceragon from time-to-time with the Securities and Exchange Commission."",
  ""Forward-looking statements relate to the date initially made and they are not predictions of future events or results and there can be no assurances that they will prove to be accurate and Ceragon undertakes no obligation to update them."",
  ""Ceragon's public filings are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at sec.gov that may also be obtained from Ceragon's website at ceragon.com."",
  ""Also, today's call will include certain non-GAAP numbers."",
  ""For a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results, please see the table attached to the press release that was issued earlier this morning, which is posted on the Investor Relations section of Ceragon's website."",
  ""With that, I will now turn the call over to Doron."",
  ""Doron, the call is yours."",
  ""Doron spoke to our revenue diversification, an important strategic point, and he also mentioned our ability to extract operating leverage from our business model."",
  ""I'd like to highlight the operating leverage as we drove increasing operating income, even with modest gross margin compression."",
  ""To help you understand the results, I will be referring primarily to non-GAAP financials."",
  ""For more information regarding our use of non-GAAP financial measures, including reconciliations of these measures, we refer you to today's press release."",
  ""Let me now review the actual results."",
  ""Revenues were $102.7 million, up 17.7%, from $87.3 million in Q3 2023."",
  ""Our strongest regions in terms of revenues for the quarter were India and North America, with $50.5 million and $24.5 million, respectively."",
  ""Our third strongest region in terms of revenues was EMEA with $14.9 million."",
  ""We had three customers in the third quarter that contributed more than 10% of our revenues."",
  ""Gross profit for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $35.2 million, an increase of 15.9% compared to $30.4 million in Q3 2023."",
  ""Our non-GAAP gross margin was 34.3%, compared with gross margin of 34.9% in Q3 2023."",
  ""We continue to achieve high gross margins despite the change in regional revenue mix."",
  ""We achieved this by increasing revenues and recognizing continued improvement in product costs."",
  ""We also maintained control although our fixed costs, all of which had a positive effect."",
  ""Our gross margins may continue to fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter due to changes in product and regional mix."",
  ""As for our operating expenses, in general, operating expenses in 2024 fully include the impact of the Siklu acquisition at the end of 2023 and thus impact the comparison to 2023 operating expenses."",
  ""Research and development expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $8.6 million, up from $7.3 million in Q3 2023."",
  ""As a percentage of revenue, our R&D expenses were 8.4% in the third quarter compared to 8.3% in the third quarter last year."",
  ""Sales and marketing expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $10.4 million, up from $9.7 million in Q3 2023."",
  ""As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 10.1% in the third quarter, compared to 11.1% in the third quarter last year."",
  ""General and administrative expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $0.4 million, compared to $5.5 million in Q3 2023."",
  ""As a percentage of revenues, G&A expenses were less than 1% in the third quarter, compared to 6.2% in the third quarter last year."",
  ""The main reason for the reduction in G&A is the impact of approximately $5.1 million benefit related to payments on account of a debt settlement agreement reached with the South American customer, for which we accounted the credit loss at the end of 2022."",
  ""This payment reduced our G&A expenses in the quarter."",
  ""I'd note that Siklu has been successfully integrated in the first half of 2024 and therefore we have not recorded any integration costs related to Siklu in our GAAP operating expenses."",
  ""Operating income for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $15.8 million, compared with $8 million for Q3 2023."",
  ""As a percentage of revenue, non-GAAP operating income was 15.4% in the third quarter, compared to 9.2% in the third quarter last year."",
  ""Without the approximately $5.1 million debt collection benefits included in the G&A, non-GAAP operating income would be $10.8 million and as a percentage of revenues 10.5%."",
  ""Financial and other expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $1.2 million, positively impacted from favorable foreign exchange changes and to a lesser extent reduction in interest expenses as we continue to strengthen our balance sheet."",
  ""Our tax expenses for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $0.6 million."",
  ""Net income for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $14.1 million or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $5 million or $0.06 per diluted share for Q3 2023."",
  ""Without the approximately $5.1 million benefit related to the debt collection included in the G&A, non-GAAP net income would be $9 million or $0.10 per diluted share."",
  ""As for our balance sheet, our cash position at the end of the third quarter was $34 million, compared to $28.2 million at the end of 2023."",
  ""Short-term loans were $25.2 million, compared to $32.6 million as of December 31, 2023."",
  ""Therefore, we shifted to net positive cash of $8.8 million compared to negative net cash position of $4.4 million at December 31, 2023."",
  ""We generated significant cash in the quarter and continued to reduce our debt as a result."",
  ""We believe we have cash and facilities that are sufficient for our operations and working capital needs."",
  ""Our inventory at the end of Q3 2024 was $59.8 million, down from $68.8 million at the end of December 2023."",
  ""The reduction is mainly related to our continued efforts since 2023 to streamline inventory levels following the improvement in components availability and substantial shipments to India."",
  ""We continue to monitor inventory levels taking into consideration the improvements in the availability of components and expected changes in demand."",
  ""Our trade receivables at the end of Q3 2024 are $121.6 million as compared to $104.3 million at the end of December 2023."",
  ""Our DSO now stands at 118 days."",
  ""As for our cash flow, net cash flow generated by operations and investing activities in the third quarter of 2024 was $10.7 million."",
  ""We are reiterating the midpoint of our full-year outlook."",
  ""For 2024, we expect revenues of $390 million to $400 million, representing growth of 12% to 15% compared to 2023."",
  ""This guidance includes the contribution from Siklu."",
  ""You will note that we have narrowed the expected range, increasing the bottom end of the range by $5 million and decreasing the top end by a similar amount, leaving the midpoint unchanged."",
  ""This reflects our visibility with just two months left in the year."",
  ""Non-GAAP operating margins are targeted to be at least 10% at the midpoint of the revenue guidance."",
  ""As a result, we expect increased non-GAAP profit representing another record year and positive free cash flow for the full year of 2024."",
  ""With that, I now open the call for your questions.""
]","[
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""Doron, Ronen, congrats on the quarter."",
  ""Maybe to just start off on India, a record quarter."",
  ""Doron, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about how the outlook is shaping up for India as you look into the fourth quarter?"",
  ""And I know it's a little bit early, but your maybe initial thoughts on 2025 in terms of the sustainability of that kind of strength, particularly it sounds like you've got that third major customer start to ramp up?"",
  ""So, Doron, just to follow up, so in terms of higher capacity, that means more E-band, which you guys are pretty well positioned for."",
  ""Maybe moving on to the private networks side, it seems like demand there continues to be pretty strong."",
  ""I'm wondering if you could talk about from a vertical market standpoint where you're seeing some of that demand."",
  ""And if you could clarify a little bit, it sounds like Siklu, you might be taking it from V-band to other frequencies."",
  ""I just wanted to clarify that with your opening remarks I was thinking more in the 28 gig to 39 gig ranges is kind of what you're talking about."",
  ""I was wondering if you could provide any clarity on that front."",
  ""And lastly if I could, the guidance on the year, kind of extrapolating that into the fourth quarter implies flattish to up 10%."",
  ""I'm wondering if you could just give us some thoughts in terms of what the swing factors are to either end of that range?"",
  ""And lastly use of the cash, you're in a luxury position now of generating a fair amount of cash."",
  ""How are you thinking about redeploying that?"",
  ""Doron, Ronen,  so much."",
  ""Great job on the quarter and look forward to seeing you guys next week in New York."",
  ""Hi, can you hear me okay?"",
  ""I want to follow up on your private network opportunity there."",
  ""And can you speak a little more about the channel, how that may be different, what sorts of channels you're maybe lighting up to access these new markets, I assume primarily in North America and whether these channels will have any impact on your cost of sales as it relates to your model as you grow the private networks business?"",
  ""And for these larger deals that you're direct on, what's the kind of range of the size of deals you think that you typically are pursuing direct there?"",
  ""And maybe a follow up if I could around gross margins and your internal silicon development there, any puts or takes we should think about as we model forward into 2025 in terms of your – your – your fab costs or FPGA's et cetera?"",
  ""That's all the questions I had."",
  ""Can you hear me, Doron?"",
  ""Doron, over the last few years you've targeted growth in managed services and private networks."",
  ""And really seen a great job as a result of your efforts."",
  ""As I'm increasingly hearing from you, I think from our recent conversations, the potential that you see in millimeter wave and obviously with the new products, I know the IP-100 is coming."",
  ""I wonder though if you could just give us a kind of a longer-term outlook that you have for that business and then how you plan to target that, whether it's broadening the product portfolio, the opportunity that you see in millimeter wave here over the next several years of growth in that segment of the market."",
  ""I wonder if you could just give us a little more of your thoughts on that, please?"",
  ""And how should we think about the long-term margin opportunity also from that business as that theoretically grows as a percentage of total revenues over time?"",
  ""Congratulations on an excellent quarter Doron, especially considering how challenging the end markets have been."",
  ""Let's talk about this Siklu opportunity in fixed wireless."",
  ""I know it's very early and you're still testing the technology, but if some Tier 1 operators around the globe really want to penetrate a fixed wireless approach for incremental broadband, I guess – I guess someone is doing it here in the US with – with as you said very expensive cellular 5G technology, a pink company, let's say."",
  ""How big could that TAM be over a five-year period?"",
  ""Is that a – is that a $50 million opportunity or would that be a $500 million opportunity?"",
  ""Can you give us some sense of if this thing sort of takes off, how big could it be?"",
  ""That would be a nice addition to our growth rate."",
  "" for sizing that for us as an opportunity early in the process."",
  ""On a different subject, there's supposedly a lot of money around for I guess broadband, rural broadband in the US, tens of billions of dollars."",
  ""It seems like none of it ever got spent, despite the fact that the Democratic administration tried to spend themselves out of money in the last few years with our deficit."",
  ""Is there any opportunity that with a change in administration that and perhaps some more government efficiency that money gets spent and not just for rural fiber, but for rural broadband and we get a significant bump in the US business at some point in our lifetimes from these subsidies that have been out there and unused forever?"",
  ""I don't know if Trump knows what he's going to do."",
  ""We will see revenue from the Neptune-related products start to scale in 2026, correct?"",
  ""I guess my question is who's going to buy it with your – the profile of your clientele right now, which is that – is that a Tier 1 product for US and Europe, European companies?"",
  ""Or you're not very well represented there."",
  ""So, I'm just trying to figure out, does that, does, does the success of that product require three, four, five major new customers?"",
  ""And actually let me get one more in."",
  ""What's the odds of you doing a – a small bolt-on in the private network arena in 2025?"",
  ""Handicap that for me, buddy."",
  ""I want, so 10% chance or 70% chance?"",
  ""Appreciate all your responses and congratulations again on a solid quarter."",
  ""So, I think that we are very well positioned for another strong year in India for a few reasons."",
  ""First of all we are able to diverse our business between three customers or three major customers."",
  ""And obviously we continue to speak with other customers."",
  ""And on top of that, the situation in India nowadays is that while maybe on the classical 5G mobility part, they don't see yet a very strong ROI, and most of the customers at least we are working with are focusing on first of all enhancing their network to 4G and are looking for more use cases that can help them generate more revenue, primarily in the fixed wireless domain."",
  ""And that requires more capacity capabilities and this is why we believe that 2025 can be another strong year for us."",
  ""And we obviously are talking with all these customers and they're getting some initial indications and it looks like indeed they plan to continue investing based on the strategy that I was just trying to describe in like two sentences."",
  ""So, to be more precise, at this point the vast majority of our business is in the microwave that is helping them to enhance their network to 4G and obviously to cover some uncovered areas."",
  ""What we see now is that demand for E-band is increasing and we believe that on the second part of 2025 we will see more deployment of E-band."",
  ""So, let's start with the second question."",
  ""So, as I explained in my prepared remarks and also just right now to the previous question, we see a trend in I would say many operators, Tier 1 operators around the world that try to leverage these high frequencies towards fixed wireless access."",
  ""It looks like at this point mobility using this, these high frequencies is not that of a viable solution."",
  ""And many operators are trying to divert the usage of this, these frequencies into helping them with the fixed wireless offering."",
  ""Now, if you look at the solutions that are in the market nowadays, the 5G standard solutions are very expensive and it still or it doesn't work at least for some of the operators and it doesn't make a reasonable ROI for them to go for – for the standard 5G. Maybe this will change down the road."",
  ""But at this point many of the operators are looking for solutions at these frequencies that are not necessarily 5G standard and by that are reducing the – the cost dramatically."",
  ""We believe that the technology that was developed by Siklu for the V-band point to multipoint, it could be a so to speak converted into solutions at the 26 to 39 or 28 to 39 frequencies."",
  ""And as we speak, we are actually in multiple discussions with different operators to see whether this could be a viable solution for them."",
  ""Now, as to – as to your first question about the private networks, look, we're focusing on I would say four main segments that we believe are I would say less agnostic to technology."",
  ""And at the same token, the demand for more capacity for enhanced private networks is critical."",
  ""One is defense and the second one is generally speaking, private – public safety."",
  ""And third one is energy and the last one is a government and state solutions that needs private networks."",
  ""We feel that there is a demand in all of these, in all of these segments that is strong enough."",
  ""And for each and every one, there is a reason why it is strong."",
  ""But generally speaking, these are the main focus areas for us."",
  ""So, I will start by – by saying that the – the fourth quarter is primarily – the fourth quarter revenue results is primarily dependent on a delivery, which means to what extent our customers will stick to the plan to basically accept our products."",
  ""Sometimes they have their own decisions that are driven by end year on their side and therefore there could be some fluctuations."",
  ""We had the similar situation in the past."",
  ""So, we are very careful."",
  ""But I would say that we have the backlog, we have the orders and it's more about the timing of delivery that can make the numbers either on the high end or on the low end of the range."",
  ""In terms of accumulating cash, look, first of all if we continue with this growth, obviously the need for more working capital is taken into account."",
  ""Secondly, let's not forget we are still leveraged by certain dollar value of loans and with the interest that we have today this is a burden that if we can reduce it to the minimum possible, we can just create additional few cents on an annual basis to our shareholders and improve our – improve our results."",
  ""Obviously, we continue to look into acquisition opportunities."",
  ""Obviously, we are talking about small opportunities."",
  ""And if we find a right match like the Siklu case that is proven to be quite successful, we will explore that kind of acquisition seriously and we use the cash to – to make this kind of acquisitions."",
  ""So, so first of all our go-to-market strategy is primarily based on the salespeople who are basically chasing direct deals."",
  ""And so this is one part of it."",
  ""And generally speaking, we have already made this shift and added the firepower in terms of salespeople that we thought is needed in 2024."",
  ""So, this is already part of our sales and marketing."",
  ""We do use and we intend to maybe even use more, some business development consultants to help us with the penetration."",
  ""I don't think it's going to change dramatically the sales and marketing expenses."",
  ""And obviously there's multiple deals that are by far much smaller."",
  ""And we have a very strong indirect business in North America, but also outside North America with very valuable distributors."",
  ""And these are I would say additional stream or vector to approach the market specifically for the smaller deals."",
  ""Usually, it will be a few million dollars deal."",
  ""It can start small and develop."",
  ""We've seen this kind of situation where you start with a couple of hundreds of thousands of dollars and then you expand."",
  ""And we have also seen situations where you win an RFP for a few million dollars and then there is change requests and additions, and suddenly numbers could be higher by 50% and even more."",
  ""But the typical deal would probably be low end, single digit of million dollars."",
  ""So, so at this point, I don't think that it will make a big change to our gross margin in 2025."",
  ""I think that in 2025 the volume of selling this product based on the demand that we see for 25-gig product is not going to be that high."",
  ""I believe that towards the second part of the year, we start seeing a more significant ramp up of orders."",
  ""So, all in all I don't think we at this point need to model any significant change in gross margins."",
  ""Yeah, if – if you look – if you look at the analysts' reports that are covering our space, they are projecting double-digit growth for the millimeter wave, while the total market is not going to grow that much, it's more of a low single digit."",
  ""And this is why we're putting so much focus on, on millimeter wave."",
  ""And – and I think that with the most recent IP-50EX with its different versions that are meant to cover different use cases, together with the 100-E, that will be very compelling in terms of capacity versus total cost of ownership."",
  ""And we can probably accelerate our growth in this particular part of the market and take a bigger market share."",
  ""And by that we can probably outpace the low single-digit growth that is expected for the market as a whole."",
  ""So, that's the strategy behind focusing so much on, on millimeter wave products and solutions."",
  ""Look, that's obviously depends on the – on the competition."",
  ""I – at this point I believe that our IP-50EX series and the upcoming 100-E will put us in a position where we can increase our gross margins slightly relative to the current margins we have seen."",
  ""And obviously if the competition catches up, it's always something that we are taking into account."",
  ""It doesn't change the range that we said a few times recently that our long-term objective is to still be in between the 35% to 38% gross margin and the fluctuation will probably be primarily due to the region – regional mix as we have seen, for example, in this last quarter."",
  ""Well, knowing the nature of the beast and knowing the customers that we're talking with, I can – I can think about anything between $50 million and $150 million over two to three years."",
  ""Robert, I'm not a politician."",
  ""And for me as an outsider to North America or to the US, I see – I read the different publications."",
  ""I don't know what Trump is going to do."",
  ""Maybe you know better than I. I think that there's different – looking at the messages that are coming across, there could be different opportunities, if for example, for example, the issue of the immigrants is indeed something that he will be taking care of, it could increase the cost of building infrastructure."",
  ""So, almost by definition and that's a theory that I'm sharing with you, it's my own theory."",
  ""As a result of that, fiber will become even less economically viable solution as opposed to wireless."",
  ""That could be an opportunity."",
  ""Maybe with Trump's approach to be more, so to speak, to give more freedom in terms of the decision makers by the investors, maybe the strict guidance to use primarily fiber will change to just give the minimum capacity."",
  ""You decide which technology you want to use in order to make your ROI in the best possible."",
  ""And that can obviously change and move the needle towards more wireless transport as opposed to fiber."",
  ""But all these things are theories and I assume you know better than I, what Trump is going to do."",
  ""Look, I hope to start seeing revenue in the second part of 2025, but this is my hope."",
  ""And when looking into 2025 and now working on the annual operational plan, we're baking a very small portion into – into this – into this product in terms of revenue."",
  ""So, I mentioned in my prepared comments that we did some sort of soft promotion with certain customers around the globe."",
  ""Most of them are our – our customers, but some of them are our prospects."",
  ""I think that it is a viable solution for Tier 1 operators in North America."",
  ""And it could also be a viable solution for countries where maybe the width of the channel is not that big, but they are still in a situation where they want to increase their capacity using E-band solution."",
  ""So, maybe they will not get to 25 gigabit per second because of their channel bandwidth – channel width."",
  ""But they can, they will be still able to multiple their current width for a cost that is very compelling, especially as opposed to the option of putting two radios next to each other."",
  ""And therefore I can see viable opportunities across the globe."",
  ""And yes it's probably going to start with Tier 1 operators."",
  ""There is always a chance."",
  ""Well, I'm not in the business of statistics."",
  ""Now, we can hear you."",
  ""I don't think I have sufficient knowledge about, specifically about the defense."",
  ""What I do know is that it's a – it's a federal stuff and it requires certain level of I would say clearances to be able to sell there."",
  ""Now, on the one hand, we are selling already to different defense units across the world."",
  ""And in some of the cases, we are making or doing this clearance process, using the relationship between the Israeli Ministry of Defense and the – the other country's Ministry of Defense."",
  ""I am not sure if this is a viable or easy, relatively easy way to do this kind of things with the – with the American defense."",
  ""It looks to me that it's much more complex."",
  ""But I can assure you that definitely if we find some sort of an avenue to get in there, I think that we have a very compelling technologies and some very recent use cases that could be of an interest to the American military."",
  ""Ceragon continues to focus on its growth initiatives, primarily millimeter wave products, private networks and managed services and improves its strategic position in the market."",
  ""We are adding new customers each quarter and growing our addressable market."",
  ""Short-term fluctuations in buying patterns in the US likely related to election concerns have not diminished our current outlook, and we are making up for these fluctuations and the headwinds in other regions by our strong business in India."",
  ""With our healthy funnel of opportunities, we expect that the ramp up in our private networks business, especially in the regions suffering from headwinds, will help resume growth in the longer run."",
  ""Our new products and solutions, as well as Neptune-based future product, are gaining meaningful traction and positive feedback respectively."",
  ""These market signals, together with our long-term product roadmap, are building our confidence in long-term growth, as they are expected to result in increasing market share in our space."",
  ""I look forward to updating you further on our next quarterly call."",
  ""Have a good day, everyone.""

  ""And I would like to thank all of you for dialing in."",
  ""In October, as reported, Aethlon's Board of Directors appointed me to serve as the company's permanent Chief Executive Officer."",
  ""I have served as Interim CEO since November 2023, and I look forward to continuing my role on a permanent basis."",
  ""As you know, Aethlon Medical is continuing the research and clinical development of its Hemopurifier, a blood -- a therapeutic blood filtration system designed to bind and remove harmful exosomes and life-threatening viruses from blood and other biological fluids."",
  ""These qualities of the Hemopurifier have important potential applications in oncology, where cancer-associated exosomes may promote immune suppression and metastasis, in life-threatening infectious diseases and in organ transplantation."",
  ""As a reminder, the two goals that I stated were our key objectives when I was appointed to Interim CEO were to move the company forward in oncology and to reduce our expenses in order to streamline operations."",
  ""As you will hear shortly, and as I'm happy to note, we made measurable progress on both of these fronts during the latest quarter and into the current period."",
  ""Specifically, our emphasis on expense reductions has allowed for optimized resource allocation."",
  ""This, in turn, enabled our continued work on the high-impact area of oncology."",
  ""And I'm very pleased to say that we advanced our oncology trial efforts in Australia during the latest quarter and into the current period."",
  ""I'm gratified by this progress and expect that our shareholders will ultimately be rewarded by our efforts."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to Dr. LaRosa, who will give you an update on our oncology program to date, including one important milestone that we recently achieved and on other potential upcoming milestones we expect to report later this calendar year."",
  ""I will try to keep our financial overview brief with a focus on key points."",
  ""For a more detailed analysis, you can refer to the financial statements attached to our  that just hit the wire or in our soon-to-be-filed quarterly report on Form 10-Q. As of September 30, 2024, Aethlon Medical held a cash balance of approximately $6.9 million."",
  ""For the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, our consolidated operating expenses were approximately $2.9 million, which was a decrease from $3.2 million in the same period of 2023."",
  ""This decrease of approximately $300,000 or 9% in the 2024 period was primarily driven by a decrease of approximately $600,000 in professional fees."",
  ""And that was partially offset by an increase of approximately $200,000 in payroll and related expenses and approximately $100,000 increase in general and administrative expenses."",
  ""The approximate $600,000 reduction in professional fees was mainly attributed to several factors, a $300,000 decrease in legal fees following a transition to a new legal firm, a $200,000 drop in contract labor expenses following the completion of projects with contract manufacturing organizations and R&D consultants, and an $81,000 decline in accounting fees."",
  ""The approximate $200,000 increase in payroll and related expenses was largely driven by $500,000 in separation expenses related to severance agreements following the termination of an executive and a workforce reduction."",
  ""However, this increase was partially offset by a $200,000 reduction in ongoing payroll expenses and a $100,000 decrease in stock-based compensation due to completed vesting and expiration of options associated with our reduced head count."",
  ""General and administrative expenses increased by $100,000, mainly due to a $163,000 increase in costs related to our ongoing oncology clinical trial that Steve just discussed."",
  ""That increase was partially offset by a $33,000 reduction in supply expense following the completion of R&D projects, along with a combined $20,000 decrease related to conference and insurance expenses."",
  ""As a result of the factors I just noted, our net loss decreased to approximately $2.8 million in the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2024, from approximately $3 million in the same quarter of 2023."",
  ""Now I would like to note and emphasize that if we exclude the $500,000 provision related to an employee termination, our operating expenses decreased by approximately $700,000."",
  ""We included these earnings results and related commentary in our press release issued this afternoon."",
  ""The release also included the balance sheet for September 30, 2024, and the statements of operations for the three- and six-month periods ended September 30, 2024 and 2023."",
  ""We will file our quarterly report on Form 10-Q following this call."",
  ""Our next  for the fiscal third quarter ending December 31, 2024, will coincide with the filing of our quarterly report on Form 10-Q in February 2025."",
  ""And now, Steve and I would be happy to take any questions that you may have."",
  ""Operator, please open the call for questions."",
  ""Welcome to Aethlon Medical's fiscal second quarter 2025  call."",
  ""My name is Michael Miller with Rx Communications."",
  ""At 4:15 p.m. Eastern Time today, Aethlon Medical released financial results for its fiscal second quarter ended September 30, 2024."",
  ""If you have not seen or received Aethlon Medical's , please visit the Investors page at www.aethlonmedical.com to view it."",
  ""Following this introduction and the reading of the company's forward-looking statement disclaimer, Aethlon's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, James Frakes; and Aethlon's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Steven LaRosa will provide an overview of Aethlon's strategy and recent developments."",
  ""Mr. Frakes will then make some brief remarks on Aethlon's financials."",
  ""We will then open up the call for the Q&A session."",
  ""Before I hand the call over to Mr. Frakes, please note that the news release today and this call contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as amended."",
  ""The company cautions you that any statement that is not a statement of historical fact is a forward-looking statement."",
  ""These statements are based on expectations and assumptions as of the date of this conference call."",
  ""Such forward-looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially from the results anticipated in the forward-looking statements."",
  ""Factors that could cause the results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements can be found under the caption, Risk Factors in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, the company's most recent quarterly report on form 10-Q and in the company's other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission."",
  ""Except as may be required by law, the company does not intend to, nor does it undertake any duty to update this information to reflect future events or circumstances."",
  ""With that, I'll now turn the call over to Mr. James Frakes, Aethlon's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer."",
  ""First, I will discuss our Australian oncology study."",
  ""As most of you will have hopefully seen, earlier this week we announced that the first patient was enrolled at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide, Australia."",
  ""And we are excited to update that now with the enrolment of a second patient from the same hospital."",
  ""This marks a critical milestone for our oncology program and also constitutes great progress in the six months since we announced that we had pre-clinical data to support going forward with the clinical trial."",
  ""Additionally, Pindara Private Hospital in Gold Coast, Australia, is now open for patient enrollment and is actively screening for eligible subjects."",
  ""Going forward, we expect to continue to enroll patients in this safety, feasibility and dose finding trial of the Hemopurifier in patients with solid tumors who fail treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies."",
  ""Two observations would support this."",
  ""One is we're seeing active pre-screening logs from our sites and we are heartened by the fact that patients as indicated by the two we've enrolled, have thought the study interesting enough and important enough to go ahead and sign and form consent to be in the trial."",
  ""We are awaiting full Ethics Board approval from a third Australian hospital located in Sydney."",
  ""The Aethlon team recently visited Australia between the 9th of October and the 16th of October of this year."",
  ""On October 10, we had a site visit with the lab of Prof. Georges Grau at the University of Sydney, who will be performing the central lab extracellular vesicle and T cell studies on samples from patients enrolled in the study."",
  ""On October 11, we had a highly interactive investigator meeting with members of all three Australian sites' clinical research teams."",
  ""This was then followed by individual site visits to all three clinical sites for training on the use of the Aethlon Hemopurifier."",
  ""Also, in the second quarter, we received Ethics Committee approval from Medanta Medicity Hospital in India for a similar 9 to 18 patient safety, feasibility and dose finding trial of the Hemopurifier."",
  ""We've secured a clinical trial agreement with this site as well, and enrollment can proceed once we have regulatory approval for importing of the devices by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, known as the CDSCO."",
  ""As a reminder, the primary endpoint of the approximate 9 to 18 patient safety, feasibility and dose finding trial is safety."",
  ""The trials will monitor adverse events and clinically significant changes in lab tests of Hemopurifier-treated patients with solid tumors with stable or progressive disease at different treatment intervals after a two-month run-in period of the anti-PD-1 therapy, either Keytruda or Opdivo monotherapy."",
  ""Patients who don't respond to the anti-PD-1 antibody therapy will be eligible to enter the Hemopurifier phase of the study, where sequential cohorts will receive either one, two or three Hemopurifier treatments during a one-week period."",
  ""In addition to monitoring for safety, the study is designed to examine the number of Hemopurifier treatments needed to decrease the concentration of extracellular vesicles."",
  ""And if those changes in EV concentrations improve the body's own natural ability to attack tumor cells."",
  ""These exploratory central laboratory analyses are expected to inform the design of a subsequent efficacy and safety trial, including a premarket approval, known as a PMA study required by the FDA and other regulatory agencies."",
  ""Please note that currently only approximately 30% to 40% of patients who receive the anti-PD-1 therapies, pembrolizumab or nivolumab will have a lasting clinical response to these agents."",
  ""EVs produced by tumors, have been implicated in the spread of cancers and the resistance of those agents -- to those agents, the anti-PD-1 therapies."",
  ""The Aethlon Hemopurifier has been designed to bind or remove these EVs from the bloodstream, which may improve these therapeutic response rates to anti-PD-1 antibodies."",
  ""In the preclinical studies I mentioned, the Hemopurifier has been shown to reduce the number of EVs in cancer patient plasma samples."",
  ""The company also continues to explore opportunities to expand the use of the Hemopurifier as a treatment for life-threatening viral infections."",
  ""In vitro, it has shown effectiveness in binding a large library of envelope viruses, including those of recent concern, both domestically and internationally, including Marburg virus, Lassa virus, dengue, SARS-CoV-2 and H5N1 bird flu."",
  ""That said, we believe that we stand poised to respond in the event of an epidemic or outbreak involving an envelope to virus."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call back over to Jim for the financial discussion, and he will then open it up for questions.""
]","[
  ""So I have a few questions, if that's okay."",
  ""I wanted to follow up on the launching, initiating patient enrollment in the study in Australia, which is obviously really exciting now in terms of moving forward."",
  ""So since this is designed to be a basket study, are the first two patients who've enrolled in the study representative of different solid tumor types?"",
  ""And then, so I'm guessing that training the staff and the people who will be involved at the third location in Australia made sense to do because you were visiting Australia anyhow."",
  ""But is it reasonable to think that given that you put the time and effort in to that training process, that the company is highly confident that it will receive Ethics Committee approval at some point near-term?"",
  ""So it sounds like it's really just pretty pro forma at this point."",
  ""And then lastly, can you just remind us of -- and Jim, I think this is probably more for you, but can you please remind us of what the whole rebate procedure is in Australia?"",
  ""Or maybe it's not referred to as a rebate, the 43% tax benefit that you are anticipating."",
  ""Can you remind us of how the process works and what the timing on that will be?"",
  "" for taking my question."",
  ""I'm actually on the line for Anthony Vendetti."",
  ""Just a two quick questions."",
  ""Number one, see, I always thought in the past that the trial for India was actually just going to be part of this trial in Australia."",
  ""But now it seems, reading the press release and on the call, it's a totally separate trial, but has the same safety endpoint."",
  ""So just could you maybe explain a little why the -- why you felt it necessary to hold two trials with the same endpoint?"",
  ""And then going back to the trial in Australia, so you have two sites that are enrolling patients and it seems like a third is really just around the corner."",
  ""And now you have -- you announced the first patient enrollment just a couple of days ago, and now a second."",
  ""Do you have any more better visibility as to when you think you'll conclude enrollment and when we could expect any sort of data from the trial?"",
  ""So is it also safe to say that because you have to have -- you have the two month run-in period where you have to see if the patient responds to the anti-PD-1 treatment that you might actually enroll more patients and then to play it safe?"",
  ""And because hopefully some of them will respond."",
  ""And then for those who don't, so you'll have a larger pool to pull from?"",
  "" for taking my questions."",
  ""I'll hop back in the queue."",
  ""Can you explain to Marla and the shareholders why the radiation – I mean, we're not giving them a dose of radiation... I don't want people to be scared."",
  ""And that is an important financial factor besides the very good medicine and excellent hospitals and principal investigators we're working with."",
  ""So to spur the development of their life science industry, Australia has a 43%, I believe they call it a tax credit."",
  ""But it's actually paid in cash, not as a tax credit as we would call it here in America."",
  ""So it's currently $0.43 on the dollar."",
  ""So any dollar spent in Australia on the projects, one time a year, we can submit the data, and then they cut a check thereafter once it gets through the bureaucracy."",
  ""So it's very attractive that it comes close to cutting the cost in half."",
  ""So we're just going through the submission now."",
  ""For the previous year, there wasn't much to submit because we were just getting going."",
  ""But that should be should be important in future years."",
  ""And we will report after we get the data for each cohort, Jeremy."",
  ""We're not going to wait... until the end -- the true end of the study."",
  "" again for joining us today to discuss our fiscal second quarter results."",
  ""We look forward to keeping you up to date on future calls."",
  ""Yeah, we're excited as well."",
  ""So I'm glad to hear you're excited."",
  ""So both of the patients have two of the tumor types that are described in the inclusion criteria."",
  ""I don't want for the sake of patient privacy, I don't want to divulge a lot of clinical information about the patients."",
  ""But, yeah, they had two representative tumors for people who were treated with anti-PD-1."",
  ""The third site actually was able to piggyback on a prior ethics approval from another site, since it's a central Ethics Committee board in Bellberry."",
  ""So we already actually have the ethics approve -- a contingent Ethics Board Approval."",
  ""We have to add on the radiation assessment."",
  ""So that's how much -- that's what kind of the adding on how much radiation people receive for X-rays has to be updated in there."",
  ""So that's the only No, no."",
  ""So what I mean by the radiation assessment is you have to get -- they want -- what Ethics Boards want to know is how many X-rays do you need just for the sole purpose of being in the study."",
  ""And for this, it's actually literally just a chest X-ray to confirm that your central venous catheter is in the right spot."",
  ""So it's actually very minimal radiation that you receive for radiology just to be in this study."",
  ""But it's -- again, it's a box that the Ethics Committees have to check."",
  ""So we think we're getting there with that third site."",
  ""And again, they're going to be ready to hit the ground running because they've been trained."",
  ""And the central lab we're using is in Australia, too, so we can apply that cost... ...to that credit."",
  ""So with -- when it comes to tumors as well as EV measurements in the population, there are differences in the genetics as well as in the co-morbid illnesses between, say, a population in Australia and in India."",
  ""So we thought it was important to keep those as two discrete data sets and not co-mingle them where there could be some confounding if there are differences in patient populations."",
  ""But the designs, as you say, are the same."",
  ""But we thought it was important to keep the patient population data sets distinct."",
  ""So in terms of -- remember, this is -- it's designed as a sequential escalating cohort study where the first cohort gets one Hemopurifier treatment, the second cohort gets two and the third cohort gets three."",
  ""There's supposed to be at least three completers in those three cohorts."",
  ""But to at least give you a sense of where we are right now."",
  ""So as you said, we've enrolled two patients."",
  ""They've gone through their screening activities."",
  ""There's a number of tests that are done just to confirm that they're eligible after they sign consent."",
  ""So they're in what's called the run-in period, which is a two-month period during which they're getting their anti-PD-1 therapy alone and they're getting EV measurements, extracellular vesicles measurements, and T cell activity measurements."",
  ""And at the end of those two months, if their imaging reveals that their tumor is not improving, if it's stable or progressive disease, then they would get the Hemopurifier treatment."",
  ""So based on the two patients that we have currently, those people would presumably, if they have stable or progressive disease, get dosed with the Hemopurifier in January."",
  ""Now that's when we get our first data in terms of safety, which again is the primary endpoint."",
  ""That would be followed once the whole cohort is done."",
  ""So I'm hoping there's more enrollment in the next -- in this month and next month."",
  ""When we're done with the whole cohort, three months after that we would actually have our first tranche of EV data and T cell data."",
  ""So that would probably bring you out sometime into the summer of next year."",
  ""So that would like -- you're going to get safety, you're going to get safety data first and then there's going to be EV and T cell data to follow."",
  ""And that will be true as we progress to the other cohorts."",
  ""Wait till the end... That's right."",
  ""So we're going to keep it -- for each cohort we're going to keep enrolling until we have sufficient numbers to complete those treatment cohorts with Hemopurifier."",
  ""If you estimate 70% of people don't improve, you're going to have to enroll a few -- probably a few more patients just to fill the cohort.""

  ""It's an honor to be leading Gogoro into the new phase of growth and expansion."",
  ""As Bruce said, Q3 has presented unexpected challenges, but it has also given us an opportunity to reevaluate our business trends and priorities and establish a plan that will take us into a new era for the company that I believe will lead to stronger business fundamentals and increased revenue and growth."",
  ""Before going to our plan, I want to address the Taiwan government inquiry that was initiated this past May."",
  ""Earlier this year, the Taiwan government initiated an inquiry into Gogoro's potential use of imported part in two models."",
  ""We have been working closely with the government to address all of their concerns and will continue to do so."",
  ""Taiwan's Commercial Times reported on October 1st that Taiwan's Industrial Development Administration stated that after a technical review committee examined the submitted documents and conduct a hearing, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Gogoro's VIVA scooter motor controller violated Ministry of Economic Affairs' domestic production subsidy guidelines."",
  ""Gogoro is proud of our Taiwan heritage and the support we have received from our customers, partners and the Taiwan government."",
  ""We have become a technology leader and created an emerging industry in Taiwan that includes more than 10 vehicle makers and nearly 16 vehicles."",
  ""And although we have become a strong brand, we realize that we must return to who we are and get back to our core belief and vision for enabling the mass transition of gas-powered scooters to smart electric Smartscooters."",
  ""At our essence, this is who we want to be and what our battery swapping network was created to do."",
  ""Growing into a mature and execution-oriented business requires a shift in mindset, clear vision and a new level of discipline for how we operate as a business."",
  ""We have strengths to build on and our problems are solvable and in our control."",
  ""Gogoro's next phase of growth must leverage these existing strengths and focus on taking care of our riders, simplifying our business and delivering an unparalleled battery swapping experience."",
  ""As we set expectations for the balance of 2024 and 2025, we are focused on three key areas."",
  ""First, we are focused on establishing a business that can become profitable over time."",
  ""This requires us to focus on revenue growth, be disciplined in our management of costs and intentional with our future investments, controlling costs."",
  ""We have been intentionally overinvesting in innovation for the past decade, but are now establishing a new cost structure."",
  ""Upon my appointment as Interim CEO, we initiated a thorough review of all spending across all aspects of our business and into our 2025 plan."",
  ""Growing revenue through increased investments in the Gogoro Network."",
  ""We are capitalizing on our past R&D investments and transforming our R&D spending to focus on batteries, swapping stations, infrastructure and our second life battery business."",
  ""For example, we recently completed a proof-of-concept with Taipower on an energy storage system that utilized 144 second-life Gogoro batteries to provide UPS energy."",
  ""Second, we are laser-focused on the customer experience of our riders in Taiwan."",
  ""Gogoro's business begins and ends with delighting our customers and we applaud them for being savvier and more demanding than ever."",
  ""We recognize the importance of our energy network and are determined to make our battery swapping and Smartscooter experience the best."",
  ""This goes back to embracing our core beliefs and identifying and consistently delivering an experience that is easier to use, more reliable and affordable."",
  ""We also remain committed to delivering Smartscooters that are fun to ride in all."",
  ""Over the past 10 years, our riders have created an incredible and obsessive community."",
  ""An example of this is our seventh Taipei Bridge rider event early this month that attracted nearly 2,000 riders from all over Taiwan, including Gogoro and GoShare riders as well as Gogoro's partners vehicle riders from Aeon, eMOVING, eReady, Yamaha, PGO and Awayspeed."",
  ""I want to take a moment to extend my heartfelt gratitude to these riders and partners for their community focus and unwavering support and encouragement."",
  ""Third, we are prioritizing key expansion markets."",
  ""Gogoro's thesis remain that two-wheel electrification will happen in all countries over time."",
  ""But every market develops at a different pace depending on a number of factors like government programs and subsidies, fuel and vehicle pricing and other local factors."",
  ""Like our core business in Taiwan, we are also evaluating each of our expansion market businesses and established new cost structures, a more disciplined operation to determine the readiness and the best path forward."",
  ""We want to make sure we are establishing sustainable businesses that drive meaningful growth and have a clear path to revenue growth."",
  ""With that in mind, we are still committed to spending more time and effort to capitalize on growth across our top priority international markets."",
  ""The largest two-wheel market in the world is India, where we have been establishing a beachhead."",
  ""We continue to believe in the future growth of India's EV ecosystem."",
  ""Additionally, we are nearing the completion of our battery pack factory in India and we are developing detailed strategy for market engagement."",
  ""We are seeing large Southeast Asia markets embracing electric two-wheel vehicle in new ways and are working to address these emerging opportunities."",
  ""To this point, our business collaboration and partnership with Castrol remains strong and is continuing as planned."",
  ""Together, both companies are committed to advancing electromobility and innovative energy solution in the region, leveraging Gogoro's expertise in technology and Castrol's vast international experience and leadership."",
  ""The collaboration is focused on developing solutions for electric scooters, enhancing performance and sustainability while supporting Gogoro's expansion goals in both existing and new markets."",
  ""In addition, we currently have a presence in South Korea, Singapore, Nepal, Chile and Colombia."",
  ""I have a clear understanding of where we are and what we need to do differently moving forward."",
  ""And I'm committed to leading Gogoro through this transformation."",
  ""Our entire management team is devoted to reestablishing a strong strategic mission and executing to deliver future value for our customers, partners, investors and employees."",
  ""I'd like to hand it back to Bruce, who will walk through our Q3 financials."",
  ""Welcome to Gogoro's 2024 Q3  call, hosted by our Interim CEO, Henry Chiang; and CFO, Bruce Aitken."",
  ""Hopefully, by now you've seen our ."",
  ""If you haven't, it is available on the Investor Relations tab of our website, investor.gogoro.com."",
  ""We are hosting our  call via live webcast through Gogoro's website, where you can also download all the  materials."",
  ""We will also be displaying the materials on the webcast screen as we go."",
  ""If you're joining us through the conference call, your dial-in lines are in listen-only mode."",
  ""Bruce will begin with an introduction and then Henry will outline our current business and future strategy."",
  ""Bruce will then go into Q3 financial results and then we will open the line for Q&A and answer as many questions as time allows."",
  ""As usual, we would like to remind everyone that today's discussions may contain forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements."",
  ""Please refer to the forward-looking statements that appear in our press release and investor presentation provided today."",
  ""Now I would like to turn the call over to our CFO, Bruce Aitken."",
  "" for joining our call today."",
  ""We're pleased to have this opportunity to meet with you and provide a summary of our third quarter 2024 results."",
  ""Q3 was challenging for Gogoro and our financial performance and stock price were impacted."",
  ""We recently announced our receipt of a Nasdaq Listing Compliance Notice, our CEO's resignation and a government inquiry into our potential use of imported parts in two vehicle models."",
  ""Before we discuss our Q3 business results, we want to update you on each of these three points."",
  ""As you know, Horace Luke resigned as Gogoro's Chairman and CEO on September 13, 2024."",
  ""We appreciate Horace's vision for urban mobility and making Gogoro's battery swapping and vehicles a reality."",
  ""The board responded quickly, appointing Tamon Tseng, Chairman of Ruen Chen Investment Holding Company and the General Counsel of Ruentex Group as Gogoro's new Chairman of the Board."",
  ""The board also appointed Henry Chiang as Interim CEO."",
  ""Prior to his new CEO role, Henry had been at Gogoro for more than six years, where he founded and led our GoShare business and most recently led our Taiwan business."",
  ""According to Nasdaq listing rules, all companies must maintain a $1 per share average closing price of the company's common stock over a consecutive 30-day trading period."",
  ""We were notified of our noncompliance by the Nasdaq on October 29 and issued a press release on November 1st in accordance with Nasdaq requirements."",
  ""Under Nasdaq rules, Gogoro has 180 days to regain compliance by achieving a closing bid price of at least $1 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days."",
  ""This notice has no immediate effect on the listing or trading of the company's shares on Nasdaq, nor does it impact the company's operations or financial status."",
  ""We are fully committed to remaining listed on the Nasdaq and plan to take all necessary steps to regain compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements and to regain shareholder confidence."",
  ""Now I'd like to introduce you to Henry Chiang, Gogoro's Interim CEO, to give you an update on his first two months in his new role and our plans for the future."",
  ""I want to walk you through our Q3 financials, starting with sales in Taiwan."",
  ""We continue to accumulate new subscribers in our Gogoro Network and that business continues to grow in line with subscribers."",
  ""We ended the third quarter with 626,000 accumulated subscribers, up from 570,000 subscribers at the end of Q3 2023."",
  ""And we had $34.9 million in battery swapping service revenue in the third quarter."",
  ""The total number of registered electric scooters in Q3 in Taiwan was 23,837 vehicles, up 14.5% from 20,815 in Q3 2023."",
  ""Gogoro branded vehicle registrations were 15,551, up 1.6% from Q3 2023 and powered by the Gogoro Network vehicle registrations were 16,444, making Gogoro-based vehicles 69% of total electric two-wheel vehicle sales in Q3 2024."",
  ""This electric vehicle registration growth occurred while the overall market for two-wheelers in Taiwan declined by 11.4% versus Q3 of 2023."",
  ""And as we have indicated in previous quarters, we have a backlog of orders for new vehicles, which we anticipate fulfilling in Q4."",
  ""Had we delivered all of those vehicles, the EV two-wheeler market would have grown by 26.5%."",
  ""Based on current expectations for the fourth quarter, we estimate the total powered two-wheel sales in Taiwan in 2024 will be between 780,000 and 810,000 units."",
  ""That's a decline of between 7% and 10% versus 2023 full year registration figures."",
  ""Based on these estimates, we expect Gogoro branded sales to represent approximately 6% to 7% of total market share and total PBGN vehicle market share will be slightly higher than that."",
  ""We've been focused on cost this quarter."",
  ""We're controlling spending effectively as reflected in our reductions in both G&A and R&D expenses, totaling $4.4 million, excluding share-based compensation."",
  ""We're continuing to evaluate all business segments and our international operations for efficiency and we expect to begin implementing further cost savings initiatives during the fourth quarter and during 2025."",
  ""For the third quarter, total revenue was $86.9 million, down 5.3% year-over-year and down 3.4% year-over-year on a constant currency basis."",
  ""Had foreign exchange rates remained constant with the average rate of the same quarter last year, revenue would have been up by an additional $1.8 million."",
  ""We had about 3,800 backlog orders for vehicles in the third quarter and although customers have the right to withdraw those backlog orders before delivery."",
  ""These backlog orders primarily came from customers' robust demand for our new models, coupled with our needs of balancing manufacturing capacity over multiple models and related supply chain resources."",
  ""Battery swapping service revenue for the third quarter was $34.9 million, up 3.8% year-over-year and up 6% year-over-year on a constant currency basis."",
  ""Total subscribers at the end of the third quarter exceeded 625,000, up 9.6% from 570,000 subscribers at the end of the same quarter last year."",
  ""This year-over-year increase in battery swapping service revenue was primarily due to our larger subscriber base compared to the same quarter last year and the high retention rate of our subscribers."",
  ""Sales of hardware and other revenues for the third quarter were $52.0 million, down 10.6% year-over-year and down 8.8% year-over-year on a constant currency basis."",
  ""The year-over-year decrease in sales of hardware and other revenues was driven by a combination of factors: first, a decrease of average selling price due to a higher proportion of sales volume generated from our lower-priced entry-level models; second, a significant increase in the level of undelivered backlog orders compared to the same quarter last year; and third, a decrease in sales revenue associated with selling accessories, parts and performing maintenance services."",
  ""The backlog orders for vehicles we received in the third quarter are not reflected in vehicle registration data provided by the Taiwan government for the third quarter, nor did Gogoro recognize any revenue for these vehicles despite receiving full payment from customers or approved financing from third-party financing companies."",
  ""Gogoro will account for the vehicle revenue upon deliveries to customers."",
  ""The government reported registration volume of powered two-wheelers in the Taiwan market in the third quarter was down 11.4% year-over-year."",
  ""While registrations of total electric-powered two-wheelers were reported to be up by 14.5% compared to the same quarter last year, those of Gogoro's sales volume grew by 1.6%."",
  ""Had we delivered the outstanding backlog orders, Gogoro's year-over-year sales volume growth rate would have been 26.5%."",
  ""For the third quarter, gross margin was 5.4%, down from 18.3% in the same quarter last year, while non-IFRS gross margin was 14.7%, down from 19.2% in the same quarter last year."",
  ""The decline in gross margin was primarily driven by a combination of factors; first, a $2.7 million de-recognition expense on components removed from the battery packs and a $4.9 million cost associated with our battery pack upgrade initiatives; second, a decrease in AST associated with an increase in sales of lower-priced models; third, higher excess capacity costs due to reduced sales volume; fourth, a onetime free upgrade cost for certain vehicle models associated with product warranty in the third quarter of 2024; and fifth, a lower margin contribution from Gogoro OEM parts."",
  ""Gogoro has always viewed ourselves as an energy platform company."",
  ""Every year, we invest heavily in growing and updating our Gogoro Network by deploying new GoStations, new battery packs and new software updates."",
  ""Over the last three years, that investment has been approximately $107 million on an annual basis."",
  ""Additionally, for the last few quarters, we have been undertaking a program to carry out onetime voluntary upgrades on certain battery packs, which are expected to take several quarters to complete, continuing into 2025."",
  ""These upgrades provide multiple benefits, more efficient deployment of our resources than replacing existing battery packs, increased lifetime capacity of each battery pack including extending its first mobility use case and solidifying the extra lifetime capacity of each battery pack to validate our second-life thesis."",
  ""These upgrades are expected to create economic benefits in the long run, but do generate a short-term reduction in our gross margin as we continue carrying out these upgrades."",
  ""We expect our cash position, gross profits and gross margin will continue to be impacted by the cost of these upgrades during 2024 and 2025."",
  ""In order to improve our customers' experience and to extend battery life, we will continue to upgrade a substantial quantity of our battery packs which are already in circulation and we'll continue to improve designs of our battery packs to make them more rugged, long-lasting and to enhance their safety."",
  ""For the third quarter, net loss was $18.2 million, representing an increase of $15.1 million from a net loss of $3.1 million in the same quarter last year."",
  ""The increase in net loss was due to an $11.1 million decrease of the favorable change in the fair value of financial liabilities associated with outstanding earn-out shares, earn-in shares and warrants compared to the same quarter last year and a decrease of $12.1 million in gross profit."",
  ""The increase in net loss was partially offset by the decrease of $7.5 million in operating expenses primarily consisting of a $5.4 million decrease in share-based compensation, a $2.6 million decrease in general and administrative expenses as a result of our cost management efforts and a $1.8 million decrease in research and development expenses and a $3.1 million increase in a customer care package."",
  ""For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA was $14.1 million, representing an increase of $1 million from $13.1 million in the same quarter last year."",
  ""The increase was primarily due to a $5.4 million decrease in operating expenses, excluding share-based compensation and the customer care package associated with various cost savings initiatives and a $1.4 million increase in other net income."",
  ""The increase was partially offset by a $4.8 million decrease in non-IFRS gross profit and a $0.9 million increase in share of loss of investments accounted for using equity method compared to the same quarter last year."",
  ""We continue to generate operating cash flow in the third quarter through tightening our business operations and reducing working capital."",
  ""In the third quarter, we generated an operating cash inflow of $8.5 million, repaid $9.4 million in bank loans and invested $18.8 million in long-lived assets."",
  ""We remain committed to investing in the growth of our battery swapping infrastructure and with $119.2 million in cash, a $55.1 million cash set aside as a temporary surety deposit and the additional credit facilities that are available to us, we believe we have sufficient sources of funding to meet our near-term business growth objectives."",
  ""We will roll out a variety of customer experience enhancement programs over the next 12 months, including battery upgrades, specific vehicle extended warranty programs and software upgrades and others."",
  ""We're developing a series of specific plans to rebuild and realign Gogoro's focus on products and solutions and improve the overall efficiency of our organization."",
  ""These plans, which will be discussed in more detail in the fourth quarter when we've completed our strategies and assessments, will include cost savings in 2025 from improving inventory management and the use of standard components, the lowering of logistics and warehousing costs, reducing warranty costs as vehicle production stabilizes, reducing corporate and manufacturing overheads, streamlining manufacturing capacity and other similar initiatives."",
  ""These initiatives aim to optimize resources, manage risks and improve profitability across operations."",
  ""We expect these initiatives to begin in the fourth quarter of 2024 and extend into 2025."",
  ""We continue to strengthen our internal controls policies and practices over our development and supply chains to enhance compliance with the requirements of local subsidies in all countries that we operate in."",
  ""We are adjusting our revenue expectations for the year to a level lower than previously expected."",
  ""The overall performance of the two-wheeler market in Taiwan is softer than anticipated."",
  ""With the combination of ASP pressure from entry-level models and delays in realizing anticipated international sales in the second half of 2024, we adjust our guidance for full year revenue and are expecting to generate between $305 million to $315 million in 2024."",
  ""We expect our gross margin will be materially negatively impacted in the short term as a result of our ongoing and accelerated battery upgrade initiatives.""
]","[
  "", This is what our battery swapping network was created to do and we have a 3-point plan."",
  ""First, we are focused on establishing a business that can become profitable over time."",
  ""This requires us to focus on revenue growth, be disciplined in our management of cost and intentional with our future investments."",
  ""Second, our business begins and ends with delighting our customers and we are laser-focused on the customer experience of our rider in Taiwan."",
  ""Third, we are prioritizing key expansion markets."",
  "", Gogoro's next phase of growth must leverage the existing strengths and focus on taking care of riders, simplifying our business and delivering an unparalleled battery swapping experience."",
  ""Our business begins and ends with delighting our customers."",
  "" for your support of Gogoro and  for calling into today's call."",
  "", We think the best way to do so is through business fundamentals and we have confidence in our future."",
  ""We have confidence in our management team."",
  ""We're devoted to reestablishing a strong vision and then executing to deliver value for our customers, partners and investors."",
  ""And we trust that in doing so there is a likelihood that the stock price will naturally go back above $1."",
  ""If it does not, then we will have to take inorganic steps to ensure that we go above $1 and remain listed on the Nasdaq."",
  ""You've got to view the Taiwan business as a couple of different businesses."",
  ""Recall that in our Gogoro Network business, our battery swapping business, it's really a business that grows in a very healthy manner year-on-year with accumulating subscribers and it performs according to expectations and it performs very, very well."",
  ""And so that business is healthy."",
  ""That business is doing well."",
  ""As we mentioned in terms of vehicle sales, there's a reduction in the overall Taiwan unit sales and that clearly has a knock-on impact on Gogoro and partner brands."",
  ""In order to ensure that we maintain healthy margins, we're working on a number of different programs, as Henry mentioned."",
  ""We'll do And then below the gross margin level, we're working very hard also on R&D, G&A and overall corporate overhead savings."",
  ""So as mentioned, just in the third quarter alone, we saved $4.5 million between our R&D and our G&A cost savings."",
  ""So our focus is on creating a healthy business."",
  ""Our focus is on looking at the business holistically."",
  ""On a non-IFRS basis in Q3, our gross margin was 14.7%, which we're never satisfied with, but we think is an accurate reflection of how the business is performing right now and we'll seek to continue to perform along those lines."",
  ""The business is, in fact, capital-intensive."",
  ""In Taiwan alone, we've spent approximately $600 million to fully embed our infrastructure into the fabric of how people in Taiwan commute, how they take their kids to school, how they play."",
  ""And so with our over 12,000 racks at 2,500 locations and all the excess batteries required to fulfill the needs of those customers, it really has been a capital-intensive journey up until now."",
  ""As we expand internationally, we've always said we want to do so in a more asset-light way and that's why partnerships are important."",
  ""So we'll be looking to find partners who are willing to help us fund that growth."",
  ""In those large markets, it will be difficult for us to replicate the Taiwan model where we are the sole owner of the battery packs."",
  ""In terms of allowing customers to own batteries, it's not something that we've really done up until now, but we're always open to new business models."",
  ""In theory, someone could use their batteries via the use of an inverter to power their devices at home and those kinds of things."",
  ""It's not something that we've actively pursued."",
  ""But again, we're always open to some new business models."",
  ""So, in India, we have successfully run a couple of pilot programs throughout the first half of the year and up until now."",
  ""We have worked very closely with a number of large potential partners in India to roll out GoStations and to roll out vehicles."",
  ""The data from those pilots has been very informative."",
  ""We're learning a few different things."",
  ""We're learning, obviously, that vehicle price matters a great deal."",
  ""And so we're working to ensure that there are a variety of vehicles, potentially some made by partners, which can help us grow into the Indian market."",
  ""Our battery pack factory is nearing completion."",
  ""It has taken longer than anticipated."",
  ""And so we're continuing to work with a variety of potential partners in India to find ways to grow the market."",
  ""Not too long ago, India's government also released its recent FAME-III follow-on kind of subsidy program."",
  ""And there are some aspects of that program from a battery swapping standpoint that we're working to continue to influence."",
  ""At the moment, there is a little bit of a gap in terms of the subsidies provided for battery charging vehicles versus battery swapping vehicles."",
  ""And having government policy lined up to really support electrification and not only battery charging, but battery swapping electrification, is really important."",
  ""So that's something that we'll continue to work with the India government on."",
  ""India, as Henry said, is the largest two-wheel market in the world."",
  ""And so it's an important market for us."",
  ""But what's really critical is that we find a nuanced way to enter that market and that we find the right locations, the right partners, the right government policy before we seek to really grow fast."",
  ""So at this time, there seems to be no further questions in the queue or online."",
  ""At this time, I will hand the conference back to Henry for a few closing remarks.""

93,3125476,06YF3W-E,2024-11-13,"[
  ""I am extremely proud of the progress we have made in the last quarter."",
  ""As you know, we have been working to develop deramiocel, formerly known as CAP-1002 for the treatment of DMD for the last eight years."",
  ""We have shown in multiple clinical trials the salutary benefits of deramiocel in attenuating the consequences of the skeletal muscle myopathy and improving the cardiomyopathy associated with this devastating disease."",
  ""We have consistently presented the data as it has become available to the FDA and the data has shown clinically meaningful as well as statistically significant improvements."",
  ""Based on the strength of the data as well as the large unmet medical need of the cardiac implications, we have decided, after conferring with the FDA to file a BLA for full approval for the cardiomyopathy associated with DMD."",
  ""To say that we are proud and excited about our progress here is an understatement."",
  ""For the new listeners and supporters of Capricor on this call, I will walk you through some of the developments that have brought us here today and outline the steps Capricor is taking as we position our organization to become a revenue generating commercial stage company should we receive FDA approval for which I am very optimistic."",
  ""Now, first, I'd like to provide a regulatory update."",
  ""2024 has been an extraordinary year for Capricor."",
  ""We have taken the opportunity to work in collaboration with the FDA to prepare for the potential approval and commercialization of deramiocel to treat the cardiomyopathy associated with DMD."",
  ""Our BLA will be based on existing cardiac data from our Phase 2 HOPE-2 and HOPE-2 open label extension clinical studies compared to patient level natural history data from the DMD Cardiac Consortium, led by Dr. Jonathan Soslow at Vanderbilt University."",
  ""I will now take a few minutes to explain how we got to this point from a regulatory perspective."",
  ""As I have stated previously, we have been presenting clinical data as it becomes available to FDA and as part of our pre-BLA meeting in August when we show them the cardiac data from the HOPE-2 open label extension study compared to the natural history dataset, it became clear that deramiocel was slowing the trajectory of cardiac dysfunction in DMD, measured by ejection fraction and measurements of end of systolic and end of diastolic index volumes."",
  ""FDA noted the strength of our data and also noted that there were no approved therapies for cardiomyopathy associated with DMD."",
  ""Based on that meeting and subsequent meetings with FDA, we have decided to move forward to file for full approval."",
  ""The opportunity here is to focus initially on the cardiomyopathy as it addresses a major unmet medical need of those with DMD is supported by significant clinical data."",
  ""And most importantly, it is de-risked in that that data is already available."",
  ""No more clinical data is theoretically necessary and the label for the cardiomyopathy, which I will provide details on the projected economics of in a few minutes, is broad and ultimately will encompass a large proportion of those with DMD."",
  ""Now let me explain the next steps for HOPE-3 Cohort A, which was originally slated to be unblinded by year-end of 2024."",
  ""HOPE-3 was designed to show that deramiocel attenuates upper limb skeletal muscle disease progression."",
  ""And as you may recall, the primary efficacy endpoint of HOPE-3 is the pull or performance of the upper limb 2.0."",
  ""Therefore, the approval based on HOPE-3 will be to treat the skeletal muscle myopathy."",
  ""And while we are pleased thus far with the effect of deramiocel on Upper Limb function, it is not as important for the first indication which will now be cardiomyopathy and which presents a greater initial market opportunity for deramiocel."",
  ""Therefore, we have decided, after conferring with FDA to combine cohorts A and B and use that data to serve as a post-approval supplement and add skeletal muscle myopathy to the label in the future."",
  ""Furthermore, Capricor may elect to use this dataset to support marketing authorization outside of the USA should that be necessary, which we'll have more clarity on in 2025."",
  ""So let me summarize, we are filing for full approval for DMD cardiomyopathy with a substantially de-risked and previously analyzed data."",
  ""We expect to hear from FDA by the end of the first quarter of 2025 regarding the status of the application."",
  ""And if the FDA review goes well, we anticipate a potential PDUFA date set for the second half of 2025."",
  ""We will combine cohort A and B together, increasing the power of the trial and use that data when unblinded to add the treatment of skeletal muscle myopathy to the label."",
  ""It is a clear strategy which gives Capricor the opportunity to achieve potential approval for a first in class treatment for one of the most devastating consequences of DMD."",
  ""I am pleased to report that the first module of the BLA was submitted and we are on track to fully submit our BLA package by year-end 2024."",
  ""I want to thank my team for their extraordinary efforts to this point and reiterate that we are focusing all of our efforts on this endeavor."",
  ""This includes preparations for CMC inspection, pre-commercial activities and market access work with our distribution partner, NS Pharma."",
  ""While we believe that an AdCom may not be necessary, we are preparing internally for that eventuality."",
  ""Now I would like to spend the next few minutes highlighting the patient population we are targeting with this first label."",
  ""Cardiac disease is a standard feature of DMD and most individuals with DMD will eventually have cardiomyopathy."",
  ""For many, the insidious breakdown of cardiac muscle begins very young."",
  ""Some patients will have evidence of cardiac dysfunction before 10 years of age, most by age 16."",
  ""The pathogenesis is not like any standard cardiac disease process and has taken nearly a decade of careful imaging and evaluation to understand why these patients have what appears to be normal cardiac function and then they fall off the cliff, a reduced ejection fraction from which recovery is not likely."",
  ""Please keep in mind there are currently no approved therapies for DMD cardiomyopathy, and the data suggests that standard cardiac medications do not have a significant impact on progression in most cases."",
  ""If approved, we are anticipating that approximately 50% to 60% of the overall DMD population in the United States, or around 8,000 people with DMD, would be eligible for treatment with deramiocel."",
  ""Because deramiocel would be a first in class therapeutic for an aspect of DMD that has no approved medicines, our initial discussions with payers have been very positive."",
  ""We expect reimbursement would be consistent with other recently approved DMD therapies such as exon skippers."",
  ""Our treatment is administered intravenously every three months and is designed to be used chronically to slow cardiac disease progression in those with DMD."",
  ""The opportunity for deramiocel has great promise, both in terms of revenue generation and in treating one of the most devastating aspects of DMD, which is the heart disease."",
  ""If approved, we are anticipating entering the market with approximately 100 patients transferring from open label extension groups to commercial product."",
  ""Based on market research and discussions with advocacy groups, we anticipate rapid adoption of deramiocel."",
  ""We are actively focusing on scaling our manufacturing capacity as well as supporting NS Pharma and working with payers as we prepare for robust patient and physician demand."",
  ""Now let's turn to CMC or chemistry manufacturing and controls."",
  ""Based on those projections of demand, front and center in our mind is preparing for commercial manufacturing in order to meet sales forecast."",
  ""As you know, we manufacture deramiocel in-house at our GMP facility."",
  ""And while we know that our current facility can meet initial demand, we are currently in late stage planning for scaling up manufacturing."",
  ""We built a small commercial manufacturing plant in San Diego to mirror the clinical one in Los Angeles."",
  ""Non-clinical comparability between manufacturing at our San Diego and Los Angeles facilities was achieved which aid in future manufacture expansion activities."",
  ""Our goal is to have another facility online within a year of launch to meet the demand we anticipate."",
  ""Deramiocel is made from transplant qualified human hearts that cannot be used for transplant for technical reasons unless we source across the United States from a consortium of OPOs or organ procurement agencies and a carefully curated process."",
  ""From one heart, we are able to generate thousands of doses of deramiocel."",
  ""Well, not necessary at this time, product development activities are underway to increase the yield further."",
  ""The product is manufactured on a modular basis with each individual clean room capable of deramiocel production."",
  ""Our operations team at Capricor is experienced in building, staffing and qualifying these clean rooms so we can continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities to meet demand."",
  ""The clinical shelf life of the frozen products is currently five years, so we are able to stockpile doses in order to meet increasing demand clinically and commercially."",
  ""Currently, as we reported last quarter, our San Diego manufacturing facility is fully operational and actively underway, generating doses."",
  ""In addition, we are also actively preparing for pre-licensing inspection, otherwise referred to as PLI and anticipate that being a successful endeavor."",
  ""Please stay tuned for more color on these important milestones as they become available."",
  ""Now turning to the corporate and commercial front."",
  ""In October, we completed an oversubscribed public offering of common stock raising approximately $86 million, with participation from some of the top healthcare funds in the world."",
  ""We believe this institutional validation was fundamental to our story and a testament to the scientific development at this point."",
  ""I am very appreciative of our new investors in this deal, as well as our legacy shareholders who have positioned themselves as strong supporters of Capricor throughout our history."",
  ""Factoring this raise and our Q3 cash balance, we have approximately $165 million in cash, which gives us a strong runway into 2027."",
  ""These funds will be used to expand our manufacturing capabilities, the plans for which are already underway for a new facility and will also be used to enhance our management and commercial operations team to support a successful launch."",
  ""Nippon Shinyaku is fully engaged with Capricor as we prepare for potential launch."",
  ""Their team in the United States is comprised of 125 people with market access, reimbursement, medical affairs and advocacy programs actively preparing for the launch of deramiocel."",
  ""We continue to work in close collaboration with them."",
  ""Furthermore, earlier this quarter, we entered into a term sheet with Nippon Shinyaku for the marketing, sales and distribution of deramiocel in the European region, subject to finalization of a definitive agreement."",
  ""If this agreement is executed, it will be similar to the US agreement."",
  ""Based on our current agreements with Nippon Shinyaku, if we enter into a definitive agreement for the European region on the anticipated terms, we would have the potential for milestone payments totaling $1.5 billion payable to Capricor."",
  ""In addition, in the US, we are entitled to between 30% to 50% of revenue share based on sales of the product inclusive of cost of goods sold."",
  ""This capital will continue to fuel future product development, strengthen our commercial organization and enable us to build the organization into a world class revenue generating cash flow positive company with a commercial product on the market and a robust pipeline of expansion opportunities leveraging cell and exosome based therapeutics."",
  ""In addition, and as we have been guiding, we are now actively exploring the opportunity to potentially expand into Becker muscular dystrophy with deramiocel as the cardiac manifestations are very similar to that of DMD."",
  ""We continue to believe in deramiocel's potential to be a transformational treatment for DMD cardiomyopathy and beyond."",
  ""And our current plan is to make indication expansion an important goal for 2025."",
  ""Now, I'd like to give you a little bit of an update on our exosomes program."",
  ""While our primary focus has been on advancing deramiocel, we remain committed to our StealthX exosome platform technology as part of our next generation drug delivery platform."",
  ""We have been planning to build a pipeline of exosome products which are engineered to enhance drug delivery and can be targeted."",
  ""We are able to capitalize on our years of building cell based products with the goal of bringing exosomes to the clinic."",
  ""Our program focuses on the use of our StealthX technology developed here at Capricor, which will allow us to develop therapeutics and vaccines by harnessing exosomes as delivery vehicles."",
  ""The goal is not only to have efficacious products which are created delivery vehicle that can outperform a lipid nanoparticle and also be cost effective."",
  ""We have achieved this goal in pre-clinical studies and we can now focus on translating these fundamental properties into therapeutic opportunities."",
  ""We recently presented pre-clinical data showing that a PMO can be loaded into our StealthX platform and targeted using a TFR moiety on the surface for enhanced exon skipping."",
  ""We also have been able to show life extending enzyme replacement and in ARG1 knockout mouse using nanogram doses approaching suggesting successful uptake and utilization of the protein."",
  ""We are planning for an IND for a therapeutic exosome program based on some of this exciting data."",
  ""Please stay tuned for more updates on this front."",
  ""Regarding our StealthX vaccine, we are collaborating with the United States government's Project NextGen, which aims to test vaccine candidates for COVID-19 prevention and to prepare for future pandemics."",
  ""Currently, our StealthX vaccine candidate is in the manufacturing phase with plans to deliver to NIAID, which is the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease in the first quarter of 2025."",
  ""The NIAID will then conduct and fully fund a Phase 1 clinical trial."",
  ""We expect to have some preliminary data available in the second quarter of 2025 subject to NIAID's evaluation."",
  ""Further if NIAID decides that our vaccine meets their criteria for safety and efficacy, they will consider further support for Phase 2 study."",
  ""This presents a tremendous opportunity to generate proof of concept first in human safety and efficacy data."",
  ""And we see this collaboration as a chance to showcase the power of our exosome platform for the broader scientific and business development communities."",
  ""To remind you, the StealthX vaccine platform will not only serve as a clinical proof of concept for the StealthX technology, but our vaccine is comprised of native proteins and not reliant on mRNA, which enables us to rapidly adapt approaching to a new pandemic or to changes in viral epitopes."",
  ""If successful, our vaccine would continue, combine the speed and adaptability of mRNA vaccines with the known greater efficacy of protein vaccines."",
  ""Further, our vaccine uses no adjuvant."",
  ""Recently, there has been much ado about the potential toxicity of certain adjuvant in existing vaccines."",
  ""In conclusion, this has been a transformational quarter for Capricor."",
  ""We've made significant strides in our regulatory pathway, getting closer to potential approval of deramiocel."",
  ""Patients and families are fully supportive of our efforts and see the lasting power of deramiocel and in helping those with DMD to feel and function better."",
  ""Our recent financing has ensured our path forward to execute on our milestones for the foreseeable future."",
  ""Over the next several months, we will be presenting at various medical, scientific and investor related conferences, including the Piper Sandler Global Healthcare Conference and the Oppenheimer Rare Disease Mover Day."",
  ""Most importantly, we are on track to complete the submission of our BLA later this year."",
  ""Finally, I want to thank the patients, their families and our investors for their continued support."",
  ""Capricor's goal is to continue to meet its milestones and deliverables as we have set for it."",
  ""As we continue to focus our efforts on bringing deramiocel with potential commercialization and are investing judiciously across the organization to prepare for that endeavor."",
  ""I will now turn the call over to AJ Bergmann to run through our financials."",
  ""Before we start, I would like to state that we will be making certain forward-looking statements during today's presentation."",
  ""These statements may include statements regarding, among other things, the efficacy, safety and intended utilization of our product candidates, our future R&D plans, including our anticipated conduct and timing of preclinical and clinical studies, our enrollment of patients in our clinical studies, our plans to present or report additional data, our plans regarding regulatory filings, potential regulatory developments involving our product candidate, revenue and reimbursement estimates, projected terms of definitive agreements, manufacturing capabilities, potential milestone payments, our financial position and our possible uses of existing cash and investment resources."",
  ""These forward-looking statements are based on current information, assumptions and expectations that are subject to change and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements."",
  ""These and other risks are described in our periodic filings made with the SEC, including our quarterly and annual reports."",
  ""You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we disclaim any obligation to update such statements."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Linda Marbán, CEO."",
  ""This afternoon's press release provided a summary of our third quarter 2024 financials on a GAAP basis."",
  ""You may also refer to our quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which we expect to become available shortly and will be accessible on the SEC website as well as the financial section of Capricor's website."",
  ""Let me start with our cash position."",
  ""As of September 30, 2024, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled approximately $85 million."",
  ""Subsequent to September 30, 2024, we completed a public offering of common stock for approximately $80.8 million in net proceeds."",
  ""On a pro forma basis, after accounting for the net offering proceeds, our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities would total approximately $166 million."",
  ""Turning to the financials, revenues for the third quarter of 2024 were approximately $2.3 million, compared with approximately $6.2 million for the third quarter of 2023."",
  ""The source of the revenue is the ratable recognition of the $40 million that we have received from our US exclusive Commercialization and Distribution Agreement with Nippon Shinyaku."",
  ""Moving now to our operating expenses, for the third quarter of 2024, excluding stock based compensation, our research and development expense was approximately $11 million compared to approximately $9.5 million in Q3 2023."",
  ""Turning now to G&A, excluding stock based compensation was approximately $2.2 million in Q3 2024 and approximately $1.8 million in Q3 2023."",
  ""Net loss for the third quarter of 2024 was approximately $12.6 million, compared to a net loss of approximately $6.4 million for the third quarter of 2023 and net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was approximately $33.4 million, compared to a net loss of approximately $21.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023."",
  ""I will now open up the line for questions.""
]","[
  ""And I'm really excited to be on the call and congrats on all the progress."",
  ""Can you hear me okay?"",
  ""And congrats on all the progress."",
  ""So I wanted to get a sense, obviously, there is a lot to do behind the scenes here with the filings and with the regulatory approval that you're seeking with the FDA."",
  ""What are you and Nippon Shinyaku doing to prepare this market and to get ready for launch?"",
  ""And I guess coupled in that question is, you mentioned some of the work that you're doing on the manufacturing front, how can you also sort of prepare to scale up to meet that potential commercial demand?"",
  "" so much for taking my question."",
  ""Hey, great to see all the progress and two questions from us."",
  ""Just teeing off from Ted's question about expanding manufacturing."",
  ""Just wanted to drill in a bit further, particularly given the potentially European option for commercialization."",
  ""You could have many more patients you could serve with deramiocel."",
  ""So as we think about your capabilities for serving the market with your current manufacturing versus what you might be able to do as you build out, how should we think about that as it runs along in parallel to what could be Japan, as well as European approvals in the not too distant future?"",
  ""And once you have the cardiomyopathy label in hand and you're pursuing a label expansion with skeletal muscle improvement in the upper limb, I'm just wondering since these children who were affected by DMD tend to get cardiomyopathy by the age of 10 or not that much beyond."",
  ""And you, Linda, had expected that 50% to 60% maybe addressable by the products."",
  ""What would be the incremental gain, I guess, to commercial size that you would get from having an expanded label?"",
  ""Or is that somewhat academic since presumably the cardiomyopathy label would be sort of the large factor here?"",
  ""And then lastly, just a quick one off your second half 2025 guidance for the approval that captures what could be a priority review or center review."",
  ""But presumably, given your RMAT designation you would generally expect to have further review, did you request it – did you need to request Great."",
  "" so much for taking the question."",
  ""This is Rick Miller on for Kristen and  for taking our questions."",
  ""And maybe just first, thinking about the world muscle data you presented, what constitutes a clinically meaningful benefit on cardiac function like left ventricular ejection fraction, specifically in the more severe patients with a baseline LVEF under 45%."",
  ""And how does this relate to what you saw in this subset in that dataset?"",
  ""And maybe just a follow up from that, from a patient journey perspective, can you kind of help us to better understand how these patients are monitored for cardiac decline?"",
  ""Do they undergo cardiac MRI often?"",
  ""And what age are physicians starting to think about seriously monitoring cardiac function in DMD patients?"",
  ""And is this something that you think the field could do better if there is an approved therapy?"",
  ""Congratulations with the progress this quarter, but a couple of questions that I want to ask."",
  ""So first, a commercial question."",
  ""So you still have several geographies that you have involved license, China, South America, rest of the world, Eastern Europe, Australia."",
  ""So what happens is that if some patients from this regions would like to have a drug, so would you sell it directly or you would sell it through your partner?"",
  ""And another question I have is about potential label opportunities for deramiocel."",
  ""So would you expect any limitations in terms of using a after gene therapy so exon skippers on the label or you would think that FDA will give you sort of open label and leave it to physicians, how are they going to use it?"",
  ""Would you expect AdCom based on your conversations and based on what you've seen with prior Duchenne drugs, would you expect the advisory committee meeting?"",
  ""Another question I have is about HOPE-3 readout potential in the future."",
  ""So just a sort of commercial question, do you think the HOPE-3 readout or potential label change will add actual dollars to deramiocel sales, given that, as you said, this 100% of DMD patients have cardiomyopathy, so everyone will be eligible."",
  ""So do you think they will read out with actual add dollar sales to potential future sales of deramiocel?"",
  ""And the last one from me."",
  ""So can we discuss your development plans for 2025?"",
  ""I know you are in a sort of difficult situation now, you've got the cash right now $165 million or so, you'll sell your PRV it's almost $150 million, then you have a milestone payment from Nippon."",
  ""So basically, this does actually give you opportunity to develop something on the own and I think we've discussed in the past that you may have a trial in Becker muscular dystrophy."",
  ""So could we talk a little bit about this, about potential trial design?"",
  ""Would you design it as HOPE-2, et cetera, if you could elaborate a little bit on this?"",
  "" so much for taking questions and congrats on the progress."",
  ""Always great to hear from you."",
  ""So in terms of your first question was what's going on with Nippon Shinyaku."",
  ""So one of the advantages of our deal with Nippon Shinyaku and NS Pharma US branch is that they are already on the market with Viltepso, which is exactly penetrating into the same basic community Duchenne muscular dystrophy."",
  ""So they already have a sales team, a med affairs team, a market access team, a reimbursement team that has already gone ahead and done this with Viltepso."",
  ""So it really is just a plug and play model."",
  ""They have a team of about 125 people specifically now working almost primarily on preparing launch of deramiocel."",
  ""And so these are seasoned pharma executives that have been carefully curated and prepared for this role."",
  ""Now, Capricor has joined in on the fact that we know CAP-1002 or deramiocel better than anybody else."",
  ""So now we have put several of our people basically into the daily mix with Nippon Shinyaku to make sure that deramiocel is rooted in the launch the way that it's supposed to, so that the product is ready, delivery is ready, the centers are ready."",
  ""All of the bells and whistles have been managed."",
  ""Market access has been assessed."",
  ""KOLs have been brought on board."",
  ""Physicians are ready to prescribe it."",
  ""It is all underway at this time and regular standard meetings and opportunities."",
  ""So that's going great and we have great opportunities ahead for launch."",
  ""In terms of your second question with manufacturing, we've been preparing for this day for a long time."",
  ""So we started thinking about the commercialization of deramiocel, let's call it a decade ago when we entered into the clinic."",
  ""And so we knew what we had to do."",
  ""The good thing is that we have done is we have kept manufacturing in-house all this time."",
  ""So it's a de-risked manufacturing procedure because nobody knows it better than we have."",
  ""When we built the San Diego manufacturing facility, it's small, but it's commercial scale, so we know exactly how to do it."",
  ""We've been preparing for PLI really for about two years since we designed and opened that facility."",
  ""So that one is ready to go."",
  ""We have high confidence that we should be able to pass inspection."",
  ""And now because we are anticipating great adoption of deramiocel by Duchenne patients, we're also planning and executing a build out of a new manufacturing facility."",
  ""But again, the nice part of this is that it's not like a gene therapy where the manufacturing for scale up is much more complicated, exponentially more difficult, trying to deal with empty corpses."",
  ""This is a modular plug and play manufacturing paradigm where we just add more cleanrooms to the mix."",
  ""So instead of two clean rooms, we have 8 or 10 or 20 or 100 and we have a great experience with this."",
  ""So overall, I think we're in pretty good shape working on and getting ready for market."",
  ""So again, this has all been in the planning for a while."",
  ""The facilities that we are building and manufacturing in San Diego will be capable of serving the European community as well as the Japanese community."",
  ""We have paradigms in place for shipping already set up and are working with European authorities as we speak in order to get ready for penetration into the European market."",
  ""So all of this was factored into our thinking regarding manufacturing, scaling up and as part of the planning for the expansion of deramiocel into global markets."",
  ""Great to hear from you."",
  ""And that's a really important question."",
  ""And I'd like to address on several levels."",
  ""One, 100% of the people with DMD get cardiomyopathy."",
  ""It is not related to the progression of the skeletal muscle myopathy so you find sometimes little kids very young, sometimes seven years of age, with pretty significant heart disease, with preserved skeletal muscle function, and conversely, you'll sometimes find older guys with pretty attenuated skeletal muscle function, with good preservation of cardiac function."",
  ""And this has been observed sort of throughout the time of evaluation of cardiac function in Duchenne muscular dystrophy."",
  ""So we think the TAM for the cardiomyopathy will be our broadest possible label."",
  ""It's really the reason that we're so excited about this opportunity, in addition to the fact that it's essentially de-risked with already available clinical data."",
  ""But we really think that it spreads across the life course of those with Duchenne also opens the opportunity for other skeletal muscle myopathy – I mean, other muscular dystrophies such as Becker muscular dystrophy or myotonic dystrophy and other ones that have cardiomyopathy as a feature."",
  ""To go to your other question regarding the increase in market size with the skeletal muscle label, it is possible, theoretically and perhaps practically that somebody would need deramiocel to attenuate skeletal muscle dysfunction if they have relatively preserved cardiac function."",
  ""As I've said, there are those outliers."",
  ""And so we would then scoop those in under the expanded label."",
  ""But in reality, the cardiomyopathy label is quite broad and we're quite happy with it as our potential first indication."",
  ""It's part of the RMAT so it comes with the RMAT designation."",
  ""So we are expecting a priority review and are building our timelines around and we don't see that that's going to be an issue."",
  ""Yeah, really good and important question again, so  Rick for asking it."",
  ""So we saw improvement in all of the patients in the HOPE-2 open label extension treated with deramiocel."",
  ""What we found is that those that had more attenuated cardiac function below 45%, the improvement was less than those that had above 45%."",
  ""The theory and rationale for that is that there is more scar, more damaged tissue in the later stage patients with reduced ejection fraction below 45% so there's less cardiac muscle to preserve and to recruit in order to sustain cardiac function."",
  ""But all patients showed a benefit."",
  ""So while we think that greater than 45% is extremely important in terms of marketing because we want to get in these kids young, let's get it into them and let's keep their cardiac function high because unequivocally we saw benefits in those patients that were above 45%."",
  ""So the take away from the World Muscle Society data is very clear, which is let's get deramiocel started early and young and let's preserve that cardiac muscle and cardiac function while they have it."",
  ""So actually that's very true."",
  ""So I'm going to start at the end of your question, because it's so important to cardiologists that we're working with them, we have the benefit of working with the real leaders in the space."",
  ""And we have for a while and have been part of sort of the development of the ethos around developing a treatment for the cardiomyopathy because we are currently farthest ahead of developing a therapeutic for the cardiomyopathy associated with Duchenne."",
  ""So yes, the answer to your last question is yes, we think that the approval of deramiocel will actually accelerate measurements and aggressive treatment of the cardiac disease associated with Duchenne."",
  ""To that end, we plan not only on marketing to cardiologists who may or may not be involved in early stage of care, but to the pediatric neurologists, the rehab med docs, even some of the pediatricians, so that they are aware of the signs and symptoms of cardiac dysfunction."",
  ""Now, what we know is that many of these kids have silent cardiac disease until they're pretty old."",
  ""So let's go back to the beginning of your question, which is how is it going to be monitored and determined?"",
  ""What is the patient's journey?"",
  ""So now most kids get an MRI before the age of 10, cardiac MRI to evaluate cardiac function and structure."",
  ""And what we're doing is we're sort of beginning to build the idea that it can be the start of deramiocel would be based on either aggregation of cardiac scar, you've got some scar in your heart."",
  ""And if you ask the cardiologist how much scar is enough to start treatment, they say any."",
  ""So any cardiac scar in the heart would trigger treatment with deramiocel on a quarterly basis for life or and so it could be both cardiac dysfunction so that ejection fractions that start to drop below 55%."",
  ""Those kids are starting to show evidence that there's something not quite right in the heart."",
  ""Remember, these kids are not typically as active as a typical kid."",
  ""So a drop in injection fraction signals, cardiac dysfunction and so either or both the measurement of scar, the measurement of cardiac dysfunction, which could by MRI or echo, would be a trigger to start deramiocel on that patient journey."",
  ""Now, how physicians go about prescribing it will be up to us and NS Pharma to educate them, to be aware that this exists as a treatment that not only has been shown to be effective, but there are literally no side effects can be given four times a year for life and can be used in conjunction with any and all cardiac medications, steroids and any of the therapies for skeletal muscle myopathy."",
  ""So it's a win-win for everybody to get a patient started on deramiocel."",
  ""So, currently Nippon Shinyaku has rights to sell market and distribute in Europe, the United States and Japan."",
  ""All other areas of the world are still owned by Capricor."",
  ""And so our current plan would be to market directly."",
  ""Our current conversations with FDA have encompassed some of those questions, and the current guidance that we have is that the use of deramiocel would be independent of any of the other therapeutics available, gene therapies or exon skippers."",
  ""We have had people in our clinical trials that have gotten exon skippers."",
  ""We have people in our clinical trials that have received gene therapy."",
  ""And so our current guidance is that we would use it in an open fashion available to anybody with DMD cardiomyopathy."",
  ""I can't – there are no tea leaves to read, but I can tell you that our relationship with FDA has been extremely collaborative."",
  ""They seem favorable to receiving the data."",
  ""I'm sure they'll evaluate the data with all of the seriousness with which we provide it."",
  ""It's a strong data package using natural history data of age and function matched patients."",
  ""We have strong open label extension data."",
  ""Cardiac data, as I've said in multiple venues, cannot be pretended to be better or wished away."",
  ""So there's a lot of objectivity implied in the data itself."",
  ""So I don't think we'll need an AdCom, but we are preparing for an AdCom should we need one and we will be ready for that become an eventuality."",
  ""Well, I guess the answer to that question is any patient that we can treat would add dollars, right."",
  ""So if there's a patient that either a physician thinks would benefit because of the skeletal muscle myopathy and may have missed the cardiac opportunity, that patient would roll in and bring in dollars or in any other way that we can expand the opportunity to expand the label, it's beneficial for any therapeutic."",
  ""So yes, I do think it would be beneficial on some level, but I also think that the opportunity to be the first in class only treatment approved for the cardiomyopathy and in situations where 100% of the kids get it and it's life attenuating gives great opportunity not only for an expanded TAM, but also to really encourage payers to cover the expense for that."",
  ""So it's not another skeletal muscle therapeutic."",
  ""It's really the only thing to be able to treat the cardiac disease."",
  ""So, one of our goals has been to begin to discuss Becker with the agency, our KOLs, especially our cardiology KOLs, tell us that Becker cardiomyopathy is completely indistinguishable from Duchenne cardiomyopathy."",
  ""So if you haven't hand them an MRI, they can't tell if it's a Becker patient or a Duchenne patient."",
  ""And furthermore, the Becker cardiomyopathy starts very young."",
  ""These guys live longer and have better skeletal muscle so dealing with their cardiac disease is very important for them as well."",
  ""We don't want their life to be attenuated or shortened in any way based on the cardiac disease."",
  ""In terms of trial design, I can't answer that question yet."",
  ""We are now working with the key opinion leaders, working with the agency, working with our own regulatory team in order to design the trial that is necessary to get this across the line."",
  ""We anticipate it could be a very small clinical trial that would just add a little bit to the database of knowledge."",
  ""But I don't have clarity and probably won't until after the first quarter."",
  ""I just would like to say  very much for joining today's call."",
  ""We look forward to updating all of you on our progress as we continue through 2024."",
  ""Have a nice evening and stay safe out there.""

  "" very much for the financial overview, Randall."",
  ""I am very proud of our 50% year-over-year growth and our ability to maintain EBITDA positivity on our path to profitability."",
  ""The third quarter has always been an interesting one for us historically."",
  ""Since two of the months, July and August, are late summer months, we tend to see some seasonality with slowing in order flow."",
  ""Then, come September, there's a flurry of activity, and we work very hard to take care of our customers and close This year was no different and we did see approximately CAD 600,000 of business fall into the fourth quarter."",
  ""This only reassures us and solidifies the statement that we will have a great fourth quarter as it's historically been the strongest sales quarter of the year and because of that, our second half of the year will be stronger than our first."",
  ""Regarding our Benchtop NMR products business, we currently sell into some of the largest enterprises in the world, including pharmaceutical, chemical and electronics."",
  ""We also sell into government labs and universities globally."",
  ""What we are seeing is the proliferation of acknowledgement that NMR is the gold standard in testing."",
  ""Because of the utility of the size of our Benchtop products, the use cases and applications are rapidly expanding."",
  ""We are seeing our sales expand horizontally among our recurrent customers."",
  ""For example, Because of our increasing visibility and the expanding market opportunity, we continue to invest in the next generation platform technology and products, which we'll launch in 2025."",
  ""These new products will help us gain market share relative to competitors, succeed at the aforementioned horizontal penetration within enterprise customers and open up more vertical market partnering opportunities."",
  ""In the area of MRI and medical imaging, we booked another large medical imaging sale in the quarter to a customer in Europe."",
  ""Going forward, shareholders should know that this business, although with tremendous opportunities for a future growth, can and will continue to be lumpy."",
  ""We continue to seek new partnering opportunity to sell our MRI console, as well as large custom MRI projects."",
  ""Areas of opportunity include neonatal and guided radiation therapy."",
  ""As mentioned in our press release, as we evolve, it is likely that we will reduce efforts selling other companies' products and, eventually, focus entirely on sales of our own proprietary products and services, where margins are higher and the competitive barriers to entry are also higher."",
  ""Regarding the specific investment in Quad Systems AG and the high-field NMR market opportunity, Quad is having some initial success in their go-to-market strategy and expects 2025 to be an exciting year for them."",
  ""We leverage our software and electronics platform technology by providing Quad with a high-field NMR console, which is a critical module in their overall NMR system."",
  ""We are also developing customer leads and building a sales pipeline with Quad as part of our distribution agreement with the company, which gives us the right to sell high-field NMR products in several territories."",
  ""As we have previously stated, we remain 43% owners of the company, hold two seats on the board of directors."",
  ""Quad Systems have been in need of some more capital to fund their go-to-market strategy, and I'm pleased to report that very recently, they had made some progress in that regard, and I'll provide more color on this in future quarters as I come to fully understand the associated ramifications, which, I anticipate, will be overall positive for Nanalysis Scientific."",
  ""There are tremendous synergies that exists between Quad and Nanalysis."",
  ""My original objectives associated with Quad Systems have not changed, and we see a strong future in high-field NMR."",
  ""Regarding third party equipment sales, first of all, as a reminder, this is predominantly the reselling of Agilent scientific instrumentation, but also includes other equipment manufacturers."",
  ""This has been a steady, consistent business for us that provides incremental revenue and has historically allowed us to knock on more doors of customers that we also target for our proprietary products."",
  ""While the margins are good, we are not able to control over the growth the way we would with our own proprietary products."",
  ""Therefore, as previously alluded to, this will be less of a focus for us in the years to come."",
  ""Turning now to our growing services business, the CAD 160 million CATSA contract continues to progress both from a billing and margin perspective."",
  ""As a reminder, we took full control of all 89 airports in Q1 of this year."",
  ""I'm very encouraged that the margins are up 18% year-over-year."",
  ""A lot of this was due to the shedding of the initial training and credentialing costs, but Randall and our team have done an incredible job of focusing on efficiencies as well."",
  ""The mix between scheduled maintenance, unscheduled maintenance and project work will shift quarterly, but will continue to provide a consistent balance of billing."",
  ""As we continue to see progress with this contract, we will gain efficiencies with the service mix and we do expect to see increased margin growth through the remainder of 2024 and 2025."",
  ""While this CATSA contract remains our largest source of service revenue, it is not our only source, and our objective is to grow this overall service business."",
  ""There are also clear synergies with our magnetic resonance products business, and we'll look forward to leveraging in the future for product sales and expansion In summary, with the majority of the year complete and the visibility that we now have, I continue to be very encouraged about the direction of our business as we finish 2024 and head into 2025."",
  ""I expect Q4 to be very strong."",
  ""As highlighted earlier, we have made excellent progress on a cumulative and year-over-year basis."",
  ""We continue to record company-wide positive EBITDA as we work our way towards profitability, which is our explicit goal."",
  ""As our large service contract has transitioned from cash burn to gross profit contribution and growth, we continue to refine and look for margin expansion."",
  ""This contract will provide us with sticky recurring revenue for years to come."",
  ""Our Benchtop NMR business is just scratching the While we focus on growth, a point that both Randall and I have continued to make is we will stay operationally focused and work to continually drive down costs by looking for efficiencies and simply asking the question: how can we do this better?"",
  ""Finally, I do want to thank our incredible team here at Nanalysis Operator, I'd now like to open up the call for questions."",
  "", operator, and welcome, everyone, to Nanalysis Scientific's third quarter 2024 conference call."",
  ""Before we begin, I would like to remind everyone that our remarks and responses to your questions today will contain forward-looking statements that are based on the current expectations of management."",
  ""These assumptions involve inherent risks and uncertainties that could cause the actual results to differ materially from our responses."",
  ""Certain material factors and assumptions were considered and applied in making forward-looking statements."",
  ""These risk factors are included in our filings for the year ended December 31, 2023."",
  ""Forward-looking statements on this call may include, but are not limited to, statements and comments with respect to future growth of the company's business, the ability to graduate to a senior exchange, the company's acquisition strategy, the ability to develop future products and the possible associated results."",
  ""The company's actual performance and financial results in the future could differ materially from any estimates or projections of future performance implied by the forward-looking statements."",
  ""The forward-looking statements made on this call speak only as of today, and Nanalysis Scientific assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking information as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as expressly required by applicable law."",
  ""For additional information, I do encourage everyone to review our public filings and press releases, which are posted on the SEDAR's filings system, and that's at www.sedarplus.ca."",
  ""On the call with me today are Nanalysis' Founder and CEO, Mr. Sean Krakiwsky; and Nanalysis' CFO, Mr. Randall McRae."",
  ""So, with that, I would like to turn the call over to the Nanalysis' CFO, Randall McRae."",
  ""It's a pleasure to join and speak with everyone on the call today."",
  ""I'll now dive into the financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2024."",
  ""All amounts referenced are in Canadian dollars."",
  ""Financial highlights for the three months ended September 30, 2024 include, for the three months ended September 30, 2024, the company reported consolidated revenue of CAD 10.6 million, an increase of CAD 3.5 million or 50% from the comparative period in 2023."",
  ""Gross margin percentage on product sales was 52% versus 41% for the three months ended September 30, 2023."",
  ""Improvement in gross margin percentages for Benchtop NMR is materializing as sales improved in the second half of last year and manufacturing cost reductions started in 2023 and continued in 2024, positively affecting margins."",
  ""Security service gross margin percentage in the quarter was 15% versus negative 3% in the prior year comparative period as the company completed full transition of 100% of airports service to its control from the incumbent provider in the first quarter of 2024 and expects to continue to increase revenue and drive efficiency within this business through 2024 and into 2025."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended September 30, 2024 was CAD 264,000 versus an adjusted EBITDA loss of CAD 1.4 million in the same period last year."",
  ""This improvement was driven by increased product sales, full transition of airports to the company's control, resulting in increased security services revenue, and the effect of cost reduction initiatives put in place beginning in 2023 and continued into 2024."",
  ""Net loss for the three months ended was CAD 1.6 million as compared to the three months loss for September 30, 2023 of CAD 6.3 million."",
  ""In the prior year, the company recognized a onetime charge of CAD 2.8 million related to the loss of control on its Quad subsidiary in the third quarter."",
  ""The company had approximately CAD 223,000 cash on hand, and undrawn credit facility of CAD 2.1 million and working capital of CAD 4 million as of September 30, 2024."",
  ""We're happy to see continued strength in our financial performance this quarter."",
  ""Our year-over-year revenue numbers reflect significant growth in product sales and strong consistent billings in our services."",
  ""I'm very pleased with our margin improvements, as this has been a large focus of our work and efforts over the past year."",
  ""Our product sales margins were up 10% to 52% from the previous year, and services were up 18% from a negative 3% margin the year before."",
  ""We believe that we can continue to improve these margins and that will contribute to our While our current results have enabled us to continue to achieve EBITDA positivity, we still need to keep our heads down and focused."",
  ""We're continually evaluating other fixed cost reductions to further increase annualized cost savings and work to reach profitability."",
  ""With that, I'll turn the call over to our Founder and CEO, Mr. Sean Krakiwsky.""

  ""This is Max Czmielewski calling in for Stefan Quenneville."",
  ""Congratulations on another strong quarter."",
  ""My first question is just on Benchtop NMR, stronger than we thought."",
  ""It's usually seasonally slow in Q3, particularly in academia."",
  ""And so, could you describe what drove some of that strength in Benchtop demand in the quarter outside of that channel and if we should expect that strength to persist into Q4?"",
  ""I know you characterized it a little bit earlier, but sort of what does the overall market look like right now for you guys?"",
  ""It looks like you're getting some pricing power on the units."",
  ""Is this more sort of market demand-driven or is it a function of maybe fewer discounts, rebates or inflationary adjustments?"",
  ""If you could just characterize that for me as well?"",
  ""And it feels like you have your arms wrapped nicely around CATSA at this point and margins are heading in the right direction."",
  ""It seems like it still might be a few quarters until you get to your target on that project, but when do you think you'll have the bandwidth to optimize the workforce, sort of utilize those hands outside of the contract towards maybe other opportunities in the security space?"",
  ""And, besides the Benchtop, the medical imaging saw another sale in the quarter."",
  ""Was that fully reflected or should we expect some of that sale to spill over into Q4 as well?"",
  ""And one last question here, so just big picture, any more color on the sort of NMR segment vertical partnerships as the next leg of growth and if you could speak a little bit more to that?"",
  ""We're just seeing steady and consistent growth in demand across the board."",
  ""We've continued to grow our direct sales organization and improve our distributor network via training and sort of readjusting our incentive program with them."",
  ""So I'm not going to say that we were doing jumping jacks about the performance of Benchtop NMR in Q3."",
  ""I would just characterize it as solid."",
  ""And, again a lot of the POs came in right at the end of the quarter and for just basic revenue rec reasons got pushed into Q4, again, approximately CAD 600,000."",
  ""So, that's what made it a solid quarter."",
  ""We feel like we're just scratching the surface here and you're in the first inning of a nine-inning game, and we're going to do tremendously better in Benchtop NMR going forward."",
  ""And, I think, you'll see that in Q4 and then we have some exciting product announcements throughout 2025."",
  ""First one will be in Q1, and that'll just continue to build on top of the strength in that part of our business."",
  ""It's all of the above."",
  ""We continue to evolve our software and the performance of our machines just even within our existing product lines continue to get better."",
  ""And so, that has enabled us to discount less."",
  ""And, as we continue to evangelize with distributors, they become more confident in maintaining the firmness in their pricing."",
  ""As I've mentioned in previous calls, we've turned down business with that workforce in the past just because we were hunkered down and laser-focused in on making our customer happy, but we are at a stage now where we're actively considering and, I guess, maybe getting very close to working on other contracts with the same team or at least largely the same team."",
  ""So don't want to sort of write this in stone per se but I expect that we're going to make some tangible announceable progress on that front in 2025."",
  ""So, really working hard to make that come true."",
  ""The one specific item that Randall referred to was fully reflected, but we continue to – it'll make similar types of sales each quarter."",
  ""So I expect there to be other ones that will be recognized in Q4."",
  ""And we also are just like actively pursuing and in the progress of – in the process of succeeding, not just pursuing, with new partnerships, exciting partnerships that we hope will expand our MRI business going forward."",
  ""Having said that, it is also true that maybe some of our older partnerships might evolve and we might discontinue activity with a certain partner that we've been working with for a couple of years, but replace that with new and more exciting partnerships that are more closely related to our proprietary technology."",
  ""So, again, I think there's a good chance there might be some news about those types of things in 2025."",
  ""I mean, that's a critical part of our growth strategy and we're working exceedingly hard on those strategic partnerships."",
  ""In the last 12 months, we were Our pleasure."",
  "" very much, operator, and  very much to all shareholders and employees that joined us on this call and look forward very much to the next opportunity to speak with you."",
  ""So, have a wonderful afternoon and  very much.""

  "" to our strategic positioning and effective utilization of our extensive network of assets, our handled volumes increased by 5.5% compared to last year."",
  ""Looking at our Grain segment, our joint ventures continue to play a vital role in our asset network by enabling our farmer-direct origination strategy and serving as key bridgeheads for Ceres to reach producers and deliver unique value to customers."",
  ""Volumes handled at Berthold Farmers Elevator rose by 4% this quarter, mainly due to our systematic planning during spring and summer to accommodate higher harvested volumes."",
  ""At Farmers Grain, In our Supply Chain Services segment, we achieved record volumes and new record revenues this quarter compared to the same period last year."",
  ""Timely rail logistics, increased demand for fertilizer products and Northgate team's ability to handle higher customer volumes were the main drivers for this increase."",
  ""The gateway pipeline connection to Northgate continues to perform well, with volumes for the gateway facility rising by 2% this quarter compared to the first quarter of 2024."",
  ""Building on the record-breaking soybean crush volumes from last fiscal year, our Seed Retail and Processing segment has once again achieved record quarterly soybean crush volumes and margins in the first quarter of 2025, reflecting a 4% and 14% increase, respectively, over the same period last year."",
  ""This success is largely attributed to our team's implementation of operational efficiencies at the Jordan crush plant and to our effective trading and strategic positioning."",
  ""I will now turn things over to Blake to review our financial results for the quarter."",
  ""Then, before we open the floor for questions, I will comment on the company's plan for the rest of the fiscal year."",
  ""As we enter the colder months and harvests conclude in the Northern Plains and the Canadian Prairies, our focus will shift to other regions such as South America."",
  ""Our team will closely monitor weather patterns like La Niña and global crop development to strategically position a network of assets and capitalize on market opportunities."",
  ""In the Supply Chain Services segment, we expect higher volumes due to steady industrial product and fertilizer volumes and increased demand for Northgate's transloading products, which should drive solid results next quarter."",
  ""For the Seed Retail and Processing segment, we expect that the higher than average soybean crop production in Manitoba, coupled with our ability to source local beans, will help us maintain high crush capacity utilization and achieve adequate margins next quarter."",

  ""As environmental sustainability becomes increasingly important, we will continue to find opportunities to foster more efficient growing practices among our farmer partners and position Ceres to lead the adoption of regenerative agriculture practices."",
  ""With a solid start to the year, we remain committed to our core strategy of effectively trading and merchandising our core products, optimizing our partner network, using creative partnerships to increase grain origination, and maximizing the value of our assets for our shareholders."",

  ""Net trading margin was $8.4 million, down 46.6% from the prior year due to lower trading margins across our core commodities."",
  ""Supply Chain Service revenue was $1.9 million, up 15.4% from last year, mainly due to higher third-party storage and elevation."",
  ""Our net Seed and Processing margin was $2.4 million in 2024, up 13.6% compared to last year, primarily driven by record crush volumes and margins this quarter."",

  ""The benefit of regenerative ag is because that is very much aligned with our mission that we're enabling our customers achieve great things."",
  ""And most of our end customers value sustainability as a way of supplying their end customers."",
  ""What regenerative ag does for us, it allows us to really increase our origination and been able to increase our trading volumes for our end customers and merchandising volumes as well."",
  ""So, by virtue of having something that our customers value and want to increase and make Ceres the preferred supplier for our key customers."",
  ""Most of the time, yes."",
  ""Well, if you look at our volumes, as an example, they have increased steadily."",
  ""And I would say the incremental volumes that we have in wheat, as an example, which is our biggest product line, I would say today 20% to 25% is attributed to having regenerative ag that allows us to increase the volumes merchandising sold to these customers."",
  ""Without having regenerative ag, they might go to another supplier now."",
  ""There's plenty more to do in outside of Grain."",
  ""If you look at Grain itself, we are – we're running at a pretty high capacity."",
  ""If you look at the businesses, the non-ag businesses that we're running there, we're running at a high capacity utilization."",
  ""However, it's about 1,300 acres and in a strategic location, which we can do a lot more things in Northgate."",
  ""So, the capacity for the land We consider partnering in businesses that we're doing today."",
  ""Today, we don't need it."",
  ""We're doing everything on our own."",

  ""But as far as partnering with somebody else in Grain, no, we're – everything is 100% Ceres."",
  ""We're still looking for partners there if somebody would like to invest in a crush plant."",
  ""Obviously, the prognosis of crush going forward is – perhaps has changed a bit."",
  ""But I think we'll have to see what this new administration does as far as the incentives for – especially around renewable diesel in the US and Canada."",
  ""But we are always looking if somebody would like to partner for a potential crush project in Northgate, we're all ears."",
  ""but I think near term, we haven't really."",
  "", everybody, for your participation in today's call."",
  ""We appreciate your support and look forward to speaking with you again next quarter."",
  ""The interest charges were down this quarter."",
  ""We had lower daily average borrowings on our revolving line of credit, largely due to lower commodity prices year-over-year."",
  ""And additionally, we have used some of the proceeds to pay down – of our sale of Canterra Seeds to pay down our term loan, which also resulted in lower interest expense on the term loan as well."",
  ""Yeah, lower interest rates for Ceres in order to fund our purchases of grain."",
  ""We borrow on our revolving line of credit, and it is factoring the cost to carry grain through the years."",

  ""We want to talk about our performance on Q3 and year-to-date, get into a deeper review of the financial results, and we'll turn it over for a Q&A at the end."",
  ""So, quick progress on priorities first."",
  ""Our priorities for 2024 are very clear, very, very clear."",
  ""And it was all about advancing integration in 2024 so that we have a very clear and clean platform to grow off of in 2025."",
  ""Reminding shareholders that we've done a ton of work, and you'll see a little bit as we get through the deck here on operational consolidation, on organizational consolidation, on commercial leadership, and then, of course, one thing we don't talk about much, but is systems integration, which is kind of a very heavy lift."",
  ""So, lots of work on integration."",
  ""Also to remind shareholders, originally when we were in the pre-merger integration process and then stepping into post-merger integration, originally our plan was to have everything complete by mid and latest third quarter 2025."",
  ""Happy to report that all of our integration work will be complete by the end of 2024, and we'll talk a little bit more detail as we progress through the deck here."",
  ""So, lots of heavy lift, probably the heaviest quarter we've had on the year given the closure of some facilities, but a lot of work on the integration side and advancing the integration."",
  ""Some good work on gross margin improvements to build a better platform and a better base for growth over time."",
  ""Resetting kind of our base to get back to profitable growth."",
  ""We'll talk to that today."",
  ""And then obviously driving higher levels of cash flow."",
  ""So, lots of good work from the team, as you'll see in the few slides here."",
  ""We announced the four plant closures."",
  ""You can see on the left here."",
  ""Our Fergus plant is complete and swept clean and keys are going back to the landlord."",
  ""And then our Trenton facility, which we're shifting into Torbram, we only have one line left on the floor, and that will be complete and closed by the end of November, sweeping the floors in December and handing back the keys to the landlord."",
  ""Our lease expires the 15th of January."",
  ""So, both of those are about six to eight months ahead of what we originally planned in our pre-merger integration process."",
  ""So, very, very good result there."",
  ""Again, the other two factories are already closed."",
  ""So, again, as we exit this year and enter into next year, we've got a nice, clean platform."",
  ""We've also invested in new equipment."",
  ""Up in the far left is the Heidelberg Speedmaster, state-of-the-art Heidelberg press, commercial printing press, runs 18,000 sheets an hour, and we're running that fully utilized right now."",
  ""We actually took three presses into one as a result of this additional -- or this kit."",
  ""In the center of the page, the new Durst, they're large format presses, put one in our Burlington facility and one in Calgary, getting great results on that."",
  ""Bottom left is our saddle stitcher."",
  ""We took three saddle stitchers into one, again, to drive efficiency and productivity."",
  ""And then, bottom right is our new Omet press, that is to run labels."",
  ""We're just in the final stages of commissioning the first press in our Torbram, Brampton facility."",
  ""And two more presses are on the water that will be installed by year-end."",
  ""And that has taken six presses down to three, given the state-of-the-art labelling press that we've acquired here."",
  ""So, great platform as we think about moving into 2025, that will be all installed and incredible efficiency and productivity."",
  ""Our technology migration, we haven't really talked to shareholders too much about this, but I'd say this is probably the heaviest lift in addition to the factory closures, but the heaviest lift we've had, migrating all of our customers on the DCMFlex."",
  ""The MCC legacy clients were using a product called Custom Point."",
  ""So, all those clients are now using DCMFlex."",
  ""So, that's happy -- happy to report that that is complete."",
  ""We've only got a couple left to complete by year-end."",
  ""Our ERP and manufacturing, so ERP and MRP migration from SAP, SAP was MCC legacy, ERP solution into Microsoft D365."",
  ""We've been managing that sequentially so it wouldn't disrupt our business."",
  ""And that will all be complete by year-end."",
  ""It's essentially kind of 90%, 95% complete at this point."",
  ""And then lots of work obviously on technology and security and infrastructure, given the importance of security in our business."",
  ""And I can say that we've successfully done that."",
  ""PCI compliant in a couple of our facilities, and we're fully SOC 2 compliant across our business."",
  ""So, great work from the team, from a security and from an infrastructure standpoint."",
  ""From a new business perspective, these are year-to-date numbers, we continue to win new business, CAD 5.1 million in revenue year-to-date."",
  ""We'll see that increase significantly as we move into 2025 now that our commercial teams can really focus on the market versus focus internally on integration changes."",
  ""And then we've had some good wallet share, about CAD 28 million in annualized growth within existing accounts as well across multiple number of verticals."",
  ""We've also got a very active pace on contract renewals and extensions."",
  ""And I can say that we've got a 100% retention rate on any contracts that have come up for renewal."",
  ""We've had 15 enterprise client renewals that have come up to be renewed anywhere from two years to five years across verticals, representing 20% of our revenue."",
  ""And we've had 100% win rate."",
  ""So, it shows the quality and capability of our team here to be able to secure 100% of that client base moving forward."",
  ""really positive results on our extensions."",
  ""And then we've had some good tech-enabled service wins."",
  ""We obviously can't talk about the clients publicly, but we've had some wins with alternative lender, a couple of financial wins, some good wins on a company that specializes in loyalty, in health care and in airline."",
  ""So, good progress on some of the tech-enabled solutions that we're delivering to clients, continue to drive that client penetration."",
  ""We launched ASMBL in July."",
  ""We really didn't get started until people got back to work in September, right, post holidays."",
  ""So, we really got into the market in September."",
  ""We've got a very active funnel."",
  ""We already have -- again, for competitive reasons, I won't tell you how many are active in top of funnel, but we've got many that are already in bottom funnel in proposal stage."",
  ""To remind shareholders, the average kind of time to revenue is about 180 days in the digital asset management solutioning space."",
  ""And so, we will certainly be announcing some good success as we get -- as we continue to progress and get those proposals into conversion and into clients."",
  ""The platform demos very well, and it's incredible platform that we've built."",
  ""So, we'll see some good success there."",
  ""Also, I'm sure shareholders read the announcement we put out, it was about a week ago James, right, closing the deal of an acquisition we did called Zavy."",
  ""Zavy is a software-as-a-service solution that was founded in New Zealand about five or six years ago."",
  ""It plays in the social media analytics and management space of MarTech."",
  ""That is a very sizable category currently given the amount of investment in social media by large enterprises."",
  ""And that category is growing."",
  ""You can see on the chart here."",
  ""It's currently a $4.8 billion market, just the analytics side of the market and management side of the market, and it's projected to grow to $14.7 billion."",
  ""So, we're really pleased with this acquisition."",
  ""The team that founded it has done a great job in New Zealand, but New Zealand is a relatively small market, of course."",
  ""So, they could only go so far."",
  ""And we have the opportunity to bring it out and put it into our commercial team and really kind of North Americanize the product."",
  ""I'll be clear in terms of what we paid for it."",
  ""We paid CAD 800,000 for this platform and it already has about CAD 600,000 in ARR."",
  ""So, a good opportunity for us to build off of something that's kind of well-established."",
  ""So, we're very pleased with that acquisition, and we'll be able to report progress on that as we move forward."",
  ""We're already accelerating the introduction to our commercial teams."",
  ""Also happy to report that we published our first ESG report."",
  ""And you can see it here, very well received by our client base."",
  ""And we did a good marketing effort around it to let current clients and future clients understand our leadership in ESG."",
  ""So, very good success behind launching that report."",
  ""Now, moving over to our financial results in quarter three and year-to-date."",
  ""On the revenue side, our revenue was certainly lower than we expected, at CAD 108.7 million, we were down 11.4%."",
  ""And the reason we were down in the quarter, few reasons."",
  ""One is obviously we've continued to exit lower margin businesses, and you'll see that when we look at our gross profit line."",
  ""We obviously were pretty internally focused in the quarter."",
  ""It's the heaviest quarter of restructuring that we've had, especially on the factory closures and legacy system migrations."",
  ""And then we had a few, not many, but we had a few large enterprise accounts that had some budget shifts that we'll see reappear as we move into 2025."",
  ""So, again, a little less than what we expected, but you'll see that return as we exit this year and into next year."",
  ""Year-to-date revenue is still positive at 14.5%, just over CAD 360 million in revenue year-to-date."",
  ""Now, the line I want to draw your attention to, of course, is that gross profit line, because we've always said we want to continue to improve gross profit, build a better platform for growth off of."",
  ""And you can see that we're up just over 1% on gross profit and -- or gross margin, rather."",
  ""Gross profit down slightly, and that's really just a function of revenue."",
  ""So, as our revenue grows off of a much stronger client base, a much more profitable client base, a much more profitable mix of business, a far more effective and efficient way of running our business as well, you'll see that gross profit increase as a result of the gross margin increase."",
  ""Gross profit on a year-to-date basis, 27.4%, about CAD 800 million in gross profit, and you can see the increase of about 15.7% over a year ago."",
  ""Welcome to the DATA Communications Management Corp. Third Quarter Fiscal 2024 Financial Results Conference Call."",
  ""My name is James Lorimer, the CFO of DCM, and I'm pleased to be hosting today's call."",
  ""Joining me on the call today is Richard Kellam, our President and Chief Executive Officer."",
  ""Following our prepared remarks, we will be moderating a Q&A session."",
  ""As a reminder, this conference call is being broadcast live and recorded."",
  ""We'd also like to remind everyone that Richard and I can be available after the call for any follow-up questions that you might have."",
  ""Before we begin, I will remind everyone that we'll be referring to forward-looking information on today's call."",
  ""This information is subject to certain risks and uncertainties as outlined in the forward-looking information disclosure in our press release and more fully within our public disclosure filings on SEDAR+."",
  ""We have posted a brief message from Richard along with a summary of our results and our key initiatives for the third quarter on our website in the form of an infographic."",
  ""Our detailed information is also available on our website and SEDAR+."",
  ""Please follow us on LinkedIn to keep up with other business developments."",
  ""I'd now like to turn the call over to Richard."",
  ""SG&A expenses came in nicely, down about CAD 2.7 million compared to last year, which is really kind of the first direct comparable."",
  ""We had started to accelerate a lot of our overheads reductions in the second quarter of last year, but really kind of got at it in the third and fourth quarters of last year."",
  ""And then you would have seen additional plant overheads reducing throughout the first part of this year."",
  ""So, nicely, about 20.6% of revenue, and we expect those kind of levels to maintain through the next few quarters."",
  ""SG&A year-to-date is about CAD 71.7 million, up a little bit, but last year, the comparable period included -- or sorry, this year, included the full kind of first four months of the year, which we didn't have the MCC acquisition last year."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA, despite the lower levels of revenue, the overhead improvements that we've made, contributed to a 6.6% increase in adjusted EBITDA on a year-over-year basis."",
  ""We came in at CAD 12.6 million, up almost CAD 1 million from last year."",
  ""We continue to really strive for that kind of north of 14% adjusted EBITDA margin as a percent of revenues."",
  ""Adjusted EBITDA on a year-to-date basis is up 25.4%."",
  ""Again, we include the full benefit of the MCC acquisition here."",
  ""Synergies, we're pleased to say that we substantially completed our plans to drive our CAD 30 million to CAD 35 million of annualized synergies following the acquisition of Moore Canada."",
  ""The organizational, operational and procurement synergies are well in place, and we've been pushing hard on the revenue and -- revenue synergies."",
  ""We think those will really accelerate next year, particularly through some of our strategic revenue management opportunities."",
  ""You can see the fairly significant declines in head count that we've gone through since the acquisition."",
  ""We're sitting a little bit north of 1,600 active employees today."",
  ""That's helped drive revenue per associate to continued higher levels."",
  ""We're up about 3.7% on a revenue per associate since the closing of the acquisition."",
  ""Net debt has continued to be at very nice levels."",
  ""We're down about CAD 68 million since the acquisition closed, almost 50% reduction."",
  ""That's largely because of the real estate sales that we completed right after the acquisition and last year, as well as equity offering that we did about a year ago, and free cash flow generation."",
  ""So, our revolver is kind of floating in and around the CAD 75 million to CAD 77 million on a kind of a net basis."",
  ""We have brought our cash balance down."",
  ""It's below CAD 10 million now."",
  ""With that, I'd like to turn the call over to the audience for questions.""
]","[
  ""Can you hear me okay?"",
  ""So, my first question is on the revenue line."",
  ""You touched on -- Richard, you touched on budgetary shifts from some large enterprise clients."",
  ""Can you just touch on the visibility you have there?"",
  ""Like, is it -- is this going to be like a Q1 2025 thing, maybe some will hit in Q4?"",
  ""It kind of feels to me like, just based on your commentary, maybe it's a Q1 type of event, but any color you'd have would be helpful?"",
  ""And then my second question is pivoting on the Zavy acquisition."",
  ""It seems like you paid a pretty reasonable multiple."",
  ""Can you just touch on the M&A pipeline, maybe some color on the composition, valuations you're seeing?"",
  "" so much for the color."",
  ""Can you hear me, guys?"",
  ""Just wanted to have a couple of questions on your lease liabilities, seem to increase quite substantially."",
  ""You did make a comment on doing some acquisitions of equipment."",
  ""Can you just give me a little more color on the quarter and how you see that playing out, say, maybe in Q4 and maybe early next year?"",
  ""So, by my calculations looking at your financials, it's about CAD 12 million this quarter in expenses -- additional equipment."",
  ""Is that like a portion -- is that covering off all the equipment, or is there going to be another sort of half that amount in Q4 then as the other stuff comes online?"",
  ""And on the debt side, how much debt did you go down?"",
  ""I have about CAD 5 million this quarter."",
  ""Is that sort of correct, right, and is that sort of what you're going to go forward with moving for Q4 and Q1?"",
  ""Just on your -- the technical sales, I see that, like, when I'm looking at your breakdown, you don't seem to be sort of gaining traction in your tech-enabled subscription service sales on that side of things."",
  ""How are you seeing that going to be changing going into Q4 and into 2025?"",
  ""I'll yield the floor to questions."",
  ""Yeah, we got it now, Max."",
  ""We've got -- , Max."",
  ""I mean, we have very good sight lines on workflow through to our top enterprise clients."",
  ""We're seeing a very healthy kind of pipeline as we move into 2025."",
  ""There will be some work that will flow back in 2024, but majority will shift into the early part of 2025 at this point."",
  ""I want to And listen, it's a heavy lift moving two ERP systems into one."",
  ""For a period of time, all of our CX folks, right, all of our customer service people and all of our salespeople needed to understand how to operate within two systems."",
  ""We've been essentially invoicing MCC legacy clients on an MCC invoice, and invoicing DCM clients on a DCM invoice."",
  ""All that is behind us as we close the year."",
  ""So, it'll be a very different year in 2025."",
  ""I'll handle Zavy, and you can take on Q4."",
  ""So, huge opportunities obviously within our client base."",
  ""Most of our large enterprise B2C clients are doing a fair bit of social media, buying social media communication, and a few have an analytics tool today."",
  ""So, we see a big opportunity."",
  ""We had 53 of our commercial leaders on the line on Monday to introduce Zavy to the teams."",
  ""We were quick to introduce it to the team."",
  ""We already have about four or five demos lined up over the course of the next week, week-and-a-half."",
  ""So, we see a big opportunity."",
  ""The platform is a great platform."",
  ""They've built an incredible piece of software, spent a lot more money building it than we paid for it, by the way."",
  ""So, we get the benefit of that."",
  ""And it's very quick to demo."",
  ""And the time to revenue is shorter than a digital asset management solution because, remember, digital asset management solution, you essentially have to change your workflow and adopt a different process."",
  ""When you're introducing a DAM, you may be moving from a SharePoint or moving from different kind of internal system."",
  ""Whereas, a social media analytics platform, you can switch it on kind of overnight and start understanding how you're performing, how your posts are performing relative to your competition."",
  ""So, it really is a great solution."",
  ""So, we're quite optimistic about how we'll progress from a revenue perspective on that, given it's now in our world."",
  ""You want to talk about quarter four outlook?"",
  ""No, I'd say that, also -- no, I'd say, we're certainly seeing improvements as we move into quarter four."",
  ""Also to remind shareholders, quarter one and quarter two, but especially quarter one is a big, big quarter for us, because that's when we do a lot of what we call our business communication services, a lot of tax stuff, and our factories or our plants run kind of all in high utilization."",
  ""So, you'll see that happen again as we get into quarter one and quarter two and you'll see that margin turn as well because, of course, you've got the high utilization and fixed cost overhead recovery."",
  ""So, that BCS business kind of runs hard in quarter one, quarter two and it drops a little bit obviously in quarter three and quarter four and then peaks again in quarter one, quarter two."",
  ""We're trying to obviously flatten the trough a little bit by putting hyper-personalized direct mail communication through those facilities."",
  ""We'll see that continue to improve as we progress through 2025."",
  ""But, yeah, you know what, we've got a good pipeline, we've got good client renewals, as I said, 100%, 15 clients, who represent 20% of our revenue, fully renewed for future."",
  ""And we're expecting to see good profitable growth."",
  ""So, not growth at any expense, but profitable growth as we step in or move forward into 2025."",
  ""I can talk to that one, Noel."",
  ""So, we said that the CAD 30 million to CAD 35 million, operations, organization and procurement, were hard synergies, not soft synergies."",
  ""So, of course, operations are a hard synergy."",
  ""Those are hard cost savings when you close four facilities."",
  ""Same with organization when you're downsizing, working with fewer people."",
  ""The only one there's a slight variability on obviously is procurement."",
  ""About 50% of what we projected would be somewhat volume variable."",
  ""Obviously, if you're buying less, you're saving less."",
  ""If you're buying more, you're saving more."",
  ""But we're still comfortable in that CAD 30 million to CAD 35 million range given what procurement represented as a total of those synergy savings."",
  ""And we track this stuff every day."",
  ""So, we're comfortable in the CAD 30 million to CAD 35 million range even if volume at the base that it's at right now, given they're hard synergies."",
  ""One thing James pointed to in that slide is the revenue synergy line."",
  ""We haven't forecasted any revenue synergies in that CAD 30 million to CAD 35 million."",
  ""So, as we return to growth and that growth is profitable growth and we see margin improvements, then there's an upside there as well."",
  ""Would you take that one?"",
  ""And just on that, on the postal increase, I think it's important to understand that there is a regulatory requirement that if I'm a client of a financial institution or utility that I get paper, right?"",
  ""So, clients can't just switch off a paper statement because of a postal increase."",
  ""Of course, clients and, of course, the FIs and the utilities of the world and anybody printing paper statements are continually trying to get people to move to digital."",
  ""It's kind of a headwind that we face, we face that forever, right?"",
  ""But there's still a requirement, a regulatory requirement to offer paper."",
  ""So, we've actually looked at and modeled this out when there have been postal increases, what the impact to business is, and it's not that significant, believe it or not."",
  ""So, obviously, it could be a little more significant on the discretionary side."",
  ""So, hyper-personalized direct mail, let's say, you're a not-for-profit and you're mailing personalized communication out, then you may -- that's -- it's not -- that's discretionary, right?"",
  ""You may decide to mail fewer of them, but more targeted."",
  ""And of course, you get a better return if they're more targeted."",
  ""So, that may move around a little bit."",
  ""And then, on the strike, hard to predict what the impact of that could be, how long it will -- if there is a strike, how long it will last, what will happen with mail during that time, what will happen with -- certainly, there will be an impact, but it's very hard to predict exactly what that impact could be on any of -- anybody in the industry's business."",
  ""It's a great question, though."",
  ""I'd just say  to all of our associates, our 1,600-plus associates, doing a fantastic job at bringing these two companies together and building a good, solid platform for profitable growth as we move into 2025."",
  ""Again, it's been a heavy lift, and I appreciate the efforts of the entire team."",
  ""And  to all of our clients for standing by us."",
  ""And we appreciate doing fantastic work for you as well."",
  ""So, we'll report back to shareholders as we close out the year and step into 2025."",
  ""I guess our next contact will be sometime...?"",
  ""So, we'll have lots to report at that time."",
  ""And if you have a question and are accessing the call through Teams, you can use the Raise Your Hand feature in Teams, and we'll queue up questions."",
  ""Alternatively, you can also use the Chat feature in Teams, and we will respond to Chat questions as well."",
  ""If you have dialed in, you may use Star 5 to raise or lower your hand and pressing Star 6 will mute or unmute your microphone."",
  ""Please introduce yourself once you are introduced to the session."",
  ""I see a call from Max Ingram."",
  ""Max, would you like to go ahead, please?"",
  ""We've got a very healthy M&A pipeline."",
  ""There's kind of three different markets that we've talked about as opportunities where we're targeting."",
  ""One would be conventional print companies, and we have a nice pipeline in that market."",
  ""The other would be marketing services businesses, and think about companies that provide strategy or advice to clients, but don't own any print, but there might be some downstream print opportunities that could fall out of that if we were to own those."",
  ""So, we've got a few companies that we're looking at in that space."",
  ""The other area that we looked at was marketing technology applications and opportunities."",
  ""Zavy was certainly in that bucket, and we're pleased to get that deal."",
  ""We're really excited about it."",
  ""We continue to look at some other opportunities out there."",
  ""In the conventional print market, we are looking a little bit at some kind of adjacencies with some of the new equipment that we have."",
  ""We're seeing some market opportunities to go after in areas that are a little bit different from what we've historically done, but leveraging the same kind of print and kind of project management and complex projects, expertise that we have."",
  ""So, that kind of first market that I talked about, we see that probably expanding a little bit."",
  ""And I have a caller here."",
  ""I think this is Noel Atkinson."",
  ""Noel, I think you should be good now."",
  ""Apologies, Noel, maybe we'll come back to you in a minute here."",
  ""Chris, we had a number of the pieces of equipment that Richard highlighted earlier in the presentation, came on or are kind of in flight right now."",
  ""The Heidelberg press in Bond, Thistle, that commenced, I guess it was really kind of operational in June."",
  ""So, we started to see the full impact of that lease expense and liability in the third quarter."",
  ""The saddle stitcher as well came on in the third quarter in Bond."",
  ""The three Omet presses; the first one's just getting set up right now."",
  ""So, we'll see that come on this quarter and the remaining two, which are literally on the water on a boat from Italy right now, are expected to be delivered in late November or probably early December."",
  ""So, we'll start to see those leases come on probably more in the first quarter."",
  ""We also had the two Durst presses; one in Burlington and one in Calgary, those were installed in July."",
  ""So, those would be kind of the primary pieces of equipment that we installed in the quarter."",
  ""We've got one or two other small things coming on."",
  ""We will see kind of our overall lease liabilities come down a little bit next year with the exit of the Trenton and Fergus facilities."",
  ""Our Trenton lease expires January 15 and the Fergus lease is December 31."",
  ""So, starting in the in the first quarter, we'll see a little bit of an offset from those reductions."",
  ""Some of the equipment that's coming in or to be installed in the balance of the year has been -- prepayments have been advanced for those."",
  ""So, you'll see a little bit of -- we had some interim funding agreements for those with the leasing companies that are financing those."",
  ""So, once those are fully installed, they'll flip to a kind of a complete lease."",
  ""I think net debt was flat -- up a little bit compared to last year -- or sorry, last quarter."",
  ""We'll see it likely come down a little bit with some working capital improvements in the fourth quarter."",
  ""The fourth quarter is typically a stronger quarter as we kind of gear up for the first quarter, which is typically strongest with the transactional print business, in particular, that does personalized communications, tax forms, et cetera, in the first quarter."",
  ""So, yeah, we will see -- certainly, we expect free cash flow to improve as some of the heavier kind of capital expenditures are behind us this year."",
  ""And so, I think our capital expenditures year-to-date are a little over CAD 9 million, CAD 9.5 million."",
  ""We expect CapEx will come down by probably 30% next year."",
  ""We had a couple of smaller clients that we ceased work with."",
  ""They were doing kind of lower margin scanning and archiving work that was not very profitable for us."",
  ""So, you'll see a little bit of a revenue decline there, about CAD 0.5 million, not material at all from a margin perspective."",
  ""So, we are kind of focusing on kind of high-grading some of the tech services that we're offering."",
  ""And tech services will definitely kind of bump up in the fourth quarter and then the first quarter because those are kind of heavier quarters for some of the programming work that we do for transactional print."",
  ""Noel, do you want to try and...?"",
  ""We have a Q&A here."",
  ""I'm just teeing up a question."",
  "", Noel, for the question in the chat."",
  ""What are you seeing for business activity so far in Q4?"",
  ""And also, what do you see as annual market opportunity for Zavy revenue within our enterprise client base?"",
  ""Do you want to handle...?"",
  ""So, the second question -- or maybe the first question, I guess, from Noel was, what are you seeing for business activity so far in Q4?"",
  ""We are seeing improved strength certainly compared to Q3."",
  ""A couple of our larger facilities, we're seeing healthy backlog, which is a good sign."",
  ""We have some programs that are coming on in the fourth quarter."",
  ""So, we think we'll end the fourth quarter certainly better than we performed in the third quarter."",
  ""Do you want to add anything, Richard?"",
  ""And then, Noel has a follow-on question."",
  ""Do all CAD 30 million to CAD 35 million per year of expected merger synergies still get recognized in -- or realized in 2025 results with our revenue baseline exiting... ...Q3 2024?"",
  ""We have a question from Nick Corcoran at Acumen."",
  ""Nick's asking, recent news with the rotating strike at Canada Post and postage rate increase in 2025, how may this impact your business?"",
  ""I guess, we're certainly kind of keeping a close eye for both those events or possibilities."",
  ""The potential for rotating strike is certainly kind of near term here."",
  ""We're actively engaged in discussions with our clients for kind of alternative distributions and other things that we can do to serve them better in this period."",
  ""We're also working actively with our clients on their direct mail programs and other kind of personalized communications, transactional mail work."",
  ""The postage rate increase is scheduled to go into effect in kind of mid-January."",
  ""So, we're certainly working with customers to see how best to communicate with their clients, are there opportunities to maybe bring some of that work forward and get some mailing done before those rate increases kick in."",
  ""Looks like we have no further questions."",
  ""Richard, did you want to provide some closing remarks?"",
  ""Sometime in middle of March.""

97,3110424,0N5T2T-E,2024-11-28,"[
  ""I'm Bernard Fairman, Co-Founder and Executive Chairman of Foresight Group."",
  ""I'm delighted to welcome you to Foresight's half-year results for the period ended 30th September 2024."",
  ""I'm presenting today alongside Gary Fraser, our CFO."",
  ""Before addressing the group's performance over the last six months, I would like to provide you with a reminder of who we are."",
  ""We're an alternative asset manager that invests in UK and Ireland through private equity and globally in real assets and listed equities."",
  ""We have strong distribution capabilities, reaching over 40,000 retail clients and 200 institutional investors."",
  ""Our range of strategies combine to provide investors with attractive investment opportunities across two key markets."",
  ""Firstly, our long-duration real asset strategies, both private and listed, focus on investment opportunities created by the global energy transition and wider decarbonization agendas which reach beyond power into natural capital as well as broader social, transport and digital infrastructure."",
  ""Secondly, our regional strategy is focused on generating excellent returns by providing capital for growth to small- and medium-sized enterprises throughout the British Isles where the SMEs funding market is structurally underserved."",
  ""On the next slide, I'll show you how we've been able to capitalize on the opportunities presented by these markets to deliver growth in the first half of our financial year."",
  ""Our regional private equity business continued to add and realize value against the backdrop of challenging macroeconomic conditions for both SMEs and private equity firms."",
  ""During the period, successful exits delivered £2.9 million of performance fees with an additional £1.4 million from our VCTs."",
  ""Within our tax efficiency products, our established sales team has made a strong start to the year, raising £241 million into higher margin retail vehicles."",
  ""Our most scalable strategies have also shown positive momentum."",
  ""Within energy transition, we secured commitments of £300 million for the first close of Foresight Energy Infrastructure Partners II, FEIP II as we call it, from two new cornerstone investors."",
  ""The FEIP's first close less than six months after the end of the investment period for FEIP I marks a significant milestone for the group, as we aim to raise multiple vintages of institutional infrastructure funds across a range of low-carbon strategies."",
  ""During the period, FEIP I also made its final investment, a 267-megawatt solar portfolio in Greece through a joint venture with Mirova, a global infrastructure asset manager."",
  ""The solar plant, due for commissioning in 2026, will be the largest in Greece and is expected to power over 100,000 homes with clean energy."",
  ""We've also been contracted to provide asset management services for this project, leveraging the substantial in-house expertise we've built in this field, which helps to maximize investment returns and enhance our competitive position."",
  ""Within decarbonization beyond power, we've built on experience gained from our first forestry fund to develop a second dedicated natural capital strategy, which entered its premarketing phase in the period, as we look to leverage the group's investment capabilities in this area."",
  ""And finally, our listed equity products capitalized on a slightly improved macro environment, achieving positive investment performance of £56 million in the period, coupled with decelerating net outflows."",
  ""I'll now move on to talk about how these strategies combine to deliver a strong track record of growth."",
  ""Our diversified business model, built on the breadth of our investment strategy as I just outlined, has provided another data point in our historic growth profile."",
  ""Our AUM, with a compound annual growth rate of 27% since 2018, has increased from £2.6 billion to £12.4 billion today."",
  ""Core profitability mirrors this trajectory with a CAGR of 29%, increasing from £10.6 million in our first six months post-IPO to £29 million in the last six months."",
  ""We're pleased with our track record of growth and are as excited as ever about the opportunities we see to create further shareholder value by investing in technologies, leading the global energy transition, decarbonizing economies, delivering nature recovery, and unlocking the potential of ambitious companies, all fueled by our ongoing institutional and retail fundraising efforts."",
  ""After Gary has taken you through the financials, I'll share some more color on our fundraising outlook and the key drivers of our future growth."",
  ""So, turning to key financial metrics."",
  ""As Bernard mentioned earlier, our AUM growth in the period was delivered through a successful combination of both institutional and retail fundraising."",
  ""Organic growth drove our revenue increase of £5.4 million to £73.2 million, which in turn led to a 5% increase in core EBITDA pre-SBP."",
  ""This financial performance is in line with our expectations and puts us on track to achieve our growth guidance of doubling core EBITDA pre-SBP in five years, with the benefit of recent institutional fundraising expected to filter through to the financials in the second half of the period and beyond."",
  ""The performance in the half translates into the delivery of further shareholder value with our interim dividend of £0.074 per share, representing a 10% increase on the prior year."",
  ""Now, I'll provide a bit more color on the movement of these key financial metrics."",
  ""Turning first to AUM, which increased from £12.1 billion to £12.4 billion during the six-month period to 30th September 2024, a key driver of this growth was the €300 million accelerated first close of the second vintage of our European-focused FEIP strategy."",
  ""Higher margin retail products distributed by our in-house sales team also delivered a strong half of £241 million in gross inflows."",
  ""Against the backdrop of recent UK regulatory tailwinds, we remain on course for a record year of fundraising into these products with H2 historically higher than H1 due to the timing of retail tax allocations and the opening of our current year VCT strategies."",
  ""In combination, these inflows more than offset negative valuation and FX movements, as well as £111 million of net outflows and our lower-margin OEIC products."",
  ""Despite remaining in net outflows, these did notably decelerate in the half."",
  ""We would hope to see this deceleration continue following recent interest rate reductions and positive investment performance in the period, providing an improved outlook for this division."",
  ""The year-on-year increase of 8% was predominantly organic growth and was driven by fundraising into a higher margin and longer tenure vehicles with strong performance in H2 FY 2024 continuing into H1 FY 2025."",
  ""Our revenues remained of a high quality, with 87% of total revenues recurring annually, which is right in the middle of our guided range."",
  ""We also continue to steadily diversify our revenues geographically."",
  ""21% was non-GBP denominated in the period, an increase in the prior year, and a trend that we expect to continue as we expand our international reach."",
  ""We recorded a £4 million year-on-year increase in underlying administrative expenses."",
  ""The main drivers for this increase were the incorporation of a full six months of prior-year wage inflation, as well as head count growth to support the delivery of the group's fundraising ambitions."",
  ""Current year wage increases returned to historical averages following the above average increases in FY 2024 in what was a high-inflationary environment."",
  ""During the period, we have also made an acquisition-related net accounting adjustment of £2.9 million."",
  ""This incorporates impairment, earnout, and deferred tax adjustments in relation to our 2022 acquisition of Infrastructure Capital Group in Australia."",
  ""Looking ahead, however, we expect cost growth to moderate."",
  ""5% year-on-year core EBITDA pre-SBP growth was driven by successful prior-year and year-to-date fundraising into higher margin and longer tenure vehicles."",
  ""The slight decrease in year-on-year margin was as a result of a higher cost environment, as well as investment in fundraising capabilities."",
  ""We expect operating margin to expand as we convert a strong fundraising pipeline across our highly profitable and highly scalable strategies."",
  ""I'll now pass you back to Bernard."",
  ""Looking ahead, we are confident that the fundraising pipeline remains strong and that this will fuel our ability to deliver on our guidance of doubling core EBITDA in five years to the end of FY 2029."",
  ""In regional private equity post-period end, we completed a £50 million first close of our 14th active regional fund, Foresight South West Fund."",
  ""Our tax efficiency products remain on track for a record year, with strong inflows following clarity provided at the UK's Autumn Budget."",
  ""And we're already seeing evidence of a move from – aim to unlisted investments among leading independent financial advisers."",
  ""In energy transition, FEIP II continues to have strong investor engagement, as the fund works towards a second close."",
  ""In decarbonization beyond power, our first natural capital strategy has had a number of encouraging discussions with existing institutional investors to increase the fund size, and we're progressing well on our second fund in this sector."",
  ""And finally, we anticipate that recent interest rate reductions will drive further performance across our listed equity products and lead to a subsequent return to net inflows over time."",
  ""Separately, accretive M&A will remain a key strategic lever that we explore to accelerate profitable growth alongside our existing retail and institutional fundraising pipeline."",
  ""Now, providing a bit more detail on a few of these fundraising channels."",
  ""Our retail tax efficiency products provide consistent and near-daily inflows with total fundraising across these products over the last three years, equating to a 42% compound annual growth rate."",
  ""Looking ahead, the strength of our investment performance and the depth of our distribution team with 50 in-house personnel gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver meaningful fundraising for these products."",
  ""Additionally, the UK's Autumn Budget help to provide clarity to investors in Foresight's tax efficiency products."",
  ""As a result, we expect demand for these products to remain strong."",
  ""We're on track to deliver another record year for retail fundraising."",
  ""Post-period end, we successfully completed a £50 million first close of our 14th active regional private equity fund, Foresight South West Fund, with a second close expected in the current financial year."",
  ""This marks the fourth new regional fund we've launched in the past two years with over £250 million raised across our regional funds during this period."",
  ""The fund is structured as an evergreen fund, providing a permanent pool of capital to support long-term regional investment opportunities."",
  ""To further strengthen our presence and engagement in the South West, we'll be opening new offices in Bristol and Exeter in the coming months to help connect with SMEs on a local level."",
  ""With a strong track record, deep regional relationships and governments desire to encourage investment in the regions, we're confident in being able to raise additional new funds, as well as follow-on vintages in this strategy."",
  ""This includes an expected third vintage of our Foresight Regional Investment Fund that invests in growth companies across the North West, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and North Wales in 2025."",
  ""With this area of our business firing on all cylinders, we believe that we can deliver further near-term growth in what we believe is a structurally underserved market."",
  ""As I've said before, we see the global energy transition as the greatest investment opportunity of a generation."",
  ""To address it, we have created a diversified and differentiated strategy focused on portfolio construction, value generation, and sustainability impact to deliver long-term returns for its investors, namely our flagship energy transition strategy, Foresight Energy Infrastructure Partners Funds I and II."",
  ""FEIP I, the first vintage, secured €1 billion in total commitments from 29 investors, with 97% of the fund now allocated to 14 different investments across the UK and Europe just three years after final close."",
  ""FEIP II, the second vintage, has already raised a £300 million first close in June, and the fund is progressing well towards a further close in the spring of 2025, targeting a total fund size of £1.25 billion, and 12% to 15% gross IRR."",
  ""In conclusion, this period has seen us extend our track record of profitable growth since IPO."",
  ""Long-term structural growth in our key markets of the UK, Australia and mainland Europe is complemented by our highly scalable platform that's able to capitalize effectively on these trends."",
  ""Our revenues remain predictable, providing us with good visibility on a very high percentage of our future earnings."",
  ""This is supplemented by a valuable contribution from performance fees generated from successfully investing in unlisted growth companies, leveraging over 40 years of experience in this area to create value and deliver strong exit."",
  ""Our company is built on robust foundations."",
  ""We've created a diversified and resilient business model that can deliver growth through the economic cycle, by investing in the energy transition, building scalable infrastructure, and backing growth companies."",
  "", and we'll now take your questions.""

  "" very much for the presentation."",
  ""And so, I've got , guys."",
  ""Hopefully, you can hear me."",
  ""Just one quick follow-up on the hydrogen thing."",
  ""There's a question that's come in, I just couldn't hear your thoughts on – from your side."",
  ""Obviously, no longer going ahead with the funds."",
  ""Obviously, you did see the write-down in the So, just to follow up, what is it that is causing these issues in the market that's leading to the pullback of products elsewhere as you mentioned?"",
  ""And I'd ask one broader, but related question to that."",
  ""With the Trump government we have in the US and what feels like possibly some running back on some of the moves towards renewable and sustainable energy."",
  ""Who knows exactly what will happen, but that seems to be the early rhetoric."",
  ""Appreciate you don't have that much, if anything, in the US."",
  ""But how do you see that potentially changing the demand and landscape for renewables and the energy transition that you've talked about more broadly?"",
  ""Tom,  for the question."",
  ""I think the But we've seen, under George Osborne Just taking the second point."",
  ""In terms of the Foresight Natural Capital Fund, I think our target fundraise there up to final close would be between £300 million and £500 million."",
  ""So, it's going to be a material strategy going forward."",
  ""We're receiving a lot of inbound interest into that strategy."",
  ""And as you know, we've been involved in the forestry area in the UK principally for over five years now."",
  ""So, there's an area we've got a lot of experience that we're looking to develop that further and more so on the institutional side."",
  ""And we see that as being a key strategy on the infrastructure piece, the wider infrastructure piece going forward."",
  ""I think the final question was on... Performance fees."",
  ""So, I mean, performance fees have been strong, as you say, principally from the private equity part of the business."",
  ""I think sometimes – these things don't come in in linear fashion."",
  ""I'd expect to see more performance fees, again, principally from the private equity part of the business in the second half year."",
  ""I also think we had a slight, say, asymmetric deployment first half, second half."",
  ""So, I think we'll see a higher degree of arrangement fees from deployment in the second half as well."",
  ""So, you might see more of a balance of deployment of performance fees in the second half."",
  ""But overall, I think we're making progress on both fronts."",
  ""And so, looking ahead just to reiterate the point I made previously, I see us falling within consensus for the year."",
  ""So, just in conclusion, as you know, we've got three parts of our business."",
  ""It's rather all firing on all cylinders at the same time."",
  ""And indeed, we know Foresight Capital Management, like everybody else in the OEIC market is – has had outflows in recent years."",
  ""We know that the infrastructure business is starting to raise cash again, but it's had a year or two where it hasn't."",
  ""But on the other hand, the private equity business and the tax efficient business is putting lots of finer points and it's booming in terms of inflows and returns."",
  ""And you should expect to see more performance fees between now and the end of our financial year."",
  ""And underlines the point that we're David, I think the answer to that is it was all to do with the latter."",
  ""I think we will launch the hydrogen fund, which is not yet."",
  ""I mean, as everybody knows, timing is the most important thing in life, and the time is not yet right, as it turns out."",
  ""So, I would expect to see that relaunch in a year or so, because if anybody can tell me what the – how you power, how to decarbonize forms of energy use other than through hydrogen, I've yet to learn it."",
  ""So, I'm sure hydrogen will be a really important part of the energy transition."",
  ""But you've got to get the timing right."",
  ""And the center point in pushing into a market isn't quite ready yet, and it wasn't, which is why we took the decision."",
  ""But on the other hand, we do – this was in kind of premarketing, we do premarketing for a reason."",
  ""And I think you made the point yourself, David."",
  ""So, by implication, BP, Shell, Repsol, Fortescue in Australia, and yesterday Norsk Hydro, they all pulled back from immediately pushing ahead with green hydrogen project."",
  ""So, I think it is a wider market point as demonstrated by some of those big names as well."",
  ""I think it's probably that there are huge opportunities in decarbonization and bigger than the amount of money available to finance them."",
  ""Hydrogen products typically pretty expensive."",
  ""In the government incentive, in most parts of the world for them to work, if you recall, back in the early days of solar, we needed feed-in tariffs which were enormously attractive."",
  ""And indeed, right at the beginning, we're 90% of the return, 90% from feed-in tariffs and they gradually went down as governments around the world achieved what they were planning to."",
  ""And by the way, I think that was the most successful effort I've ever seen of government's pump priming."",
  ""I mean, normally it's disastrous."",
  ""But in this case, it was a great success and certainly brought solar on much faster than they otherwise would have done."",
  ""Well, the same is required here."",
  ""I think governments recognized that."",
  ""But governments, generally speaking, are pretty strapped for cash."",
  ""And there are other reasons as well like, for example, in Germany, the government subsidies were expected."",
  ""It hasn't happened because a number of reasons, not least of which there is effectively no government in Germany."",
  ""So, until they have their election and they established for their policies, that's kind of on hold."",
  ""So, that's probably the principal reason."",
  ""Slowness of subsidies going forward, without which you'll take much longer."",
  ""Firstly, I think it will make – certainly for us, it will make the slightest difference because we've never invested in things that weren't profitable."",
  ""I mean, hydrogen's an outlier because it's an early technology, but there is no subsidy across a whole range of renewables that we invested."",
  ""Solar, it is profitable in most parts of the world."",
  ""Certainly, it has been a subsidy in the UK in solar for a long time."",
  ""So, I think you're not going to burn coal if it costs three times as much to produce energy as solar does it."",
  ""Texas is full of wind."",
  ""California is full of solar."",
  ""But the more kind of egregious handouts that we've seen over the last year or so under the terms of the IRA, that rather recently named Inflation Reduction Act, will go away and it'll be highly economics that that will drive investment, and I think that's a good thing."",
  ""So, the first question we have on line is from James Allen at Panmure Liberum."",
  ""He has a number of questions, the first being around the level of indicative redemptions on the Australian funds."",
  ""Can you give any more color on the background as to what the situation is there?"",
  ""With a follow-up question around, if there's any further indications on redemptions for EIT and ARIF, and what the implications of that may be."",
  ""Yeah, I mean, in terms of the redemptions, clearly when we made these acquisitions, we just assumed a level of redemptions."",
  ""So, the level we've actually seen on EIT is higher than we'd anticipated."",
  ""These are private funds, so we don't disclose the exact amount."",
  ""I mean, it's disappointing that the amount of redemptions is higher than we thought."",
  ""But I think, generally speaking, the strength within Foresight is the diversity, diversification of the business, the resilience of the business model."",
  ""And so, the question we're still a – on an upward trajectory in terms of the momentum behind the businesses."",
  ""Bernard alluded to earlier, we're driving forward in private equity and retail sales, as well as institutional fundraising in other areas."",
  ""So, I think, overall, we're still on a really positive upward trend."",
  ""In terms of EIT, the redemption window is next year, and ARIF there's no indication of redemptions whatsoever."",
  ""So, I think, overall we've got plenty of time."",
  ""The redemption window is three-plus years."",
  ""So, we've got plenty of time to, A, look at replacing those redemptions with new investment."",
  ""But also we've now – we acquired that business two years ago."",
  ""We're facilitating additional sales resources in that part of the world."",
  ""And so, we'd expect to start raising primary capital over there over the next couple of years, that will hopefully supply any of the redemptions that we see going out the door."",
  ""Also, the redemptions are not new in these funds."",
  ""Long before we came along, they were redemptions, and they simply get close in the market."",
  ""That's all – in the secondary market, that's what we expect will happen here."",
  ""And clearly, it will take away from primary capital while you'll kind of through and through the secondary sales."",
  ""But that, I think is normal in all our business."",
  ""And then, a final question from James on the hydrogen funds."",
  ""So, we've already touched on this in some of your previous answers, but is there any more color you can give in terms of with hydrogen having moved right, in terms of being delayed, is the natural capital fund that's being launched, is that expected to offset that as well as Australia, or how do we think about fundraising and Yes."",
  ""I mean, I think we've covered some of it."",
  ""But just to be clear, I think the natural capital fund will be €300 million to €500 million at final close."",
  ""We'd originally anticipated the hydrogen fund being as much as €750 million at final close."",
  ""I think – so natural capital will cover some of it."",
  ""It's likely to be at a higher fee rate than the hydrogen fund."",
  ""So, we'll cover some of it."",
  ""Where else do I see the – I see additional money coming from the FEIP II subsequent closes, but we're also raising both retail and private equity money more quickly than we'd anticipate."",
  ""So, I think, overall, as I mentioned just previously, the resilience of the business model means that we're still confident in terms of achieving our targets, which just to reemphasize the point is to double core EBITDA pre-SBP over the next five years."",
  ""That's not going to be linear by any means."",
  ""But once we raise those funds and we see the deployment taking shape that will really increase the amount of money that's been driven through to the bottom line."",
  ""So, I'm very confident indeed in our cards."",
  ""I mean, it's worth saying, for example, that we're raising money in the VCT market faster than anybody else."",
  ""The first of a – also enterprise is likely to close in the next week – within the next week, I mean,  both."",
  ""We have one final question over the webcast, which is from Joshua McCarthy I mean, the reality is I think it's too early to say on that specific question."",
  ""I think the update on our FCM was during the six months with an outlook for reduced interest rates."",
  ""We started to see both performance improved and the rates of redemptions reduced."",
  ""I think now that people see interest rates being higher for longer potentially, then that does have the potential to impact the level of redemptions."",
  ""And so, I think I wouldn't forecast the level of redemptions a continuing to decelerate in the second half as I might have done two or three months ago."",
  ""We might see those level of redemptions maintained at the current rate on average for the next six months, which would be disappointing given where we were a few months back."",
  ""But that said, it's factored into our thinking, but we're not sitting on our hands here."",
  ""We've beefed up that retail sales team with specifically focused on the FCM part of the business."",
  ""And we're also looking at other inorganic opportunities as well in that space."",
  ""So, I think there's a lot to go out, and we're really trying to push ahead with that part of the business."",
  ""Bernard, do you have any closing remarks?"",
  ""And then we'll close this."",
  ""Well,  very much, everybody, for attending."",
  ""I hope you've seen evidence in our numbers and our likely performance going forward with the breadth of the business and the strength of the model."",
  ""We  for your support and look forward to speaking to you again next time.""

  "" for joining us this morning."",
  ""We're here to talk about our 3Q results for 2024."",
  ""I'm joined today by a number of colleagues who will assist me in answering any questions."",
  ""As a reminder, today's conference call contains certain statements that are or may be deemed to be forward-looking statements which include all statements other than statements of historical fact."",
  ""Forward-looking statements involve making certain assumptions based on the company's experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, expected future developments, and other factors that we believe are appropriate under the circumstances."",
  ""Although we believe the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual events or results may differ materially from those projected or implied in such forward-looking statements due to known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors."",
  ""And for your reference, our results was also announced this morning."",
  ""Materials are available on our website."",
  ""As a reminder, we're using the same technology that we normally do."",
  ""There'll be a time for Q&A at the end."",
  ""You can either type your question in or you can raise your hand if you want to be unmuted."",
  ""We will endeavor to answer all the questions that we get."",
  ""If some are duplicated or if some are perhaps not for the individual questions we can better answer on an email, please reach out to us also directly through our investor email address."",
  ""So this is our slide where we show the three months of the Q3."",
  ""We also show in the orange the year-to-date financials."",
  ""Third quarter We also today have announced another shareholder distribution in the form of return of paid in capital of NOK 50 million, which has been very, very steady."",
  ""We have also made good headway on our share buyback program."",
  ""We've still some room left to go on that one."",
  ""We're very, very happy to continue to follow our shareholder distribution framework that we announced about a year ago."",
  ""Oil prices So our production target of 13,000 barrels a day has been achieved."",
  ""It's been at times a bumpy road."",
  ""But we've gotten there, very, very happy about it."",
  ""It was achieved recently as wells are starting to come online in Gabon, which we'll touch on a little bit more."",
  ""And also importantly in Equatorial Guinea."",
  ""So our liftings were more or less as guided."",
  ""We had one small lifting in Tunisia, which kind of just slipped into October."",
  ""So it kind of missed the Q3 revenue recognition and slipped into Q4 where we anticipate lifting or we have lifted, I think, a long way through this already 1.4 million barrels."",
  ""Something like 40% of our 2024 liftings are occurring in the fourth quarter."",
  ""Our average price realization year-to-date has been around $80, which is pretty good."",
  ""Obviously, oil prices have subsequently dropped."",
  ""So we're keeping a close eye on that one."",
  ""But nonetheless, it's a very busy quarter for us So our debt profile, RBL facility, it's $70 million."",
  ""Post-period, we took advantage of little headroom in there just to manage some working capital through this heavy CapEx period that we're in."",
  ""But the real story, I guess, is around the CapEx this year, which we've guided back in August that was going to be higher than $75 million."",
  ""And we've recently announced it's close to $95 million now."",
  ""And that's largely as a result of the two things."",
  ""One is the expanded program in Gabon."",
  ""We drilled a couple of extra wells, which obviously is very good for the company."",
  ""It's given us more production, more reserves."",
  ""But equally, the amended work program, the change-out of the rig in Equatorial Guinea has unfortunately given us additional capital expenditure that was not forecast at the time."",
  ""The good news from our perspective certainly is that indicatively CapEx next year should be around $40 million."",
  ""We will – once the rig leaves Gabon after drilling the Bourdon well in February, we will not have a rig on any of our assets during 2025 based on what we see at the moment."",
  ""And so we're kind of at that cash flow inflection point, hopefully, where the increased revenue starts coming through against lower CapEx."",
  ""I'm not going to go through this in great detail."",
  ""It's there for the workings for people that like to look through these."",
  ""But we always produce a reconciliation of cash flow and how we got from the cash position at the beginning of the year to where we currently are."",
  ""So Gabon has obviously been a source of great attention for the company."",
  ""It's been a tricky year with our ESP issues."",
  ""I'm happy to say now and touching wood that the current ESP we do not have any of the old retrievable ESPs in the field anymore."",
  ""We are now either putting in pumps on wells that don't have an ESP on them yet, so for instance, Ruche and one of the Hibiscus wells, or we're producing under the new ESP."",
  ""So it's been a bit of a journey, but things are working extremely well."",
  ""We and BW announced last week that we had achieved greater than 40,000 barrels a day of production, which is a key thing for the company."",
  ""The Adolo has the capacity to go above its nameplate."",
  ""So we do get a lot of questions around how high could production be and all that."",
  ""I would say it's still early days."",
  ""But obviously, with the additional two wells that we've brought online, so that being Hibiscus Northern Flank and Hibiscus South, those two discoveries we made earlier that had been brought online, we've now gone from a position of having originally planned for six wells in the initial phase of this development to eight wells."",
  ""So we still have four slots left on the platform for a future phase of development."",
  ""But we really put ourselves in a position where we have a great inventory of wells that should allow us to produce oil, extend the plateau out here for longer than originally planned."",
  ""So this has really recently been a great success in here."",
  ""We do have the Bourdon all the way through February, at which point it leaves Gabon."",
  ""And the last thing it will do after just finishing up a couple of workovers and the final pump installations is to drill the Bourdon prospect, which we'll touch a little bit more on about."",
  ""But that is a well that we will drill in January, February."",
  ""That said, in Okume, it's been also very active."",
  ""We've had a tricky year with the swap-out of the drilling rig, but I'm happy to now report that we have now completed both wells, the Ceiba infill wells, so the red dots on the screen, and the Okume infill well."",
  ""Those are both completed and hooked up."",
  ""And we're starting now to see the benefit of the additional production coming from there."",
  ""The drill ship, the Noble Venturer, has actually left the production blocks in Okume and moved over to Block S, which is a Kosmos-operated exploration well called Akeng Deep, which we have another slide on."",
  ""And that well is currently drilling."",
  ""We expect results in December from that well."",
  ""Touch a little bit more on that one."",
  ""And in Tunisia, we continue to work."",
  ""Production has been soft this year."",
  ""The country has been going through some political change."",
  ""It has resulted in delays in various regulatory approvals which impact not just Panoro but the industry more widely, and that has simply resulted in less activity."",
  ""So you'll see actually our CapEx or the CapEx – group CapEx has gone up."",
  ""Tunisia actually has been lighter than originally budgeted for that reason."",
  ""And then So one of the things we are starting to talk about a little bit more is where does the company go."",
  ""We've achieved 40,000 barrels at Dussafu."",
  ""We've kind of reached our group target 13,000 barrels."",
  ""What does the And so we're looking at reserves in the high-30s at the moment, which is a very good, strong position to be at."",
  ""We have 29 million barrels net of 2C resources, and that would continue to – not every one of those will migrate itself necessarily to 2P, but certainly a large portion of them should."",
  ""We've recently announced and we'll talk a little bit more about it, the Block-G – EG-23 license award that we have."",
  ""So we think on a portfolio basis, zooming out of the business for a second now put the company in excellent position organically, leaving any M&A to the side to continue to grow the business over the coming years."",
  ""And that's just been very much part of the strategy to put ourselves in a position where organically we can continue to grow this business."",
  ""So just a couple of thoughts around the current exploration program we're drilling as we speak in Block S, the Akeng Deep Well."",
  ""This is operated by Kosmos Energy."",
  ""It is a something like 25% chance of success."",
  ""So it is properly exploration."",
  ""And its aim is to test the deeper Albian."",
  ""So this is a kind of unproven play, quite compelling, because if we do find oil, it is a very short tie-back distance to the FPSO."",
  ""So this what we mean by infrastructure-led exploration and it would – in a success case would have a very positive read across to our other block that we have with Kosmos called EG-01."",
  ""We should have results on this in December."",
  ""And as a reminder, Panoro's financial exposure to this is quite modest."",
  ""We have a small stake in it, which could be meaningful in the case of a discovery."",
  ""But in the case of no oil, it is partially cost recoverable through our production sharing contract."",
  ""So this is a fiscally and economically very attractive well for us to be drilling together with Kosmos."",
  ""In Gabon, we have the Bourdon well, which for those of you who follow us for many, many years, this is the And just something about some of the recent press releases that we've made around the strategy about what we're doing here."",
  ""We recently announced the award of Block EG-23."",
  ""EG-23 sits right there at the And entering Block EG-23, we come in with existing discoveries on the block."",
  ""Our commitment on this is very, very light."",
  ""So we have a three-year license to reprocess data."",
  ""We have no drilling commitment on this."",
  ""And ultimately, we then have the option to convert that into a drilling commitment in about three years."",
  ""And it's clearly a situation where we would seek to partner with a larger oil company on this one."",
  ""We would not be carrying a large piece of equity on this one, but we think that we can certainly incubate the block and hopefully bring in some partners in due course if we're encouraged by the work that we do."",
  ""And again, this is infrastructure-led."",
  ""If we make discoveries here, we can tie into the Alba facilities and ultimately into the LNG facilities on Bioko Island."",
  ""This is a – Equatorial Guinea is a very, very large LNG producer run by Marathon Oil."",
  ""And we recently announced together with BW Energy and VAALCO the award of two blocks."",
  ""These have been pending for a little while, but we finally got them done."",
  ""And as you can see on the right there, we have the Niosi permit which is in yellow and clearly is just following the fairway between Dussafu, which we've talked about, and Etame, which is a series of fields that have already produced 150 million barrels and are continuing to produce and have plenty of reserves on them."",
  ""So we think combining the subsea – subsurface expertise of Panoro with the development expertise of both VAALCO and BW, we've really got a great joint venture here, joint venture with the state on this one as well."",
  ""And looking at just kind of gathering this area, working on reprocessing data, working up the prospects and leads and probably drilling a well certainly in the yellow license Niosi sometime in the next few years."",
  ""again, Panoro's exposure to this financially has been kept at a modest size, but we're clearly in a very, very prolific oil area here."",
  ""In the event of a discovery, oil can be delivered either to the Etame production facilities or into the Dussafu field facilities."",
  ""So a very, very sensible piece of long-term business for us due on both these assets."",
  ""So a little picture on – and the key messaging, really we have had a few years now of heavy investment, 2024 being a record investment, which is now starting to yield those results."",
  ""I think we're coming into more of a harvest period now."",
  ""Through all this development activity we've done, we've managed to grow production from 2020 at around 2,000 barrels a day to 13,000 barrels a day, at the same time guiding CapEx in and around the $40 million mark next year."",
  ""So this really – 2025 is looking to be a strong year for Panoro."",
  ""We have very good visible production growth, we think, with the long life assets."",
  ""We believe we have nice infrastructure-led catalysts as well, which continue to hopefully add to the resource base, reserve base that we already have and we're continuing with a very shareholder-focused distribution plan where the board, the management team are all aligned to reward shareholders as we go through – as we have been doing in the past and as we move through this harvesting period where we expect to continue to deliver both through return of paid in capital, which again might have certain advantages to certain shareholders and obviously through the approved buyback program."",
  ""Again, if you'd like to ask a question, raise your hand using the little hand icon there."",
  ""And if you got a question, type it in."",
  ""Again, we will endeavor to answer questions as long as they've not already been answered or if they're very, very specific."",
  ""We will ask you, if your question is not asked, to send us something, and we will endeavor to respond to it by email.""

  ""So  for taking the question."",
  ""So my first question is around capital allocation next year, balance sheet and so forth."",
  ""So CapEx will be much lower, much more cash flow."",
  ""What's in your view is the ideal cash you will keep in that period and in particular in the context of the debt?"",
  ""And I saw the announcement this morning about the And my second question is more straightforward."",
  ""Once the second EG well is on stream, where would you see gross production stabilizing at in EG?"",
  ""Perhaps back on the first one."",
  ""So ideally if we look at some sort of absolute number on the cash and the debt, what is the sort of number you have in mind?"",
  ""What do you think you need to always keep on your balance sheet in term of cash?"",
  ""So this morning, we announced that we are commencing a series of fixed income meetings over the coming days."",
  ""The logic behind that is that we believe our business has evolved."",
  ""We believe examining the bond market is a natural progression for us to diversify our sort of capital structure, access to capital, and many of our peers make use of this market as well."",
  ""We've had an excellent RBL, we feel really supportive lenders over the years."",
  ""And those relationships will continue."",
  ""But we felt that the time was right for us to get a longer term piece of capital in place that's subject to market conditions obviously."",
  ""That would sort of better reflect the maturity of our current business."",
  ""So capital allocation for next year, I think you'll see us continuing the trend that we have previous analysis."",
  ""We are looking at being very much on the front foot in terms of shareholder – allocation towards shareholders."",
  ""I'd say the difference next year as compared to when we were in our development phase is obviously given that where CapEx is coming down, our free cash flow is higher, we can withstand lower oil prices than perhaps in prior years or perhaps much more sensitive to oil price And as our portfolio matures and depending on the outcome of some of the wells that we're drilling that could create some opportunity to look at some other things The second well in EG, it's just coming online."",
  ""We don't like Hopefully, that answered the questions."",
  ""Stephane, it's quite a specific question."",
  ""I think what we always try and do is we do have working capital needs within the business."",
  ""We produce oil every day."",
  ""We don't sell it every day."",
  ""So we always try and keep a nice cushion there to deal with working capital swings."",
  ""We do have a facility that we use with Trafigura at the moment which allows us to manage those very short-term working capital swings."",
  ""And so we'll continue to make sure that we're running a very sensible business, not over-levered."",
  ""But that working capital facility is around $25 million, maybe the best way to answer your question."",
  ""Should we come back to him?"",
  ""Could you just say that again?"",
  ""What I'd like to do is ask my colleague Richard to answer your first one and tell you a little bit about kind of datas on that block."",
  ""Yeah, I mean, we do have a well commitment on the Niosi block , Sure."",
  ""And I think it's a very good question and I'm sure that people that have the same question, I think we're busy formulating that at the moment."",
  ""And again, I think the best thing I can kind of say is I think that while 2024 has been to date a year where we've continued to pay a dividend despite oil price being substantially lower than the framework, we have our complete focus now on getting through this 2024 cycle that Again, like I said, I think the positives are, I think, next year we are less sensitive to oil price and we'll continue to have debates in the board."",
  ""We had a board meeting yesterday."",
  ""And everybody is committed to being very, very proactive in keeping a really good, balanced approach between shareholder distributions and continued growth within the company."",
  ""But we will come out with more specifics on that in due course."",
  ""So, yes, the intention is to cancel those shares."",
  ""Those shares, I think from a legal perspective, they can't be canceled until the general meeting."",
  ""So we hold them in Treasury and we – the full intention is to cancel the shares, but they don't get canceled as soon as they're bought."",
  ""we have to wait for the general meeting."",
  ""So the official line is that the FPSO delivers a 40,000 barrel a day nameplate."",
  ""I think the common wisdom and that's articulated by BW Energy as well, obviously it's a BWO FPSO, is that generally speaking, the nameplate capacity can be exceeded by approximately 10%."",
  ""Obviously, if you spent a lot of money and put new topside facilities on, you could greatly expand the Adolo."",
  ""But in terms of like kind of the easy, quick fixes, debottlenecking as the term was used, there does appear to be upside potential."",
  ""And I think that the common response between us and BW at the moment on that is that we can probably do up to 10%."",
  ""As these new wells are coming online, I think anybody can do the math."",
  ""You can see that we hit 40,000 barrels a day and we still have wells to bring online."",
  ""So clearly, the productive capacity at Dussafu on paper, if I can put it that way, assuming these wells come online at decent rates, is going to be in excess of that nameplate capacity."",
  ""And I think what's actually happening right now is, I think, we're now seeing the stronger production come through, seeing how the facilities are working, how our debottlenecking is working."",
  ""So it's a little early to come out with something definitive on it, but I think it is recognized that we do have well productive capacity beyond the 40,000 barrels."",
  ""How much the vessel can handle on a sustained basis, think we're still figuring it out."",
  ""I think the main point that we try to make on this is that excess well capacity, if I can put it that way, above the 40,000 barrels at the very least what it does is it helps extend out the plateau of that production for longer."",
  ""Does it mean we can exceed it?"",
  ""Does it mean similarly that we can extend out that plateau, kind of keep the decline on a measured basis by having the ability to hold back on wells or maybe – if we're waiting for a well workover that we have some redundancy to maintain that production?"",
  ""I think that that is probably the most important foundational point to make."",
  ""I mean, we are – this is luxury problem to have at the moment."",
  ""We'll see how we do as we bring these other wells online."",
  ""And  for continuing to follow the company."",
  ""Hopefully, we've come through a very busy 2024, and hopefully, it'll be a smoother sailing into next year."",
  ""But very happy to have hit our production targets, and hopefully, things will be good from here on in."",
  ""And that concludes the Q&A for today.""

  ""This is Robert Nistico, CEO of Splash Beverage Group."",
  ""I also have Julius Ivancsits, our CFO; and Bill Meissner, our President and Chief Marketing Officer."",
  ""We appreciate everyone taking the time this morning for joining us on our quarterly  for the period ending September 30, 2024."",
  ""Before we get started, I want to reiterate why I started Splash and the investment thesis behind the business."",
  ""Splash Beverage Group is focused on identifying, acquiring, and building early stage or undervalued beverage brands with strong growth potential in both the US and international markets."",
  ""Additionally, the company operates its division, Qplash."",
  ""Its market's well-known beverage brands to both business-to-business and business-to-consumer customers, leveraging e-commerce direct for direct delivery."",
  ""The company has had its challenges, but the value proposition of creating this organization is solid, and we have built a foundation to generate attractive returns for all our shareholders."",
  ""Let me pivot now to topics that will be covered during the call."",
  ""Our agenda today, we will talk about Q3 2024 results, distribution and brand strategy, capital structure and financing update, mergers and acquisition update, and of course, the Q&A session where we look forward and hope that we have a lot of good, hard questions."",
  ""Let's begin with tailwinds and headwinds since the last update."",
  ""With regard to tailwinds, we've expanded our distribution network in numerous territories."",
  ""We're in the process of the restart of Qplash, Splash's online resell business, which began at the end of August."",
  ""Q3 2024 Splash gross margins, 30% up from 23% in Q2 2024, and 11% in Q1 2024."",
  ""Strategic sourcing programs is starting to have an impact, which is great."",
  ""Lower SG&A spending for the period, down $500,000 from Q2 2024."",
  ""Capital raise of approximately $8 million since August of 2024."",
  ""Approval of our board of directors, auditors of issue shares of stock supported by our shareholders."",
  ""Headwinds, liquidity, ongoing challenges for well over a year since 2023."",
  ""That's really been our main issue."",
  ""Maybe the TapouT lawsuit, Timing of funding, inflows, delays and liquidity impacting inventory and sales."",
  ""It's difficult on liquidity when you're – can't control the timing of the inflow of cash."",
  ""I'll now turn it over to our CFO, Julius, and we will provide an update on financial performance of the  for the update, Bill."",
  ""I want to publicly thank Bill and the commercial team for its dedication over the last year in a tough liquidity environment."",
  ""Before I provide an update on the capital raise over the last quarter or so, I also want to thank our legacy investors who continue to support the vision of Splash Beverage."",
  ""The confidence in the business and the leadership team is very much appreciated."",
  ""Okay, now on to the capital structure."",
  ""On October 16 of this year 2024, we did release a press release with the completion of the first tranche of the capital raise for our strategic acquisition."",
  ""Since August of 2024 this year, the company has secured commitments of roughly $8 million, fundraising to expand its markets and presence and support working capital."",
  ""The capital raise was achieved through private placement of convertible notes along with equity in the pending acquisition."",
  ""The capital will provide Splash Beverage Group essential working capital for its legacy business while enabling it to pursue or I should say us to pursue complementary acquisition anticipated to enhance the company's product offerings and operational efficiencies."",
  ""We continue to actively recruit investors to ensure we have the necessary liquidity to support our growth."",
  ""While the response from family office and individuals has been fantastic, timing receipt of funds has been a challenge."",
  ""To complete our retail level fundraising, we're actively working with two additional institutions to raise significant amounts of capital with targets between $7 million and $12 million."",
  ""We do need to keep the names of those parties confidential currently."",
  ""However, we do have funding engagement – we are formally engaged with two institutions look to make significant investments into Splash Beverage."",
  ""We are in the middle of the due diligence process with both organizations and look forward to having signed documents for financing before the holidays with one of the two providers if not both who best aligns for our long-term vision and creates capital structure to generate the appropriate returns on our investor base."",
  ""Once we complete the raise from both our retail and institutional investors, it will allow us to move forward with a definitive agreement with the energy drink company, which fits fantastically into our portfolio."",
  ""We anticipate this deal closing in early January."",
  ""However, with the pending holiday season and the necessary financial audit, it could be slightly longer."",
  ""However, both organizations are highly committed to transacting the deal."",
  ""Let me turn it back over to Julius with an update on , Julius."",
  ""I think the key message here, folks, is we're not sitting around waiting for liquidity."",
  ""We're doing everything we can to fine-tune the organization and prepare us for when the final funding does hit here in the very near future."",
  ""Before I provide an update on Western Son and other M&A, I'd like to provide some insight on recent transactions in the energy drink space over the last four weeks."",
  ""KDP, Keurig Dr Pepper, some of you may know, they announced their purchase of acquisition of the energy drink maker, GHOST for more than $1 billion."",
  ""And Molson Coors has taken a majority stake in ZOA, which I think was The Rock's startup."",
  ""Both announcements really confirm belief in the better-for-you energy drink space, which outperforms the broader energy drink category while both are still growing."",
  ""This gets us extremely excited about our pending acquisition in this market segment."",
  ""Our pending acquisition, we are under a letter of intent but can't disclose the name at this time."",
  ""It's the right product with great partners at a fair valuation, which will allow us to capture our fair share or I'd like to say our unfair share of the energy drink segment with highly attractive margins and a competitive overhead structure."",
  ""This dovetails nicely with Qplash, our resale business, and will provide growth north of 30% via our distribution network."",
  ""Apologies for the excitement, my voice."",
  ""As you can tell, we're very excited about this opportunity."",
  ""The gating item is the move to definitive agreements to finish securing the financing for the transaction and we secured a good As everyone is aware, we publicly announced a letter of intent with Western Son."",
  ""Western Son is an amazing vodka, was recently ranked as the number one tasting vodka by Newsweek magazine."",
  ""We're working on raising funds with 50% of , everyone, for your attention."",
  ""In summary, our issues have been 100% related to liquidity."",
  ""We're in a process of solving that, as you've heard, very quickly."",
  ""We're quite excited about it."",
  ""We'll now open up the call to questions."",
  ""Standby as questions are coming in, Robert."",
  ""As Robert previously alluded to, the headwind on liquidity and timing of inflows impacted our Q3 performance."",
  ""Q3 2024 net sales were $381,000, down slightly from Q2 2024, just a little over $1 million."",
  ""Sales declines were driven by a limited inventory due to the liquidity challenges that we mentioned previously."",
  ""It is important to note the business did restart its resale business, Qplash, in August and continues to ramp up."",
  ""This is key for our liquidity given it has short cash conversion cycles and high gross margins."",
  ""Q3 gross margins increased $244,000 from Q2 To $981,000 in Q3."",
  ""The margin improvement was driven by lower wine cost at Copa Di Vino and Qplash business, which had gross margins of 59%."",
  ""Compared to Q1 2024, gross margin percentages have almost tripled from 11% to 30%."",
  ""Q3 OpEx was down $1 million from the prior quarter driven by expense controls, elimination of the TapouT license fee, and lower share-based compensation."",
  ""EBITDA for the period was a loss of $1.7 million for the period versus a loss of $2.2 million in Q2 2024, driven by higher gross margins and lower SG&A spending."",
  ""The $1.7 million loss in the period is a $2 million improvement compared to Q3 2023."",
  ""Net loss for Q3 was $4.6 million."",
  ""This is a $700,000 improvement from prior quarter and $1 million lower than Q3 2023."",
  ""Liquidity and working capital, as previously noted, was tight for the period, but Splash did end up with a cash balance of $457,000 in the bank compared to a very nominal amount at the end of Q2 2024."",
  ""Collections were solid for the period."",
  ""Inventory was flat compared to the prior quarter as well."",
  ""I would like to turn this over to Bill Meissner, our President and CMO, to discuss commercial trends in the business, including distribution wins and brand strategy."",
  ""While the revenue was slightly down from Q2 2024, we continue to lay the foundation for growth in 2025 and beyond despite significant shipping challenges driven by liquidity, backlog orders plus shipped orders for Q3 were up 3.3% versus Q3 a year ago on Copa and 12.2% on Pulpoloco."",
  ""Actual shipped orders were up on Pulpoloco's 7.5% versus Q3 a year ago."",
  ""In past shareholder communications, we have emphasized the importance of distribution for success in our category and continue to expand our distribution network."",
  ""Copa di Vino and Pulpoloco had key Pacific Northwest distribution expansion, giving the brand's full state coverage in the state of Washington with both King Beverage and Olympic Eagle to AB wholesalers there."",
  ""We expanded our Northeast distribution covered in Massachusetts with Atlas Distributing, and we expanded our Southwest distribution coverage in the important state of Texas."",
  ""Our new distributor partner there, Reed Beverage, gives Splash now full coverage in all of West Texas, including Amarillo, Lubbock, and El Paso for all the brands."",
  ""On the retail win front, Circle K has authorized Copa di Vino for all franchised stores."",

  ""Looks like the bulk of our questions are regarding liquidity and acquisitions."",
  ""So, I'm going to make a couple general statements before I answer specific questions and I'll also have Julius who will help us here."",
  ""Regarding liquidity, again, I mentioned two or three times a minute ago, our issues have been 100% about liquidity."",
  ""One of the questions here is concern over missing timeline on acquisitions and raising funding."",
  ""I think I said this to someone earlier today."",
  ""There's no one more impatient than I am, than anyone on the planet than I am."",
  ""But with liquidity challenges, it affects all types of timelines and I mentioned a minute ago,  Regarding our current raise, yeah, we've brought on X dollars."",
  ""You've seen that in the 8-Ks and I think we've brought on another $1 million and change since then."",
  ""So, we're getting very close on that."",
  ""We do have signed documents for the balance."",
  ""Somebody wrote here just recently, they thought it was $12 million."",
  ""It's never been $12 million."",
  ""It was $8 million to $10 million and we have, as I mentioned earlier and Julius mentioned, we have Yeah."",
  ""So, a question on Bill, there's a question on Western Son."",
  ""I know we've made some progress there if you'd like to answer."",
  ""Western Son, where are we on that transaction and when do you anticipate closing on that brand?"",
  ""And just to make sure that's clear, it's a blend of equity and debt and it's a chicken and the egg situation."",
  ""Debt folks don't want to commit until the equity folks have committed and vice versa."",
  ""But it looks like we're basically there now on the debt side."",
  ""This is really important news for now the – on the equity side."",
  ""Now, the debt folks are starting to dig in again."",
  ""I think we've got some challenges with the holidays, of course, slowing things down."",
  ""So, the unnamed acquisition for the energy drink space, will it happen this year?"",
  ""Our target has always been December 15 because we'd like to capture that revenue and put it on our annual report."",
  ""But at the end of the day, that's a nice to have, not a need to have."",
  ""But again, we remain completely engaged and under letter of intent with those folks."",
  ""Once we close out the rest of the capital raise, then that triggers the audit and then we move forward."",
  ""And remember, we don't have to be fully audited."",
  ""The SEC allows 71 days to produce consolidated financials."",
  ""So, we'll close this quickly as we can, the fantastic acquisition for us, the significant amount of top line and gross revenue."",
  ""The top line number is above $30 million."",
  ""It really, really is How much – so one more question on liquidity."",
  ""So, how much money has been raised since our last press release?"",
  ""I believe it's right around $1 million."",
  ""Julius, do you have that number handy?"",
  ""Got a question about the note in default that was on our – or in technical default, I should say, that was on our Q report."",
  ""When will that be paid back?"",
  ""Those are – hang on."",
  ""Sorry, but it's just hard to read the screen."",
  ""Yeah, when will that be paid back?"",
  ""So, our intention is to pay that back as we raise additional equity in the organization through current capital raises."",
  ""There'll be plenty of cash to do that."",
  ""We'll see how that goes in the next week or so."",
  ""There's another couple of questions coming in."",
  ""Waiting for them to load."",
  ""I'll just speak for a second while that's happening."",
  ""And look, I understand everybody's impatient."",
  ""Like I said, as I am, this has been a difficult year for I got to tell you."",
  ""We appreciate our shareholders so much and hanging in there while we're fixing the liquidity challenge."",
  ""Can't  guys enough for hanging in there with us and it's another Western Son question."",
  ""Basically,  for the information on the timing."",
  ""Yeah, we can't disclose Next question."",
  ""Why won't you release the name of the energy drink target?"",

  ""At this point, we're trying to finalize the raise."",
  ""We've made great progress on – we're dividing it between a debt and equity raise."",
  ""And on the equity raise, we've made excellent progress and are essentially there."",
  ""You have to marry both elements at the same time."",
  ""So, we're circling back on the debt front and trying to get that completed."",
  ""It will go fast once that's done, but this is – at this point, with the holidays, it is correct to assume that it could leak into Q1."",
  ""And I think presuming that we make good progress by year-end, the Western Son team will continue to work with us on an extension."",
  ""But that is just me speculating, but I believe they would."",
  ""I don't have the exact dates as the PR, but we're kind of like a little bit over $8 million on commitments from various stakeholders.""
