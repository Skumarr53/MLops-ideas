## USER
I have a natural language inference (NLI) use case and I want to regularly fine-tune the DeBERTa-v3-large-zeroshot-v2 model using updated data configured in Databricks. I would like to utilize MLflow to version and store the model, facilitate transitions between different environments, and monitor model performance. I have three environments: training/development, staging, and production. I want to set up MLflow for all of these environments to ensure smoother model management and transitions.

Could you provide me with comprehensive setup instructions for integrating MLflow with Databricks to meet my requirements?

## ASSISTANT
Integrating MLflow with Databricks to manage, version, and transition your fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3-large-zeroshot-v2 NLI model across training/development, staging, and production environments involves several key steps. Below is a comprehensive guide to help you set up this integration effectively.

---

## **1. Prerequisites**

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- **Databricks Workspace**: Access to a Databricks workspace with appropriate permissions.
- **Databricks Cluster**: A running cluster with necessary libraries installed (e.g., `transformers`, `torch`, `mlflow`).
- **MLflow Knowledge**: Basic understanding of MLflow components like Tracking, Projects, and Model Registry.
- **Access to Data**: Your NLI training and testing datasets stored in accessible storage (e.g., DBFS).

---

## **2. Setting Up MLflow Tracking in Databricks**

Databricks integrates seamlessly with MLflow, providing built-in support for tracking experiments. Here's how to set it up:

### **a. Initialize MLflow in Your Notebook**

Start by initializing MLflow in your Databricks notebook where you'll perform model training.

```python
import mlflow
import mlflow.pytorch
from transformers import pipeline
import torch
import pandas as pd

# Set the experiment name (creates one if it doesn't exist)
mlflow.set_experiment("/Users/your_username/NLI_FineTuning_Experiment")
```

### **b. Configure MLflow Tracking URI (Optional)**

By default, Databricks manages the MLflow tracking server. If you need to set a custom tracking URI, configure it accordingly.

```python
mlflow.set_tracking_uri("databricks")
```

---

## **3. Organizing the Training/Development Environment**

This environment is where you'll fine-tune your model and log experiments.

### **a. Structure Your Fine-Tuning Script with MLflow Logging**

Integrate MLflow logging into your fine-tuning process to capture parameters, metrics, and models.

```python
# Start an MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run(run_name="Fine-tune_DeBERTa_v3") as run:
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("model_name", "deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2")
    mlflow.log_param("num_train_epochs", 3)
    mlflow.log_param("learning_rate", 2e-5)
    mlflow.log_param("weight_decay", 0.01)
    mlflow.log_param("per_device_train_batch_size", 16)
    
    # Define device
    device = 0 if torch.cuda.is_available() else -1

    # Initialize the pipeline
    model_folder_path = "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Libraries/HuggingFace/"
    model_1_folder_name = "deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2"
    db0_classifier = pipeline("zero-shot-classification", model=model_folder_path + model_1_folder_name)
    
    # Save training and testing data
    new_train_df.to_csv("/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v3.csv", index=False)
    new_test_df.to_csv("/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_test_v3.csv", index=False)
    
    # Execute fine-tuning command
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run([
        "python", "run_glue.py",
        "--model_name_or_path", f"{model_folder_path}{model_1_folder_name}",
        "--output_dir", "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/Fine-tune NLI models/trained_RD_deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2_v3",
        "--train_file", "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v3.csv",
        "--validation_file", "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_test_v3.csv",
        "--do_train",
        "--do_eval",
        "--num_train_epochs", "3",
        "--fp16",
        "--report_to", "none",
        "--learning_rate", "2e-5",
        "--weight_decay", "0.01",
        "--per_device_train_batch_size", "16",
        "--per_device_eval_batch_size", "16"
    ], check=True)
    
    # After training, load the fine-tuned model
    fine_tuned_model_path = "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/Fine-tune NLI models/trained_RD_deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2_v3"
    model = mlflow.pytorch.load_model(fine_tuned_model_path)
    
    # Evaluate model (example: log accuracy)
    # Replace with your evaluation logic
    accuracy = 0.95  # Placeholder
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
    
    # Log the fine-tuned model
    mlflow.pytorch.log_model(model, "model")
```

### **b. Commit and Track Your Code**

Ensure your training scripts are version-controlled (e.g., using Git) to track changes alongside MLflow experiments.

---

## **4. Setting Up the MLflow Model Registry**

The Model Registry allows you to manage model versions and their lifecycle stages (e.g., Staging, Production).

### **a. Access the Model Registry**

In Databricks:

1. Navigate to the **MLflow** section in the sidebar.
2. Click on **Models**.
3. Create a new model if it doesn't exist by selecting **Register Model**.

### **b. Register the Fine-Tuned Model**

After logging the model in your training run, register it to the Model Registry.

```python
# Get the run ID
run_id = run.info.run_id

# Register the model
model_name = "DeBERTa_v3_NLI_Model"
model_uri = f"runs:/{run_id}/model"

registered_model = mlflow.register_model(model_uri, model_name)
```

### **c. Transition Model Stages**

Automate or manually transition models between stages based on validation.

```python
from mlflow.tracking import MlflowClient

client = MlflowClient()

# Approve the model and transition to Staging
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name=model_name,
    version=registered_model.version,
    stage="Staging",
    archive_existing_versions=True
)

# After further validation, promote to Production
client.transition_model_version_stage(
    name=model_name,
    version=registered_model.version,
    stage="Production",
    archive_existing_versions=True
)
```

**Note**: Transitioning stages can be automated using Databricks Jobs or managed manually via the MLflow UI based on your validation criteria.

---

## **5. Configuring Staging and Production Environments**

### **a. Define Environment-Specific Settings**

Maintain separate configurations for each environment to manage differences like data paths, hyperparameters, or deployment targets.

```python
import os

ENV = os.getenv("ENVIRONMENT", "development")  # Set ENVIRONMENT variable accordingly

if ENV == "development":
    model_stage = "None"
    data_path = "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/"
elif ENV == "staging":
    model_stage = "Staging"
    data_path = "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/Staging_Data/"
elif ENV == "production":
    model_stage = "Production"
    data_path = "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/Production_Data/"
```

### **b. Deploy Models to Different Environments**

Use MLflowâ€™s Model Registry to fetch models based on their stage and deploy them accordingly.

```python
# Load the production model
production_model = mlflow.pyfunc.load_model(
    model_uri=f"models:/{model_name}/Production"
)

# Use the production model for inference
predictions = production_model.predict(new_data)
```

---

## **6. Automating Model Training and Deployment with Databricks Jobs**

To ensure regular fine-tuning and seamless transitions, automate the training and deployment pipeline using Databricks Jobs.

### **a. Create a Notebook for Training and Registration**

Structure your notebook to perform training, logging, and model registration as outlined in previous sections.

### **b. Schedule the Job**

1. Go to the **Jobs** section in Databricks.
2. Click on **Create Job**.
3. Configure the job:
   - **Name**: e.g., "NLI Model Fine-Tuning"
   - **Task**: Select the training notebook.
   - **Schedule**: Set the frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - **Cluster**: Choose an existing cluster or create a new one.

### **c. Add Job Tasks for Deployment**

Optionally, add downstream tasks to transition model stages or deploy to production after successful training.

---

## **7. Monitoring Model Performance with MLflow**

Monitoring ensures that your production models maintain expected performance metrics.

### **a. Log Performance Metrics**

During training, log relevant metrics such as accuracy, loss, F1-score, etc.

```python
mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
mlflow.log_metric("f1_score", f1_score)
```

### **b. Set Up Alerts and Dashboards**

Use Databricks and MLflowâ€™s built-in visualization tools to create dashboards:

1. **Create MLflow Experiments Dashboard**:
   - Visualize metrics over different runs.
   - Compare model versions.

2. **Integrate with Monitoring Tools**:
   - Optionally, integrate MLflow with tools like Datadog or Prometheus for advanced monitoring and alerting.

### **c. Implement Model Validation Checks**

Before promoting a model to production, implement validation checks to ensure performance criteria are met.

```python
if accuracy >= 0.90:
    # Promote to Staging
    client.transition_model_version_stage(
        name=model_name,
        version=registered_model.version,
        stage="Staging",
        archive_existing_versions=True
    )
else:
    print("Model did not meet accuracy requirements.")
```

---

## **8. Managing Transitions Between Environments**

Effectively managing model transitions ensures stability and reliability in production.

### **a. Utilize MLflow Model Registry Stages**

Use the Model Registry to handle transitions:

- **Development**: Initial fine-tuned models.
- **Staging**: Models that have passed initial validation.
- **Production**: Fully validated and deployed models.

### **b. Automate Transitions Using Scripts or Jobs**

Incorporate stage transitions into your training scripts or as separate job tasks.

```python
def promote_model(model_name, version, target_stage):
    client.transition_model_version_stage(
        name=model_name,
        version=version,
        stage=target_stage,
        archive_existing_versions=True
    )

# Example usage
promote_model(model_name, registered_model.version, "Staging")
```

---

## **9. Best Practices and Considerations**

### **a. Version Control**

Ensure all your code, including notebooks and scripts, are version-controlled using Git or Databricks Repos.

### **b. Reproducibility**

Log all parameters, dependencies, and environments to ensure experiments are reproducible.

```python
# Log dependencies
mlflow.log_artifact("requirements.txt")
```

### **c. Security and Access Control**

Manage access to the MLflow Model Registry and experiments based on roles to ensure security.

### **d. Scalability**

As your model and data grow, consider optimizing storage and compute resources. Utilize Databricksâ€™ autoscaling features for clusters.

### **e. Documentation**

Maintain clear documentation of your MLflow experiments, model stages, and deployment processes to facilitate team collaboration.

By adhering to these practices, you'll establish a robust and scalable machine learning pipeline tailored to your NLI use case.

## USER

- What is the purpose of the MLflow experiment name and run ID?
- Is the data path for different stages used in model validation, and can it be the same or different across all environments?
- How will the transition occur within Databricks? I understand you provided code for this, but I'm unsure how it will work in production and staging environments. Should we execute the code manually to transition between environments, or can we use the Databricks MLflow registry interface for this?
- Is there a way to compare whether the existing model is better than the new model, which will help decide whether to move to the next environment?
- When executing `mlflow.register_model`, how does the transition work in the backend to move from one environment to another? I believe it will replace the existing model with the new one in the specified path.

For the above questions, please keep the responses short and concise.

- Finally, please generate a comprehensive report on the steps for managing the model from development to production using MLflow on Databricks. This report should be suitable for presentation to a non-technical manager and should avoid overly technical language.

## ASSISTANT
### **1. Purpose of the MLflow Experiment Name and Run ID**

- **Experiment Name**: Groups related machine learning runs together, allowing you to organize and compare different training experiments systematically.
- **Run ID**: Uniquely identifies each individual training run within an experiment, enabling you to track specific runs, their parameters, metrics, and artifacts separately.

### **2. Data Path for Different Stages in Model Validation**

- **Usage in Validation**: Data paths can be used to separate datasets for development, staging, and production to ensure each environment tests the model under appropriate conditions.
- **Same or Different**: They can be either the same or different across environments, depending on your workflow. Using different paths can help isolate environments and prevent data overlap, enhancing validation accuracy.

### **3. Transitioning Models Within Databricks**

- **Automation vs. Manual**:
  - **Manual Transition**: You can use the MLflow Model Registry interface within Databricks to manually promote models between stages (e.g., from staging to production).
  - **Automated Transition**: Alternatively, you can incorporate transition steps into your training scripts or Databricks Jobs to automate the process based on predefined criteria.

### **4. Comparing Existing Model with New Model**

- **Comparison Methods**:
  - **Metrics Evaluation**: Compare performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score) logged by MLflow for both models.
  - **Automated Tools**: Use MLflowâ€™s built-in comparison features to visualize and assess which model performs better.
- **Decision Making**: Based on the comparison, decide whether the new model meets or exceeds the performance of the existing one before promoting it to the next environment.

### **5. Transitioning Models with `mlflow.register_model`**

- **Backend Process**:
  - **Registration**: When you execute `mlflow.register_model`, the model is added to the MLflow Model Registry under a specified name.
  - **Stage Assignment**: You assign the model to a stage (e.g., Staging, Production) without replacing existing models. Multiple versions can exist, each tagged with different stages.
  - **Version Control**: The new model version is tracked separately, allowing you to manage and switch between different model versions seamlessly without overwriting.

provide a scenrios for better understanding 

- Groups related machine learning runs together, allowing you to organize and compare different training experiments systematically.
- Data paths can be used to separate datasets for development, staging, and production to ensure each environment tests the model under appropriate conditions.

### **Code Review and Enhancement for MLflow Setup**

Thank you for sharing your MLflow setup code. I've reviewed it carefully based on your requirements and our previous discussions. Below, I outline the observations, identify missing elements, and provide a revised version of your code incorporating the necessary functionalities.

---

### **Key Observations and Identified Issues**

1. **Naming Consistency**:
   - **Issue**: The code references `finbert` and `RegisterBERTModel`, which seem unrelated to your DeBERTa model.
   - **Solution**: Update all references to align with the DeBERTa model (`deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2`).

2. **Logging Parameters and Metrics**:
   - **Issue**: The training script lacks logging of parameters, metrics, and artifacts essential for MLflow tracking.
   - **Solution**: Integrate MLflow logging within the training process to capture necessary information.

3. **Performance Comparison**:
   - **Issue**: There's no mechanism to compare the existing model with the new one to decide on transitioning.
   - **Solution**: Implement performance evaluation and comparison logic to automate transition decisions.

4. **Error Handling and Code Corrections**:
   - **Issue**: In `ModelVersionManager.manage_model_version_transitions`, the variable `manager` is undefined; it should reference `self`.
   - **Solution**: Correct variable references and enhance error handling where necessary.

5. **Integration of Classes**:
   - **Issue**: The classes (`MLFlowModel`, `ModelTransitioner`, `ModelMetaData`, `ModelVersionManager`, and `ModelManager`) are defined but not cohesively integrated into the training pipeline.
   - **Solution**: Ensure that these classes interact seamlessly within the training and deployment workflow.

6. **Undefined References**:
   - **Issue**: References to `RegisterBERTModel` and `config` are present without definitions.
   - **Solution**: Define or replace these references with appropriate classes or configurations relevant to your setup.

---

### **Revised Code with Enhancements**

Below is the revised version of your MLflow setup code, incorporating the necessary functionalities and addressing the identified issues.

### **Enhancements and Additions Explained**

1. **Naming Consistency**:
   - Updated all class and variable names to reflect the DeBERTa model (`DeBERTa_v3_NLI_Model`) instead of `finbert` or `BERT`.

2. **Configuration Management**:
   - Introduced a `Config` dataclass to centralize all configuration settings, making it easier to manage and modify paths and names.

3. **Logging Parameters and Metrics**:
   - Added `log_params` and `log_metrics` within the `register_model` method to capture training parameters and evaluation metrics.
   - Implemented placeholder methods `get_training_params` and `evaluate_model` which should be replaced with actual training and evaluation logic.

4. **Performance Comparison**:
   - Implemented `compare_models` within `ModelVersionManager` to compare development and production models based on metrics like accuracy.
   - The `manage_model_version_transitions` method now uses this comparison to decide whether to transition the model to staging.

5. **Error Handling and Code Corrections**:
   - Fixed the undefined `manager` variable by replacing it with `self` within the `ModelVersionManager`.
   - Enhanced error messages and logging for better traceability.

6. **Integration of Classes**:
   - Provided an example usage scenario in the `__main__` block to demonstrate how `ModelManager` and `ModelVersionManager` interact within the workflow.
   - Ensured that model registration, transition, loading, and prediction are cohesively integrated.

7. **Model Loading and Prediction**:
   - Ensured that the `ModelManager` class handles loading models from the `Production` stage and provides a `predict` method for inference.
   - Added checks to ensure the model is loaded before making predictions.

8. **Tagging Models**:
   - Incorporated model tagging within the `ModelTransitioner` to label models based on their stages, aiding in better organization and retrieval.

9. **Documentation and Comments**:
   - Added comprehensive docstrings and comments to explain the purpose and functionality of each class and method, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

---

### **Additional Recommendations**

1. **Automate Training and Deployment Pipelines**:
   - Consider using Databricks Jobs to schedule and automate the training, registration, and transition processes, ensuring regular fine-tuning with updated data.

2. **Implement Actual Training and Evaluation Logic**:
   - Replace placeholder methods (`get_training_params`, `evaluate_model`) with actual implementations that interact with your training scripts and evaluation metrics.

3. **Performance Monitoring**:
   - Integrate monitoring tools to track model performance in real-time, enabling proactive management and quick responses to any performance degradation.

4. **Version Control Integration**:
   - Ensure that all scripts and configurations are version-controlled using Git or Databricks Repos to maintain a history of changes and facilitate collaboration.

5. **Secure Configuration Management**:
   - Use Databricks Secrets or environment variables to manage sensitive configurations and credentials securely.

6. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - Optimize storage and compute resources as your data and model complexity grow, leveraging Databricks' autoscaling features.

### **Conclusion**

The revised code now aligns with your requirements for managing the DeBERTa NLI model across development, staging, and production environments using MLflow within Databricks. It incorporates essential functionalities such as parameter and metric logging, model versioning, performance comparison, and automated transitions. By following this enhanced setup, you can achieve a streamlined and efficient machine learning pipeline, ensuring robust model management and deployment.

Feel free to further customize the placeholder methods and configurations to fit your specific use case and infrastructure.

## USER
Please create a standalone function for the complete MLflow setup with the following modifications:

- During the transition stage, instead of comparing accuracy or other metrics with the existing model, simply check if the metric is greater than 0.9 to determine if the model should move to the next stage.
- In the staging environment, the validation data will be stored at a specified path, which will remain constant and not change. In the development environment, the data path may vary.
- The entire process from development to production should be automated using MLflow:
  - In the development phase, if there are multiple runs, select the best run and transition it to staging.
  - In the staging phase, load the model and run the validation data; if the metric exceeds 0.9, then move the model to production.


Then, please create a code snippet to utilize the functions to intergarte the MLflow setup for eaxmple model I provided in teh beginning. 

If you believe that breaking the code into several modules would enhance maintainability and modularity, feel free to do so.

## ASSISTANT
### **Standalone Function for Complete MLflow Setup**

Below is a comprehensive, standalone function-based setup for managing your MLflow workflow in Databricks, tailored to your requirements. The setup automates the transition of your DeBERTa-v3-large-zeroshot-v2 NLI model from development to staging and then to production based on performance metrics.

#### **Key Features:**

1. **Automated Transitions:**
   - **Development to Staging:** Selects the best run from development experiments and transitions it to staging if its accuracy exceeds 0.9.
   - **Staging to Production:** Validates the model in staging using a constant validation data path and transitions it to production if its accuracy exceeds 0.9.

2. **Data Path Management:**
   - **Development Environment:** Allows dynamic data paths.
   - **Staging Environment:** Utilizes a fixed validation data path.

3. **MLflow Integration:**
   - Logs parameters, metrics, and models.
   - Utilizes MLflow Model Registry for versioning and stage transitions.

4. **Modularity and Maintainability:**
   - Organized into clear, reusable functions.
   - Comprehensive logging for easy monitoring and debugging.

# COMMAND ----------

### **Usage Example**

Below is an example of how to utilize the `manage_mlflow_workflow` function with your DeBERTa-v3-large-zeroshot-v2 NLI model. This example assumes that you have multiple training datasets for development and a fixed validation dataset for staging.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import os

# Define the configuration
config = Config(
    experiment_name="/Users/your_username/NLI_FineTuning_Experiment",
    registered_model_name="DeBERTa_v3_NLI_Model",
    training_script_path="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/train_nli_model.py",  # Replace with your actual training script path
    development_data_paths=[
        "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v1.csv",
        "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v2.csv",
        "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v3.csv"
    ],
    staging_validation_data_path="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_validation.csv",  # Fixed path for staging validation
    model_name_or_path="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Libraries/HuggingFace/deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2",
    output_dir="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/Fine-tune_NLI_models/trained_RD_deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    batch_size=16
)

# Execute the MLflow workflow
manage_mlflow_workflow(config)
```

#### **Explanation of the Usage Example:**

1. **Configuration Setup:**
   - **experiment_name:** The MLflow experiment path where all runs will be logged.
   - **registered_model_name:** The name under which the model will be registered in the MLflow Model Registry.
   - **training_script_path:** Path to your training script (`run_glue.py` in your initial code). Ensure this script logs metrics to MLflow or adjust the `train_model` function accordingly.
   - **development_data_paths:** List of training data paths for different development runs. Each path corresponds to a separate training run.
   - **staging_validation_data_path:** Fixed path for validation data in the staging environment.
   - **model_name_or_path:** Path to the pre-trained DeBERTa model.
   - **output_dir:** Directory where the fine-tuned models will be saved.
   - **num_train_epochs, learning_rate, weight_decay, batch_size:** Training hyperparameters.

2. **Executing the Workflow:**
   - **Initialization:** Sets up the MLflow experiment.
   - **Development Phase:** Iterates through each training data path, runs training, and logs each run to MLflow.
   - **Selection and Transition to Staging:** Selects the best run based on accuracy and transitions it to the staging stage if its accuracy exceeds 0.9.
   - **Validation in Staging:** Loads the model from staging, evaluates it on the fixed validation dataset, and transitions it to production if the validation accuracy exceeds 0.9.

#### **Notes and Recommendations:**

- **Training Script (`train_nli_model.py`):**
  - Ensure that your training script logs the trained model and metrics (especially `accuracy`) to MLflow. You can use `mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy_value)` within your training script.
  
- **Model Registration:**
  - The `transition_model` function registers the model from the best run and transitions it to the specified stage if the accuracy condition is met.
  
- **Validation Logic:**
  - The `validate_model_in_staging` function assumes that your validation data contains `text` and `label` columns. Adjust the prediction and evaluation logic as per your actual data structure.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - The functions include basic error handling and logging. You can enhance this further based on your specific requirements.

- **Automation:**
  - To automate this workflow, consider scheduling the execution of the `manage_mlflow_workflow` function using Databricks Jobs, ensuring regular fine-tuning and deployment of your NLI models.

#### **Breaking Into Modules for Enhanced Maintainability**

For better maintainability and modularity, you can split the code into separate modules/files as follows:

1. **config.py:** Contains the `Config` class.
2. **mlflow_utils.py:** Contains helper functions like `initialize_experiment`, `train_model`, `select_best_run`, `transition_model`, and `validate_model_in_staging`.
3. **workflow.py:** Contains the `manage_mlflow_workflow` function.
4. **main.py:** Contains the usage example and executes the workflow.

**Example Directory Structure:**

```
project/
â”œâ”€â”€ config.py
â”œâ”€â”€ mlflow_utils.py
â”œâ”€â”€ workflow.py
â””â”€â”€ main.py
```

**Example `main.py`:**

```python
from config import Config
from workflow import manage_mlflow_workflow

# Define the configuration
config = Config(
    experiment_name="/Users/your_username/NLI_FineTuning_Experiment",
    registered_model_name="DeBERTa_v3_NLI_Model",
    training_script_path="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/train_nli_model.py",
    development_data_paths=[
        "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v1.csv",
        "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v2.csv",
        "/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_train_v3.csv"
    ],
    staging_validation_data_path="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/NLI_role_training_data/Role_FT_validation.csv",
    model_name_or_path="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Libraries/HuggingFace/deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2",
    output_dir="/dbfs/mnt/access_work/UC25/Topic Modeling/NLI Models/Fine-tune_NLI_models/trained_RD_deberta-v3-large-zeroshot-v2",
    num_train_epochs=3,
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    batch_size=16
)

# Execute the MLflow workflow
manage_mlflow_workflow(config)
```

This modular approach enhances code readability, reusability, and maintainability, making it easier to manage complex workflows.
