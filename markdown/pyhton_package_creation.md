When transitioning your data engineering tasks from raw Python code in Jupyter notebooks to a script-based format and packaging it as a Python package (even for private/internal use), adhering to best practices is crucial. Below is a checklist of best practices to follow while developing a Python package:

### 1\. *Project Structure and Organization*

 - *Use a Standard Directory Layout:* Organize your package with a standard structure, such as:
    
```    
    my_package/
    ├── my_package/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── module1.py
    │   ├── module2.py
    ├── tests/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── test_module1.py
    ├── setup.py
    ├── README.md
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── .gitignore
    └── requirements.txt
```
    
 - *__init__.py files:* Ensure every directory that should be treated as a package contains an __init__.py file (it can be empty).

### 2\. *Code Quality and Style*

 - *Follow PEP 8:* Use the Python Enhancement Proposal 8 (PEP 8) style guide for writing clean, readable code.
 - *Linting:* Use tools like flake8 or pylint to automatically check your code for style guide adherence and potential errors.
 - *Type Hinting:* Use type hints to specify expected data types, which helps with readability and tooling support (e.g., mypy for static type checking).

### 3\. *Documentation*

 - *Docstrings:* Include docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions using the standard format (e.g., Google, NumPy, or reStructuredText).
 - *README File:* Provide a detailed README.md file that explains the package's purpose, installation instructions, usage examples, and any dependencies.
 - *API Documentation:* Use tools like Sphinx to generate API documentation from your docstrings if your package has complex functionality.

### 4\. *Dependency Management*

 - *requirements.txt:* List all necessary dependencies in a requirements.txt file for easy installation.
 - *Use Virtual Environments:* Develop and test your package in a virtual environment to ensure no unnecessary dependencies are included.
 - *Pin Dependencies:* Consider pinning specific versions of dependencies in requirements.txt to avoid compatibility issues (use tools like pip-tools for dependency management).

### 5\. *Testing*

 - *Unit Tests:* Write unit tests for your package using a testing framework like pytest or unittest.
 - *Test Coverage:* Aim for high test coverage, using tools like coverage.py to track which parts of your code are being tested.
 - *Continuous Testing:* Integrate continuous testing into your development workflow to run tests automatically whenever code is changed.

### 6\. *Version Control and Versioning*

 - *Git:* Use a version control system like Git to track changes to your codebase.
 - *Semantic Versioning:* Follow semantic versioning (e.g., 1.0.0) to indicate major, minor, and patch changes.

### 7\. *Packaging and Distribution*

 - *setup.py Configuration:* Use setuptools to define your package in setup.py. Include metadata like name, version, author, and license.
 - *MANIFEST.in:* Specify any additional files (e.g., data files) that need to be included in the package distribution.
 - *Building the Package:* Use setuptools or poetry to build your package (python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel).

### 8\. *Security and Licensing*

 - *Licensing:* Even for internal use, include a LICENSE file to define usage rights.
 - *Avoid Hardcoding Secrets:* Use environment variables or configuration management tools to handle sensitive information like API keys.

### 9\. *Logging and Error Handling*

 - *Logging:* Implement logging instead of print statements using Python’s built-in logging module for better control and monitoring.
 - *Error Handling:* Use try-except blocks to handle exceptions gracefully and provide meaningful error messages.

### 10\. *Environment Configuration*

 - *Config Files:* Use configuration files (e.g., .ini, .yaml, .json) to manage environment-specific settings.
 - *Environment Variables:* Consider using environment variables for settings that might change between environments (development, testing, production).

### 11\. *Automation and CI/CD*

 - *Automate Testing and Deployment:* Use CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment of your package.
 - *Automated Builds:* Use tools like Docker to create isolated, reproducible environments for building and deploying your package.

### 12\. *Code Review and Collaboration*

 - *Code Reviews:* Implement a code review process to maintain code quality and catch issues early.
 - *Collaboration Tools:* Use tools like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket for collaborative development.

### 13\. *Refactoring and Optimization*

 - *Regular Refactoring:* Regularly refactor code to improve readability, reduce complexity, and optimize performance.
 - *Performance Monitoring:* Monitor the performance of your package using profiling tools to identify and optimize slow code sections.

### 14\. *Final Deployment Checklist*

 - *Run Tests:* Ensure all tests pass before deploying.
 - *Review Documentation:* Update and review documentation for accuracy.
 - *Version Bump:* Increment the version number in a controlled manner before each release.

### 15\. *Additional Considerations for Internal Packages*

 - *Access Control:* Implement access control for sensitive parts of the package if needed.
 - *Internal Distribution:* Use internal package repositories (e.g., private PyPI, Artifactory) for distribution within your organization.

By adhering to these best practices, you will create a robust, maintainable, and scalable Python package that can be efficiently used and extended within your organization.


# Files and configuration
Refactor the codebase by organizing it into modular files and directories, categorizing functions, constants, and configurations logically, following best software engineering practices to improve code readability, maintainability, and scalability. Additionally, determine the best locations to store these components and suggest full paths for their placement
