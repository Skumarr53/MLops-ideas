To achieve consistent embeddings across multiple runs of a Word2Vec model, especially in a distributed environment like Databricks with a multi-worker node cluster, there are multiple factors to consider:

1.  **Random Seed**: Setting the `seed` parameter for the model initialization will help control the randomization for Word2Vec's internal operations.
    
2.  **Worker Initialization**: In distributed settings, ensuring deterministic behavior across different workers can be challenging, as each worker can introduce its own source of randomness. This requires synchronizing and controlling randomness across the entire cluster.
    
3.  **Gensim Version**: Depending on the version of Gensim you are using, the behavior might vary slightly regarding how randomness is controlled.
    

To help you achieve determinism in training the Word2Vec model, try the following approach:

1.  **Set Random Seeds Consistently**: Set the random seed for the Word2Vec model and the underlying numpy environment. Ensure that this is done consistently across all workers.
    
2.  **Disable Multi-threading for Training**: In some cases, training across multiple cores or workers can lead to nondeterministic results. For verification, train the model with a single worker first and then experiment with the multi-worker setup.
    

Here's a solution script that you can run on Databricks to train a consistent Word2Vec model:

```python

from gensim.models import Word2Vec
import numpy as np
import random
import os

# Set the random seeds to make the process reproducible
seed = 42
random.seed(seed)
np.random.seed(seed)
os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = str(seed)

# Sample training data
sentences = [
    ['data', 'science', 'is', 'amazing'],
    ['machine', 'learning', 'is', 'powerful'],
    ['word', 'embedding', 'is', 'useful'],
    ['data', 'is', 'valuable'],
]

# Word2Vec Model Training with Reproducibility settings
def train_word2vec(sentences, seed):
    # Initialize the model
    model = Word2Vec(
        sentences,
        vector_size=100,
        window=5,
        min_count=1,
        workers=1,  # For reproducibility, using single worker
        sg=1,  # Skip-gram model
        seed=seed  # Set the seed to control the randomness
    )

    # Train the model
    model.train(sentences, total_examples=model.corpus_count, epochs=10)
    
    return model

# Train model and save word vectors
model = train_word2vec(sentences, seed)
model.save("word2vec_reproducible.model")

# Verify reproducibility
def verify_reproducibility(sentences, seed):
    # Load the saved model
    model_1 = Word2Vec.load("word2vec_reproducible.model")
    
    # Train a new model
    model_2 = train_word2vec(sentences, seed)
    
    # Compare embeddings
    word = 'data'
    embedding_1 = model_1.wv[word]
    embedding_2 = model_2.wv[word]
    
    # Compare the embeddings for equality
    comparison = np.allclose(embedding_1, embedding_2)
    print(f"Are the embeddings for the word '{word}' identical?: {comparison}")

# Verify if reproducibility is achieved
verify_reproducibility(sentences, seed)
```

### Explanation:

1.  **Random Seed Setting**:
    
    *   I used `random.seed()`, `np.random.seed()`, and set `os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED']` to ensure consistent initialization of randomness.
2.  **Word2Vec Parameters**:
    
    *   `seed`: Set a fixed seed to ensure consistent training initialization.
    *   `workers=1`: Multi-threading can introduce nondeterminism. To verify consistency, setting `workers=1` is necessary initially.
3.  **Verification**:
    
    *   A function `verify_reproducibility()` is used to compare word embeddings after training two models. Using `np.allclose()`, it checks if the embeddings are identical.

### Running in a Distributed Environment:

In a Databricks multi-worker cluster, achieving determinism can be tricky. To better control it:

1.  Train initially on a single worker to validate that your settings are correct.
2.  If scaling to multiple workers, try ensuring that each worker initializes consistently. However, it may be challenging to achieve perfect determinism across workers due to non-sequential execution and gradient differences.
