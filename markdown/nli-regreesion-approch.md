*   **Key Points**
    
    *   You can convert the NLI task from a strict classification setting (entailment vs. non-entailment) to a regression setting (continuous degree of association).
    *   This involves modifying both the data labels (use real numbers in \[0, 1\] instead of discrete classes) and the training objective (e.g., Mean Squared Error rather than Cross-Entropy).
    *   Frameworks like Hugging Face’s Transformers can be adapted by changing the final classification head and the loss function.
    *   Proper data preprocessing and label normalization are essential to ensure a smooth transition from binary labels to continuous scores.
*   **High-Level Approach**
    
    1.  **Data Label Transformation**
        
        *   Map your original labels to real-valued scores. For instance, “entailment” could be 1.0, “contradiction” 0.0, and “neutral” something in between (e.g., 0.5).
        *   If you already have some “degree of association” metric or human-annotated data on a scale, normalize it to a \[0, 1\] range.
    2.  **Model Architecture Modification**
        
        *   Replace your classification head (which typically outputs a probability distribution over discrete classes) with a regression head that outputs a single scalar.
        *   For example, in Hugging Face Transformers, you can subclass the pretrained model, create a `nn.Linear(hidden_size, 1)` layer, and use that for your final output.
    3.  **Loss Function Swap**
        
        *   Instead of `CrossEntropyLoss`, use a regression-appropriate loss function like `MSELoss` (Mean Squared Error) or `L1Loss` (Mean Absolute Error).
        *   Example:
            
            ```python
            from torch import nn
            loss_fn = nn.MSELoss()
            ```
            
        *   This ensures the model is optimized to minimize the difference between predicted continuous values and the gold labels.
    4.  **Training Loop Adjustments**
        
        *   During training, feed your input pairs (premise, hypothesis) through the model to obtain a single scalar output.
        *   Compute the loss with respect to the gold score:
            
            ```python
            outputs = model(input_ids, attention_mask=mask)
            logits = outputs.logits.view(-1)  # shape: (batch_size,)
            loss = loss_fn(logits, labels)    # labels also shape: (batch_size,)
            ```
            
        *   The rest of the training loop remains similar to standard training, except you’re minimizing MSE rather than cross-entropy.
    5.  **Evaluation and Metrics**
        
        *   For continuous outputs, you might rely on metrics like Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation, or RMSE (root mean squared error) rather than accuracy or F1.
        *   You can define thresholds if you still need a binary or multi-class classification notion at inference, but the continuous metric is more flexible and nuanced.
*   **Illustrative Numeric Example**
    
    *   Suppose you have these example label mappings:
        
        Sentence Pair
        
        Label (Discretized)
        
        (Premise, Hypothesis) #1
        
        1.0 (Highly related)
        
        (Premise, Hypothesis) #2
        
        0.7 (Moderately)
        
        (Premise, Hypothesis) #3
        
        0.2 (Weakly related)
        
        (Premise, Hypothesis) #4
        
        0.0 (Not related)
        
    *   If the model predicts outputs like `[0.95, 0.64, 0.30, 0.05]`, your MSE for these four samples would be:
        
        MSE\=(1.0−0.95)2+(0.7−0.64)2+(0.2−0.30)2+(0.0−0.05)24\\text{MSE} = \\frac{(1.0 - 0.95)^2 + (0.7 - 0.64)^2 + (0.2 - 0.30)^2 + (0.0 - 0.05)^2}{4}MSE\=4(1.0−0.95)2+(0.7−0.64)2+(0.2−0.30)2+(0.0−0.05)2​
    *   This numeric feedback loop helps the model learn finer-grained distinctions.
        
*   **Code Outline Using Hugging Face**
    
    ```python
    from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
    from torch import nn
    import torch
    
    class RegressionModelForNLI(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, model_name):
            super().__init__()
            self.base_model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
                model_name,
                num_labels=1  # Single scalar output
            )
        
        def forward(self, **kwargs):
            outputs = self.base_model(**kwargs)
            # 'logits' will have shape [batch_size, 1]
            return outputs
    
    def compute_regression_metrics(eval_pred):
        predictions, labels = eval_pred
        # predictions shape: [batch_size, 1], labels: [batch_size]
        predictions = predictions.squeeze()
        mse = ((predictions - labels)**2).mean().item()
        pearson = torch.corrcoef(torch.stack((predictions, labels)))[0, 1].item()
        return {"mse": mse, "pearson": pearson}
    
    training_args = TrainingArguments(
        output_dir="./regression_nli",
        evaluation_strategy="epoch",
        per_device_train_batch_size=16,
        per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
        num_train_epochs=3,
    )
    
    model = RegressionModelForNLI("distilbert-base-uncased")
    
    # Assume 'train_dataset' and 'eval_dataset' have features 'input_ids', 'attention_mask', and 'labels'
    trainer = Trainer(
        model=model,
        args=training_args,
        train_dataset=train_dataset,
        eval_dataset=eval_dataset,
        compute_metrics=compute_regression_metrics
    )
    
    trainer.train()
    ```
    
    *   **Note**: You may need to adjust the data collator or the forward pass depending on your exact use case.
    *   **Important**: Setting `num_labels=1` in `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` changes the final layer to output a single scalar, and typically uses MSE by default (or you can manually override with a custom training step in `Trainer`).
*   **Actionable Tips**
    
    *   Start with a small dataset to ensure your code runs and the model trains without exploding losses.
    *   Consider collecting or generating training examples where you genuinely have a spectrum of associations. Synthetic data might help if you only have binary-labeled data.
    *   Evaluate with correlation metrics (Pearson, Spearman) to confirm the model learns the ranking and spacing of associations.
    *   Use **early stopping** to avoid overfitting.
    *   If you still need a final “entailment or not” decision, choose a threshold (e.g., 0.5) on the continuous output. This retains the continuous nature while offering a binary label when necessary.

*   **Questions for Strategic Reflection**
    
    1.  What is the annotation process for deciding the numeric association? Are human annotators comfortable with a continuous scale?
    2.  Will you need a threshold-based approach for some downstream tasks?
    3.  How do you plan to handle ambiguous or contradictory examples (e.g., where multiple annotators disagree on association scores)?
    4.  Could there be domain-specific guidelines (e.g., in medicine or law) that require an interpretable threshold for “entails vs. not”?

By shifting from a classification head to a regression head, you can accommodate fine-grained “association scores” within your NLI model. This approach captures the degree of semantic relatedness more naturally than forced binary labels.



Yes, you can modify a Natural Language Inference (NLI) model to handle real-number labels (regression) instead of binary/class-based labels (classification). Here’s how to approach this:

---

### **Step 1: Understand the Model Architecture**
Most NLI models (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa) use a **classification head** with cross-entropy loss for entailment/non-entailment. To support regression:
- Replace the classification head with a **regression head** (e.g., a single neuron with sigmoid activation to output values in `[0, 1]`).
- Use a **regression loss function** like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Smooth L1 Loss instead of cross-entropy.

---

### **Step 2: Modify the Model Code**
#### **Example in PyTorch**:
```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load a pre-trained model with a regression head
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
    "bert-base-uncased",
    num_labels=1,  # Single output neuron for regression
    problem_type="regression"  # Explicitly set regression mode
)

# Modify the classifier to use sigmoid (if not already included)
import torch.nn as nn
model.classifier = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(model.config.hidden_size, 1),
    nn.Sigmoid()  # Ensures output is between 0 and 1
)
```

---

### **Step 3: Adjust the Loss Function**
Use a regression-compatible loss:
```python
import torch

class RegressionTrainer(Trainer):
    def compute_loss(self, model, inputs, return_outputs=False):
        labels = inputs.pop("labels")
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        logits = outputs.logits.squeeze()  # Shape: (batch_size,)
        loss = torch.nn.functional.mse_loss(logits, labels.float())
        return (loss, outputs) if return_outputs else loss
```

---

### **Step 4: Prepare the Dataset**
Ensure your dataset uses float labels (0.0 to 1.0) instead of integers. For example:
```python
from datasets import Dataset

dataset = Dataset.from_dict({
    "premise": ["Sentence 1", "Sentence 2", ...],
    "hypothesis": ["Hypothesis 1", "Hypothesis 2", ...],
    "label": [0.8, 0.2, 0.5, ...]  # Float values!
})
```

---

### **Step 5: Training Configuration**
Use a smaller learning rate for fine-tuning regression tasks (since labels are continuous):
```python
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="results",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    logging_dir="logs",
)
```

---

### **Step 6: Train the Model**
```python
trainer = RegressionTrainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset["train"],
    eval_dataset=dataset["test"],
)
trainer.train()
```

---

### **Step 7: Inference**
During inference, the model will output values between 0 and 1:
```python
def predict_entailment(premise, hypothesis):
    inputs = tokenizer(premise, hypothesis, return_tensors="pt")
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.logits.sigmoid().item()  # Convert to probability
```

---

### **Key Considerations**
1. **Loss Function**: MSE works for most cases, but if you want to emphasize ranking (e.g., strongly vs. weakly associated), consider **Pairwise Ranking Loss** or **Cosine Similarity Loss**.
2. **Evaluation Metrics**: Use metrics like:
   - **Pearson/Spearman Correlation**: Measures monotonic relationships.
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute difference between predicted and true scores.
3. **Label Distribution**: If your labels are skewed (e.g., mostly near 0 or 1), apply techniques like **label smoothing** or **re-sampling**.

---

### **Why This Works**
By treating the problem as regression instead of classification, the model learns to predict **degrees of association** rather than discrete classes. The sigmoid activation ensures outputs are bounded in `[0, 1]`, aligning with your label requirements.

### Communicate with team

In our NLI model, instead of using binary labels (e.g., "entailment" vs. "non-entailment"), we propose assigning each sentence pair a continuous score between 0 and 1 that represents the degree of semantic association. By employing a regression-based approach—replacing the classification head with a single scalar output and using an appropriate loss function such as mean squared error—we can capture more nuanced relationships between text pairs, enabling the model to learn subtle distinctions that would otherwise be lost in a strict classification setting.
