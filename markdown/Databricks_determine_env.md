To dynamically determine which environment (development, staging, or production) your Python package is running in within Databricks, you can leverage unique properties or configurations specific to each Databricks workspace. Here are several **out-of-the-box** strategies you can implement:

1.  **Use Workspace URLs or Identifiers:** Each Databricks workspace has a unique URL or identifier. You can extract this information programmatically and map it to your environments.
    
    ```python
    import re
    import os
    
    def detect_environment():
        # Attempt to retrieve the workspace URL from environment variables
        workspace_url = os.environ.get('DATABRICKS_HOST') or os.environ.get('DATABRICKS_WORKSPACE_URL')
        
        if not workspace_url:
            # Fallback: Attempt to get it from Spark configuration
            try:
                workspace_url = spark.conf.get("spark.databricks.workspaceUrl")
            except Exception:
                pass
        
        if not workspace_url:
            raise EnvironmentError("Unable to determine the Databricks workspace URL.")
        
        # Define patterns to match workspace URLs to environments
        if re.search(r'dev\.yourdomain\.com', workspace_url):
            return 'development'
        elif re.search(r'staging\.yourdomain\.com', workspace_url):
            return 'staging'
        elif re.search(r'prod\.yourdomain\.com', workspace_url):
            return 'production'
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"Unknown workspace URL: {workspace_url}")
    
    # Usage
    environment = detect_environment()
    config = load_config(environment)
    ```
    
    **Advantages:**
    
    *   **No Manual Configuration Needed:** Automatically detects based on workspace properties.
    *   **Scalable:** Easily extendable to more environments if needed.
    
    **Considerations:**
    
    *   Ensure that workspace URLs are consistent and uniquely identifiable per environment.
2.  **Set Custom Spark Configuration Parameters:** Define a custom Spark configuration parameter in each workspace that explicitly specifies the environment. This method provides a clear and controlled way to identify the environment.
    
    **Step 1: Set the Configuration in Each Workspace**
    
    *   **Development Workspace:**
        
        ```python
        spark.conf.set("spark.environment", "development")
        ```
        
    *   **Staging Workspace:**
        
        ```python
        spark.conf.set("spark.environment", "staging")
        ```
        
    *   **Production Workspace:**
        
        ```python
        spark.conf.set("spark.environment", "production")
        ```
        
    
    **Step 2: Detect and Load Configuration in Your Package**
    
    ```python
    def detect_environment():
        return spark.conf.get("spark.environment", "development")  # Default to 'development' if not set
    
    # Usage
    environment = detect_environment()
    config = load_config(environment)
    ```
    
    **Advantages:**
    
    *   **Explicit Configuration:** Clear declaration of environment.
    *   **Flexibility:** Easy to change or update without altering workspace URLs.
    
    **Considerations:**
    
    *   Requires setting the Spark configuration in each workspace, which might involve additional setup steps.
3.  **Leverage Environment Variables:** Set environment-specific variables in each Databricks workspace that your package can read to determine the current environment.
    
    **Step 1: Set Environment Variables in Each Workspace**
    
    *   **Development Workspace:**
        
        ```bash
        export ENVIRONMENT=development
        ```
        
    *   **Staging Workspace:**
        
        ```bash
        export ENVIRONMENT=staging
        ```
        
    *   **Production Workspace:**
        
        ```bash
        export ENVIRONMENT=production
        ```
        
    
    **Step 2: Access the Variable in Your Package**
    
    ```python
    import os
    
    def detect_environment():
        return os.getenv('ENVIRONMENT', 'development')  # Default to 'development' if not set
    
    # Usage
    environment = detect_environment()
    config = load_config(environment)
    ```
    
    **Advantages:**
    
    *   **Simplicity:** Easy to implement and manage.
    *   **Environment Isolation:** Each workspace can have distinct environment variables.
    
    **Considerations:**
    
    *   Ensure that environment variables are securely managed and correctly set in each workspace.
4.  **Utilize Databricks Secrets or Configuration Files:** Store environment identifiers in Databricks Secrets or configuration files stored in DBFS. Your package can then read these secrets or files to determine the environment.
    
    **Example Using Secrets:**
    
    *   **Store a Secret in Each Workspace:**
        
        *   **Key:** `ENVIRONMENT`
        *   **Value:** `development`, `staging`, or `production`
    *   **Access the Secret in Your Package:**
        
        ```python
        def detect_environment():
            try:
                return dbutils.secrets.get(scope="your_scope", key="ENVIRONMENT")
            except Exception as e:
                raise EnvironmentError("Unable to retrieve environment from secrets.") from e
        
        # Usage
        environment = detect_environment()
        config = load_config(environment)
        ```
        
    
    **Advantages:**
    
    *   **Security:** Secrets are securely managed.
    *   **Centralized Management:** Easier to update and manage environment identifiers.
    
    **Considerations:**
    
    *   Requires setting up Databricks Secrets and managing access appropriately.
5.  **Inspect Cluster Tags or Metadata:** Assign specific tags or metadata to clusters in each environment and have your package read these tags to determine the environment.
    
    **Step 1: Tag Clusters Appropriately**
    
    *   **Development Cluster:** Tag with `env=development`
    *   **Staging Cluster:** Tag with `env=staging`
    *   **Production Cluster:** Tag with `env=production`
    
    **Step 2: Access Cluster Tags in Your Package**
    
    ```python
    def detect_environment():
        try:
            tags = spark.conf.get("spark.databricks.cluster.tags")
            if 'env' in tags:
                return tags['env']
            else:
                raise ValueError("Environment tag not found.")
        except Exception as e:
            raise EnvironmentError("Unable to retrieve cluster tags.") from e
    
    # Usage
    environment = detect_environment()
    config = load_config(environment)
    ```
    
    **Advantages:**
    
    *   **Integration with Cluster Management:** Environment info is tied to cluster configuration.
    *   **Dynamic Detection:** Automatically adapts based on the running cluster.
    
    **Considerations:**
    
    *   Ensure that all clusters are correctly tagged.
    *   Accessing cluster tags might require specific permissions or APIs.

* * *

**Choosing the Right Approach:**

*   **Simplicity & Control:** If you prefer explicit control and simplicity, using custom Spark configurations or environment variables is recommended.
*   **Security:** If environment identifiers contain sensitive information, leveraging Databricks Secrets ensures secure management.
*   **Integration with Cluster Management:** If your workflow heavily relies on cluster configurations, inspecting cluster tags or metadata provides seamless integration.

**Example Implementation Using Custom Spark Configuration:**

```python
# In each Databricks workspace, set the Spark configuration:
# spark.conf.set("spark.environment", "development")  # For Development
# spark.conf.set("spark.environment", "staging")      # For Staging
# spark.conf.set("spark.environment", "production")   # For Production

# In your Python package:
def load_config(environment):
    if environment == 'development':
        return dev_config
    elif environment == 'staging':
        return staging_config
    elif environment == 'production':
        return prod_config
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported environment: {environment}")

def detect_environment():
    return spark.conf.get("spark.environment", "development")  # Defaults to 'development'

# Usage
environment = detect_environment()
config = load_config(environment)

# Now use `config` for your database authentication settings
```

This approach ensures that your package dynamically adapts to the environment it's running in without manual intervention each time you switch environments.
