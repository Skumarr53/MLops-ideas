### Hosting Documentation on GitHub for Private Organization Repositories

It's great that you're considering hosting your documentation on GitHub. I'll address your questions and guide you through setting up your documentation in a way that meets your requirements.

* * *

#### **1\. Hosting Documentation from a Private Organization Repository**

**Question:**  
_We have a private organization repository. Is it possible to host the documentation in this setup? If so, can the link be restricted to allowed users, such as those who have access to the repository and any users we permit?_

**Answer:**

**GitHub Pages and Private Repositories:**

*   **GitHub Pages** allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.
*   For **public repositories**, GitHub Pages sites are public and accessible to anyone.
*   For **private repositories**, hosting GitHub Pages is available **only** if you have a **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** plan.

**Access Control:**

*   With **GitHub Enterprise Cloud**, you can host private GitHub Pages sites that are accessible **only** to authenticated users with read access to the repository.
*   You can manage access through your organization's user and team permissions.

**Summary:**

*   **Yes**, it's possible to host documentation from a private organization repository **if** you have a GitHub Enterprise Cloud subscription.
*   The link to the documentation can be restricted to users who have access to the repository.

* * *

#### **2\. Accessibility of the Webpage**

**Question:**  
_Will the webpage be accessible at all times?_

**Answer:**

*   **Availability:** GitHub Pages is a reliable service with high uptime. Your documentation will be accessible at all times, barring any service interruptions from GitHub.
*   **Access Control:** Users will need to authenticate with GitHub to view the documentation, ensuring only authorized personnel can access it.

* * *

#### **3\. Setting Up the Documentation Page**

Since your requests are feasible, here's how to set up the documentation on GitHub using your private repository:

* * *

##### **Prerequisites:**

*   **GitHub Enterprise Cloud Subscription:** Ensure your organization has a GitHub Enterprise Cloud plan.
*   **Administrative Access:** You have admin permissions for your GitHub organization and repository.

* * *

##### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

**Step 1: Prepare Your Documentation**

1.  **Build Your Documentation Locally:**
    
    *   Navigate to your documentation directory:
        
        ```bash
        
        cd docs
        ```
        
    *   Build the HTML files using Sphinx:
        
        ```bash
        make html
        ```
        
    *   The HTML files will be in the `docs/_build/html/` directory.
        

**Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages**

1.  **Create a `gh-pages` Branch:**
    
    *   In your repository, create a new branch named `gh-pages`.
    *   This branch will host the built HTML files.
2.  **Set Up GitHub Pages:**
    
    *   Go to your repository on GitHub.
    *   Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
    *   Under **Source**, select the `gh-pages` branch and the root folder (`/`).
    *   Save the settings.

**Step 3: Automate Documentation Deployment**

1.  **Set Up GitHub Actions Workflow:**
    
    *   Create a workflow file at `.github/workflows/deploy_docs.yml` in your repository.
        
    *   Add the following content:
        
        ```yaml
        
        name: Deploy Documentation
        
        on:
          push:
            branches: [ main ]
        
        jobs:
          build-and-deploy:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
              - name: Check out the repository
                uses: actions/checkout@v2
        
              - name: Set up Python
                uses: actions/setup-python@v2
                with:
                  python-version: '3.8'
        
              - name: Install dependencies
                run: |
                  pip install -r requirements.txt
                  pip install sphinx
        
              - name: Build the documentation
                run: |
                  cd docs
                  make html
        
              - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
                uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
                with:
                  github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
                  publish_dir: docs/_build/html
                  publish_branch: gh-pages
        ```
        
    *   This workflow will automatically build and deploy your documentation to the `gh-pages` branch whenever you push to `main`.
        

**Step 4: Restrict Access to the Documentation**

1.  **Manage Repository Access:**
    
    *   Ensure that only authorized users have read access to the repository.
    *   In your organization's settings, manage team and user permissions.
2.  **Authentication:**
    
    *   Users will need to log in to GitHub with their authorized accounts to access the documentation.

**Step 5: Inform Your Users**

*   **Share the Documentation Link:**
    
    *   The documentation will be accessible at `https://<your-organization>.github.io/<your-repository>/`
    *   Example: `https://your-org.github.io/your-repo/`
*   **Access Instructions:**
    
    *   Instruct users to log in to GitHub if prompted.
    *   Ensure they have read access to the repository.

* * *

        *   Provide users with the URL to access the documentation.
*   **Considerations:**
    
    *   Requires internal infrastructure.
    *   Access is limited to users within the network or VPN.

* * *

##### **Option 3: Distribute Documentation Files**
